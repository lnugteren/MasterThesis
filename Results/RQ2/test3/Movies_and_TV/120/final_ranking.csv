0;2;101;0.9043475723010835;triumph of the will has long been viewed through a dual perspective it is both reviled by many for its glorification of hitler and at the same time praised for the masterful work of its director the legendary leni riefenstahl who at the time of this writing is still alive i think she s over 100 by now the truth is it is all of that and more a highly memorable fascinating experience on several levels n1 despite the subject matter it must be acknowledged that this film does what it was made to do marvelously well it is a masterpiece of the art of propaganda somethng that is practiced every day by all governments in advertising and in all political campaigns but never better than this the film does an amazing job of tapping deep into the german psyche with scenes of nuremburg youth etc and allusions to great germans of the past all designed to tug at the volkish national sentiment then deftly superimposed with images of hitler very crafty but no different than what we see every day in our media saturated world n2 as a study of the early the nazi era it is invaluable regardless of what happened in the years that followed triumph needs to be viewed as a statement of its own era when none of the horrors had yet happened and many around the world still referred to the nazi regime which was then consolidating power and trying to reach the hearts and minds of the people as the german renaissance the commentary track adds a fascinating what happened to that nazi perspective n3 this film has become unbelievably influential possibly because it is still required viewing in film schools it is perhaps second only to the battleship potemkin as the most visually quoted film in hstory just a few examples the closing scene in star wars be prepared from the lion king and especially the entrance of commodus into rome from gladiator are all lifted directly from visuals in triumph even more common is the visual homage that directors sometimes subtly insert such as the woman being tossed in the air from the big lebowski remember the kid at the beginning of triumph the list goes on and on none certainly does not need to sympathize with the nazis to appreciate this film in fact it is precisely because of what became of them that makes this early look so fascinating still i would not call this entertainment rather this is a piece to study and analyze recommended for any student of history sociology mass media or film
1;69;69;0.8994643633282691;important to see for many reasons triumph of the will is a masterful example of cinematography the forerunner of propaganda documentaries and a remarkable piece of history where we get to see some of the most sinister men that ever lived and the world of extravagance and power that surrounded them nwe also get to see a seemingly hypnotized people who took pride in what was going on in their country and women who gazed adoringly at a strange weaselly looking man with a cowlick and silly mustache the people who went along with all this were the same people who read goethe and listened to beethoven one of the most highly cultured civilized people of recent history proving that intelligence and education does not prevent brainwashing or political madness and evil n nfilmed on september 4 10 1934 there is tremendous symbolism used starting with the aerial footage of hitler arriving in nuremberg through the clouds as though he were a god coming to save his people for those who viewed this film in germany during the mid to late 30s who had never been on an airplane this footage must have been spectacular also marvelous are the views of the city seen from the air so much of it since bombed and then re built nlike all propagandists riefenstahl started with the message and spliced and diced her film to fit it she just did a better job of it than anyone else has since and unfortunately it ruined her career as a filmmaker and as she would say later it cast a shadow over her life n nthe vastness of the scenes has never been achieved in any hollywood epic the ocean of saluting arms the endless line of marching men the sheer enormity of the commemoration of the dead ceremony where riefenstahl had cameras set up high for panoramic views and where hitler gave one of his fiery speeches there are also a multitude of happy tow headed children strong firm jawed youths and those salivating women looking at hitler this is a trip down the rabbit hole and a strong reminder that as george santayana said those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it n nit is fascinating to watch this with the added commentary by historian dr anthony santoro which sheds a lot of light on the events as well as watching it with subtitles and if you want to get the full impact view it with no subtitles just the german and the rather wagnerian soundtrack total running time is 120 minutes nthe dvd extra is day of freedom a 20 minute film of a military exercise exhibition that is brilliantly filmed and absolutely riveting nrecommended viewing for the evil of our present time is the dvd buried in the sand

4;42;47;0.8911029416653866;having seen the wonderful horrible life of leni riefenstahl i thought i had seen triumph of the will right at the beginning of ray mller s documentary 1993 a shot of marching nazis from triumph is juxtaposed with a large school of little pink fish from the footage for riefenstahl s recent underwater impressions and the effect is rather funny the marching monsters still look scary enough but the school of fish immediately puts this impression into a comical perspective n nlittle did i know the 1993 documentary contains many sections from triumph but the effect of watching triumph of the will triumph des willens 1935 in its entirety is very different indeed forget about comical perspectives with the exception of a cat catching a glimpse at the fhrer riefenstahl s film of the 1934 nazi party congress in nuremberg financed by the nazi government and commissioned by hitler himself is serious monumentally serious perspectives projected by the film which does n t contain a single reconstructed scene riefenstahl are accumulated in the style and service of the militaristic ceremonies they document and surely with the intend to inspire awe quite organically in fact does riefenstahl s mis en scene grow out of the nazi rhetoric itself the goose stepping shadows of marching sa men reinforcing her imagology in the same way as the flashy gestures of the orators reinforce the aggressive delivery of their screamed slogans sieg heil sieg heil sieg heil argumentum ad nauseam is indeed a technique of propaganda generation and if a self proclaimed artistic documentary starts to mimic the cultivated stupidity of the documented it should not only be accused of collaboration with organized idiocy it should be accused of the ultimate achievement of having crystallized the images of banal militaristic rhetoric into something glorious and sumptuous a colossal apotheosis of power and kitsch hitler kitsch it is the divine presence of the fhrer which is towering above the elevated center of this carefully constructed montage the party is hitler screams deputy fhrer rudolf hess but hitler is germany as germany is hitler ein volk ein reich ein fhrer und ein film n nironically though triumph of the will is a very interesting film if seen by a moderately educated viewer today our knowledge of wwii the images of nazi atrocities holocaust concentration camps etc which have become part of the collective memory and last not least our over saturation with modern propaganda and advertisement function quite effectively as the de kitsching distance which the film itself fails to provide while our senses will still be numbed our minds can no longer be seduced riefenstahl claims that she was not really interested in the political content of the speeches and presented the chosen sections entirely for the dramatic impact which she observed from the gestures as well as from the degree of audience enthusiasm we can thus witness an impressive collection of rhetorical climaxes in very quick succession and this allows us to understand the essential nazi gesture a people that does not protect its racial purity will perish screams gauleiter julius streicher his massive bald head filling the entire screen his hand stretches out imploringly on people clenches into a fist on purity and in a powerful cadence crushes down on us with perish he must have rehearsed this pure martial gesture a thousand times in front of a mirror the nazi rhetoric is basically a rhythmic tour de force while completely ignoring strength of argument or logic it concentrates entirely on accumulation of powerful slogans sound bites cadences and the complete elimination of weak gestures it is a highly ritualized rhetoric of archaic of brutal of bombastic mantras a militaristic rhetoric which is used as a weapon against the chaos of decadent democracy n nkitsch in the totalitarian realm of nazi aesthetics is the absolute denial of weakness interestingly an earlier riefenstahl propaganda documentary of the 1933 nazi party congress the victory of faith der sieg des glaubens shows many technical problems and frequently exposes hitler in awkward moments interviewed by guy mller riefenstahl appeared to be genuinely furious about this 60 years later and refused to even call it a film n nthis special edition also features riefenstahl s short day of freedom tag der freiheit 1935 about the wehrmacht very similar stylistically to triumph as well as historian dr anthony r santoro s excellent commentary

6;19;94;0.8748249648299122;it is so easy in hindsight to vilify leni riefenstahl for making one of the most powerful and influential films of all time after all there is little doubt she was a genius in her field and the fact that she lent her talents to the nazi party to make this great propoganda film frightens us to no end how could such an artistic genius serve pure evil we ask well what of the world that applauded triumph of the will in 1934 what of the french who gave this movie their highest honors and awards in 1935 and what of all the articles and reviews in england and in this country which tripped over themselves in praise and admiration for this film in 1934 and 1935 if leni riefenstahl is guilty of serving evil so too is the rest of the world which paid this film incredible homage when it first appeared n n this is a breath taking film the direction techniques and editing are truly remarkable that riefenstahl was way ahead of her time is not in question the question is whether or not the times have yet to catch up to her genius as a film maker n moral certainty was a rare commodity when it came to national socialism in the early and mid l930 s admiration for hitler was globally more common than we d care to admit these days diplomats and journalists all over the world were praising germany s economic recovery under hitler s leadership at the time when leni riefenstahl accepted the commission to film a nazi rally in nurenberg hitler had yet to expose the evil he would soon unleash upon the world n i am not an apologist for riefenstahl however she never made another film for the nazi party after l934 and for that we should all be thankful we should be thankful because had this woman chosen to serve the nazis into the late 1930 s and early l940 s those films would have served hitler as well as any weapon system if triumph of the will is riefenstahl being non political one shudders to think what she would have created on celluloid were she a true believer n riefenstahl frightens us with her talent her manipulation of the audience makes hitchcock seem like an amatuer her techniques lighting editing and camera angles make citizen kane just another run of the mill movie and her ability to seduce the viewer is unparrelled see triumph of the will and get a glimpse of a rare talent and a genius at work and then be grateful that she stopped making movies when she did
7;54;43;0.8696048881791894;this is an important film in understanding a powerful and terrible historical epic n nthe thing that we in our time fail at is to disapprove of someone for the right reasons the true historical significance of hitler and the nazis is not well known n nan earlier reviewer ntioned that germany was in a wretched state economically and morally when the nazis started to vie for power this can not be denied nor can it be denied that hitler repaired germany s economy and in an astonishingly short period of time brought germany to the forefront of world power n nwhat is not understood is the true threat that hitler posed the 25 points of the national aryan socialist party were a list of goals that they wished to achieve number 11 clearly stated that they wished to eliminate interest banking and felt that it was crippling europe s economy of course they blamed the jews but this broad stroke was clearly one of hitler s failures and the genesis of his implemented genocide n nwhat is significant is that once hitler declared this the international banking cartels realized that he was a threat to them any nation who seeks economic autonomy can not be tolerated in fact almost all the wars that have been fought in the last two and a half centuries were merely business deals gone sour n nhitler never wanted war with england it was in churchil s interests to instigate war owing to his being a puppet for the international financial elite n nhaving said that there is the quality of the nation state and its upliftment wherein hitler was a pioneer and trailblazer he was the first to use the technological method to achieve his aims he was the first human being to appear on a public tv broadcast he used radio and tv and in this case cinema to great effect the holocaust was distinctive only in that it was the worlds first application of technological method towards genocide unfortunately not the last n nwatching his speech in this movie was a lesson in the manipulation of public opinion and in human psychology there was within hitler and his methods a cynicism and utter contempt concerning the general state of the people consider the following quotes n i reserve reason for the few and emotion for the many n if i approached my audiences with reasoned arguments they would n t understand me their intelligence is small i must reduce my philosophies to four or five very simple points which i repeat over and over again until my words become like commands under hypnosis n nthis is the general opinion he had of the majority of people and if you examine any modern politician s speeches they use the exact same methods of addressing their audiences n nms reinfenstahl s brilliant cinematography upheld this in an eloquent manner n nhitler wrote the book on how to effectively set up and maintain a technological tyranny and his techniques have proven effective especially when his mistakes are avoided he was just too obvious too much ego n nwe ca n t say we were n t warned
8;76;56;0.8567990542210153;this movie is a masterpiece you do however have to approach it with the right frame of mind n nit s very similar to 2001 a space odyssey in that it s an experience rather than being a movie the same ones who were bored with 2001 will be bored here too not much happens triumph of the will is a documentary with very little plot the viewer needs to try to watch it in the spirit of the times and try to absorb everything that is going on if you re expecting a high action movie better skip this one n nprevious reviews have intellectualized the movie while this has tremendous merit viewers who have n t seen the movie do n t really know what to expect when they buy it n nit starts out with hitler coming out of the clouds like some demi god he lands the plane exits to a hysterical crowd and travels through a spectacularly beautiful nuremberg to get to the events you get to see volumes of ecstatic german populace worshipping him while you worship the beautiful scenery too bad it s gone now n nthen you see preparations for the event schoolkids sleeping in tents frolicking around having a good time eating washing up each other in the shower etc one does get a feeling of some nascient homoeroticism n nthe movie then moves into the festivities n nyou watch massive formations of humans perhaps 200 000 of them alternately marching in formation forming spectacular displays of choreography avowing their reverence for the fuhrer while interspersed with speeches made by leading nazis the choreography is hypnotic mesmerizing it ll remind you somewhat of those busby berkely movies from the 30s and the speeches are n t boring at least to me you see glimpses of the german mindset before all the bad stuff happened in ww2 they only last about 15 minutes anyway n nall this eventually segues into several minutes of marching this might bore the viewer it does seem to go on and on n nms riefenstahl has said that she was forced to direct the music herself the marches and the music were all out of sychronization so at her hands the music alternately speeds up and slows down to the marching if you watch these sequences with this in mind and pay attention to the music you ll find the marching not at all boring and short lived even n nall this pageantry ends with a short speech by hess hitler is germany etc it s a rousing finale n ni was utterly absorbed by this movie and have seen it three times highly recommended
9;60;10;0.8481023500600747;leni riefenstahl 1902 2003 began her career as a dancer progressed to film roles and ultimately moved into cinematography editing and directing adolph hiter was among her many fans and although she herself was never a member of the nazi party hitler asked her create a film about it titled victory of the faith the 1933 film included significant footage of ernst rohm and when he fell out of favor and was executed the film more or less died with him only one copy survived and it is rarely seen even so it developed the foundation for riefenstahl s next film a depiction of the 1934 nazi congress in nuremberg it was titled triumph of the will n nmany records perished during world war ii and those pertaining to triumph of the will are not excepted although she would later deny that the project was pre planned in any real sense riefenstahl s crew consisted of 172 people a number that could hardly be managed without considerable advance thought it also appears that riefenstahl went to nuremberg to have camera tracks and boom shot devices installed in strategic locations long before hitler arrived reifenstahl also deployed as many as thirty cameras from scene to scene most them apparently predetermined positions and one or two scenes have the sense of being actively directed hitler and his entourage were certainly well aware that they were being filmed and at times repeated portions of their speeches for the sake of a better camera shot the organizers of the congress were instruced to be as camera friendly as possible and even went so far as to dig ditches to allow riefenstahl to get the shots she wanted over the course of about four days riefenstahl and her crew shot an incredible sixty plus hours of film riefenstahl herself edited the film to a run time of two hours even at this length historians estimate that the triumph of the will presents film footage showing about thirty thousand people n nin later years riefenstahl stated that hilter had asked to make the film because she was apolitical and he wanted a film that would appeal to just such people he did not riefenstahl said want a political film and the film that she delivered is notable for that fact ironically the very absence of nazi politics and policy makes them even more obvious than they might have been if they had been included but riefenstahl s emphasis is on imagery impossibly large crowds masses of flags endless arrays of torches incredible bits of scaffolding and rows of standard bearers triumph of the will is visually staggering to the same degree as such films as intolerance and the battle ship potemkin her editing is a grand affair with exceptional tempo her black and white imagery is extraordinary her eye is indeed a great one and although she made less than a dozen films triumph of the will gained riefenstahl the reputation as one of the greatest film artists of the 20th century n nthere is a notion that triumph of the will received universal critical acclaim when it opened in 1935 that is not entirely true the film was a great success in germany won awards in paris and dazzled producers in hollywood but it received mixed reviews most were impressed with the imagery and cinematography and editing but some found the structure commonplace and of course by 1935 the nature of nazi germany had become increasingly apparent around the world and a good many people condemned the film for its visual glorification of the nazi party and these criticisms have continued to this day and i have to agree that the entire look of the film is essentially a flowering of fascist art n neven so there is an irony to triumph of the will that not even riefenstahl could have imagined we know what will happen to these people who parade in the streets who cheer and wave and dance and parade i was repeatedly caught by the young children who smiled and laughed how many of them i wondered lived they danced many of them willingly right into the mouth of hell with adolph hitler leading the way seen at this level and balanced against later documentaries such the shocking army signal corps footage of the concentration camps and such feature films such as the 1979 kitty return to auschwitz my god but it is disturbing deeply disturbing and incredibly sad n nthere are a great many dvd releases of triumph of the will this review is of the special edition by synapse films and includes a commentary by dr anthony r santoro which i found very erudite but perhaps somewhat dry it also includes a short riefenstahl film day of freedom made to placate members of the military who felt triumph of the will had given then short shift it too is remarkable for its imagery the elements have not been restored in a major sense certainly not a digital sense but the film is sharp enough for us to see the sweat on hitler s brow and the sound is quite good it is hard to recommend such film but at the same time i feel everyone should see it at least once evil wears a mask and very often it is one of remarkable grace it is best to know that n ngft amazon reviewer nfor nicky faithful feline companion for a decade gone before his time

12;110;107;0.8206586405268657;the first thing you will notice after triumph of the will is that there is no narration only the sound of the speeches or the rallies not all of them electrifying some scenes just mundane marches through the altstadt hitler of course is strangely fascinating there is no other word and effete it is said that he studied and mimicked the expressions of opera singers the expressions of pain he wanted you to feel his pain and not triumph which is why the title is so ironic there is also a strong homoerotic ambience especially when hitler exhorts a stadium of young men to hardness and struggle there is not a far leap from the wandervogel to the hitler youth consider also albert speer s love for hitler erik erikson in an essay that was the first to use the now common notion of identity in its contemporary meaning interpreted hitler as a kind of leader of an adolescent gang in a society of paterfamilias the hitler of the triumph of the will is that gang leader
13;71;41;0.8118006669827156;although the star of this film is among the most controversial men of the xxth century leni riefenstahl made a film of unprecedented power in 1934 the techniques she used are often used today but the simple employment of camera angles and vistas combined with mesmerizng music tell the story that hilter wanted told it is spectacular as an historical document and in its comparative simplicity it is a extraordinary opportunity to see how films lenses and proportion can be used to tell a story or spin a tale for me it is the crystal ball that demonstrates how easy it is for genius to influence the masses and how this medium of visual imagery and music can persuade people in the millions to accept the leadership of a demagogue

16;1;5;0.7822179408681954;2015 blu ray review triumph of the will is a public domain film it belongs to everyone but synapse and film preserve ltd has attempted to assert copyright over it by inserting logo bugs in the corner of the frame every ten minutes and burning in explanatory subtitles over the top throughout the film this movie is very important to the history of film not because it is a nazi film but rather because riefenstahl was a brilliant cinematographer each and every cut in the film is masterfully composed and beautifully lit however with the constant barrage of type and logos over the top it s impossible to follow the visual flow of the film n nthe film transfer and sound quality is excellent but this blu ray version has been rendered unwatchable by constant graphic intrusions when i first tried to screen it i could n t believe that anyone would intentionally deface it like this surely the overwritten text was intended to be able to be turned off and this is a simple mastering error but robert harris the gentleman who restored the film has stated online that the principle reason for the barrage of subtitles was to prevent piracy n nlogo bugs and burned in non removable graphic markings are what i expect in dollar store dvds not full priced blu rays billed as ultimate editions marking films that belong to the public like a dog marks a tree only cheats the customer who buys the product it does n t prevent piracy recently large studios have resorted to reworking and re editing films and removing the original from circulation in an attempt to extend their control over copyright it is very discouraging to see film preservationists following their lead n nimagine if the louvre put their logo in the corner of the mona lisa and wrote some explanatory text over the top of the painting if art belongs to the world it belongs to the world we should n t deface it to try to claim it as our own n ni ca n t express how disappointed i am i m returning this disk to amazon for a refund i suggest that if you are interested in triumph of the will buy the most recent dvd release instead it is identical to this release albeit in standard definition and has no burned in subtitles or logo bugs in the corner
17;91;14;0.736698865667829;propaganda today s movies newspapers tv shows books can be considered propaganda for propaganda is a general term n ngiven that said triumph of the will is a historical documentary of events as it happens no re enactments non fiction and filmed on location n na few historical facts n n1 adolf hitler and the nsdap was just a political party with nationalist socialist goals a legally elected party of a population of 70 million or so think democrats or republicans n n2 germany had 6 years of peace ignoring the propaganda war by the usa others from 1933 thru 1939 economic programs initiated by adolf hitler and the nsdap created jobs and the autobahn germany before 1945 under adolf hitler and the nsdap had their own germanic culture economics nationalizing of companies and such and banking system zero interest loans for starters n n3 poland a nation of 20 years created by the usa imposed treaty of versailles poland was originally germany for 200 years poland had two military dictators the first dictator was ok with adolf hitler non aggression pacts and agreements the first one died and the second polish military dictator was a menace after all the newly created nation of poland had a blank check guarantee from england and france adolf hitler was forced to take action against half of poland poland was threatening germany russia invaded the other half two weeks later bottom line the invasion of poland was a regional conflict not worth a world war n n4 adolf hitler was trying to save a nation called the german empire united in 1871 ww1 and the treaty of versailles took advantage of a weak germany germany was forced to accept territorial concessions poland and czechoslovakia 70 year fines and military occupation much more than just the war guilt clause the treaty of versailles was all about control and redefining an independent european nation called the german empire in reality germany was fighting a 30 year war 1914 thru 1945 adolf hitler was elected reichspresident in 1933 n n5 adolf hitler the nsdap and germany before 1945 were the good guys american gi s and the public were tricked into war with germany the anti german propaganda was downright silly at the time and today n n6 one must break free from culturally ingrained 70 years worth of propaganda i have n n7 finally i enjoy watching triumph of the will i see nothing wrong with it a small tidbit of much larger historical puzzle
18;98;32;0.703762660372288;accomplished through the offices of propaganda minister joseph goebbels though he detested the idea of a woman filmmaker riefenstahl s magnificent mesmerizing masterpiece offers a powerfully instructive look at the delirium of crowds the fever pitch of 20th century nationalist politics and the megalomania of adolf hitler none of which of course was its reason for being however on the level of technical brilliance alone will is a visual monument every bit as great and ethically compromised as d w griffith s birth of a nation an undeniably accomplished work of art will is one of the more intriguing documentaries you ll ever see
19;4;4;0.534585384232124;this should have been a landmark title a historically important film finally getting an hd release but synapse have made a horrible mess of it by enforcing descriptive text on the screen at all times that veers from useful occasionally to identifying adolf hitler every time he appears it s incredibly intrusive and irritating and again it ca n t be stopped there s also a copyright protection watermark that appears every 20 minutes and malfunctioning subtitles on the supplementary film i m in the highly unfortunate position of having ordered this item internationally so i ca n t realistically return my blighted copy and it cost a lot to import synapse you should be utterly ashamed of yourselves and the various blu ray forum discussions on this issue indicate that you are about to suffer a significant backlash for your stupidity

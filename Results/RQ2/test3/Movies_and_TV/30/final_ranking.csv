0;4;13;0.77493280802416;reading many of these reviews after having seen the movie myself i ve come to the conclusion many seem to agree with this was an amazing film and those who criticize it are upset that they did n t think of the idea first it was a 9 minute independent film and yet wove through star wars george lucas and shakespeare in love so slyly that you must applaud mr nussbaum mr dowling and mr levy for an amazing piece of cinema nto those who criticize go ahead and nag the people however have spoken making it the most downloaded movie ever on the internet and i understand that mr nussbaum is the talk of hollywood as the next big director out of usc do n t take my word for it read the wall street journal people magazine and the new york times if the biggest complaint is that lucas is n t long enough it s a testament to the genius and skill of those involved bravo
1;11;23;0.7493367384244422;as far as comic shorts go this one is a gem for those of you who find fault with story developement originality etc see other reviews here i have this to say it s a short film not a feature film and so by defition it s not gon na give you what you can get in 120 minutes of screen time but what joe nussbaum does in eight minutes puts to shame most of the slop churned out in hollywood it s probably harder to do something good and funny in eight minutes than it is in a feature length film and this homage spoof delivers the goods the details are dead on the writing is crisp and funny the acting perfectly in tune with the spirit of the project so everyone just relax and enjoy lucas in love for what it is
2;8;8;0.7245597470764689;i remember clearly when hardware wars came out with my sister and me howling with laughter at the clever parody we loved spaceballs with its jabs too being a great fan of both the star wars trilogy and of shakespeare in love i was laughing out loud at this deft combination of the two done in a mere 9 minutes it s like the super fast shakespeare spoof which is making the theater rounds a blast to catch all the subtle innuendos nwhat s the cost for the video about the price of a big mac these days i d gladly pay double for the fun this has been at parties and when friends come over i do n t have this much fun with a lot of commercial sludge that s out on the big screen that s for sure well worth it but see for yourself
3;3;18;0.7236856852925775;several reviewers around here really seem to want a lot from a 9 minute film n george lucas in love was a very fun short from lucas roommate benji talking about an all powerful force to his friends hal chuck working on hal s fastest thing on campus to a professor whose speech patterns resembled a well known jedi master this film has a heck of a lot crammed into it s 9 minutes if anything the filmmakers should have done a 15 20 minute film the film was very clever and enjoyable maybe just a tad bit funnier than hardware wars nthe music cinematography and acting are all very good indeed anyone who did n t enjoy this at least a little really needs to get a sense of humor of course it s a bit cheesy but it s meant to be that way it s presented in the slightly corny overblown way that hardware wars or the naked gun films were the same people who did n t understand those films probably wo n t understand george lucas in love it s not a great film but who cares it s a fun little short by a guy who really loves star wars some have condemned the filmmakers doing this just for the money i seriously doubt that mr nussbaum will make a huge fortune from this film and if he does big deal nothing wrong with making money from doing what you love or making money at all surely none of the people who reviewed this film would go and work at their jobs for free and live in a cardboard box under a bridge somewhere anyway glil is great fun and a great to watch before your next screening of phantom menace or the original trilogy
4;14;12;0.6720883237678259;this is a very enjoyable 9 minute movie and you do n t have to be a diehard star wars fanatic to enjoy it you just have to have seen the 3 initial movies the price is a bit high 12 including shipping but worth it if you ll split the price with some friends after all blockbuster does n t have it nbut do n t look at the box or talk with people about it before watching it remember it s only 9 minutes long there are lots of scenes on the box that you ll find quite funny in the movie if you re not already anticipating them do n t lose the fun of half the movie by seeing half the jokes beforehand
5;7;29;0.6409999106871083;any fan of george lucas and of star wars i m a hardcore fan of both will love this movie it is clever witty and well crafted perfectly balancing the directorial styles of shakespeare in love steadicam shots lighting with star wars lucasian wipes close up shots pans some of the most subtle jokes were my favorite such as the womp rats line the howard the duck reference and the thx 1138 door sign nenjoy
6;19;5;0.6014462119080504;i ve seen other star wars parodies and this one is up there with the best of them not only parodying star wars but 1999 best picture shakespeare in love it is well researched into lucas undergraduate life at usc and even references 2 of his student films it also captures even the littlest and obscure star wars references a short film in 8 minutes it s worth the admission price
7;23;9;0.49218291365488104;i bought this for my husband for christmas and previewed to be sure it ran fine lol i have watched this movie short about 6 times now and everytime i watch it i see yet another reference to the star wars trilogy or shakespear in love a must have for the star wars enthusiast
8;17;2;0.4257449251121394;1967 film student george lucas has writer s block trying to finish his space wheat script until a beautiful fellow student with a familiar hairstyle teaches him that the best stories are in plain sight nfull of cleverly subtle and some not so subtle references to star wars and george lucas s other films this film has taken its place on the list of great star wars spoofs a short film that gets better with each viewing

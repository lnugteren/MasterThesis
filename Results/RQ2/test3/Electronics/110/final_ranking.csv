0;4;36;0.9450717158480924;first off i want to say that i am completely satisfied with my philips 30 hour recorder only because of the 100 dollar rebate along with a 100 dollar gift certificate that i had so i paid only 200 dollars for a product that i knew i was simply going to use to record just a few television shows i was not getting tivo because i wanted to pause or rewind live tv or record 30 hours worth of shows for 200 dollars and not expecting much from this product tivo was completely worth it i can record up to 9 hours at best quality which is equal to live tv quality i do n t like watching recordings at less than tv quality and besides 9 hours is plenty for me i m not trying to record every single show being broadcasted i hardly ever pause live tv but occassionally i will rewind a few minutes to catch something i missed or want to watch more carefully i e basketball play right after i usually fast forward back to live tv you can skip straight to live tv but by fast forwarding it s like skimming the show so that you do n t really miss anything another cool thing with tivo is that you get displays like direct tv whereas you can see the title of the show and read a short summary set up was very easy and straightforward nand now for the drawbacks of tivo which far surpasses the good things n1 unless you have a newer tv with 2 video inputs you ca n t record one show while viewing another n2 you can only rewind live tv back to the point where you changed the channel this means that if you change the channel to leno and just barely miss the punchline too bad you ca n t rewind n3 you can only pause for a max of 30 mins n4 you can only rewind to a max of 30 mins unless the show is being recorded in which case you can rewind all the way to the beginning of the recording n5 if you are watching tv behind real time and want to change the channel for a few minutes when you come back to the show you were watching it ll resume at real time and you ca n t rewind so you ll have missed however much time you were behind n6 the season pass function is supposed to record the selected show no matter what time it plays and no matter what channel i got a season pass for spin city but i had to set 2 season passes one for channel 13 and the other for channel 7 in order for it to work correctly n7 the thumbs up down system does n t work very well for some reason i end up with more fresh prince of bel air 3 thumbs up than spin city which i have a season pass for also my tivo likes to record practically every movie on sundance even though i give every single one of those movies 3 thumbs down n8 since the tivo box is always on there s no way for it to tell if you re actually there watching tv so in the middle of a show a message will pop up asking to change the channel so that it can record a tivo suggestion sometimes this is a hassle to find the remote and select cancel recording and stay on this channel also if you re listening to the tv but not actually watching it you may miss the pop up message in which case it will automatically change the channel and start recording this means that you have to cancel the recording and then switch back to the channel you were on therefore missing part of the show you were listening to n9 sometimes you ll be watching a show which is not being recorded and something really spectacular or funny will happen you would think that you could rewind and then hit record so that you could show it to somebody later but when you hit record it ll start recording from live tv to the end of the show this is also the same problem if you have live tv paused let s say the phone rings so you pause the show you re watching you realize that you re going to be on the phone for longer than 30 mins so you hit record when you go back to watch the show you ll find that it did n t record from the point it was paused at but rather the point of live tv when you hit record n10 shows are recorded based on the tivo programming guide which is downloaded over your phone line this means that many times you will miss the intro or last joke of a recorded show or if a game goes into overtime yep that s right you miss the whole overtime of course you can always record manually by setting a time period but that s kind of a hassle nto sum it up imagine this you invite a friend over and you begin demonstrating your tivo system your friend says do this do that well you can be sure that with the majority of those things you ll have to reply it ca n t do that nif you want something that records shows easily and at good quality and you do n t mind blowing 400 dollars plus the cost of tivo service 10 bucks a month then tivo is for you if you re looking for a really cool gadget that has complete control over tv save your money because you re going to be disappointed
1;42;99;0.89133710031298;i bought the tivo machine with the thought that it would be a fun toy another gadget to play with as it turns out it has become a need rather than just a want we do n t use our vcr anymore to record programs or movies from our tv tivo has taken its place we still use the vcr for playing movies we rent in tape form but for taping shows that broadcast during hours we are not home tivo has become our tv library it is very easy to use you program it with the remote to record what you want you can then bring up a screen with the remote which lists all the shows that have been recorded and you click on the show you want no rewinding tape and waiting and trying to find the spot where that show starts and this show ends on your videotape you just click on the show from the list tivo brings up like you would for bringing up a file from your computer tivo also gives you a complete tv guide with descriptions of shows it also is great for watching live tv shows if you want to take a break from watching a show that is being broadcast live you have to go to the bathroom or one of the kids is crying or someone calls or comes to your door or whatever tivo will allow you to record the show you are watching live with a click of the remote and you can come back a half hour later and begin watching the show from where you left off this machine does so many things that we have gotten used to using that i believe eventually everyone will have one as another part of the tv accessories i am sure this machine service will become part of the tv internet telephone combination being established one complaint is the remote for those that have a cable box is a little slower than the remote you are given by the cable companies otherwise tivo is a major thumbs up and something you will enjoy immensely i do n t have time to watch a lot of tv with three kids and a busy schedule but when i do i want to be able to watch what i want rather than what is being put out by the different broadcasters and tivo makes it really easy to paly the shows i want when i have the time devices like this that save us time or make our free time more enjoyable are worth their weight in gold
2;57;22;0.8873816206958132;i hesitated before buying a tivo because i was n t sure if it was the best option for me now i ca n t believe that i ever lived without it i ve only had it for a month but now whenever i watch tv somewhere without tivo i get so frustrated because i ca n t pause rewind have an instant replay etc i ca n t imagine living without the tivo i hardly ever use my vcr anymore nsetting up the tivo is not as easy as they make it out to be if you have cable box you may have to spend countless hours fiddling around behind your tv before you can get the tivo to work because it s meant to work with either direct tv or a satellite nevertheless it does work with almost all tvs and set ups and after you first get it all set up it s effortless to use the interactive menu is intuitive and easy to use so you ll be setting up season passes to record your favorite shows as soon as you start you can search for shows to record by time channel name or genre and you can get a season pass in order to record the show whenever it s on ni love always having a selection of shows i like ready for me to watch instead of having to channel surf endlessly to find something though there may not be a full 30 hours of recording time on the tivo 30 hours is only with basic sub par quality picture and best quality you can only record 9 hours i still find that i always have extra room left over to record my favorite shows i ve actually found that i do n t watch more tv now that i have the tivo i just watch tv shows that i actually like at times when i am available i get more homework done now no joke if there is extra room available the tivo actually records tv shows that it thinks that you would like since you are able to rate tv shows and movies it can choose similar ones that you might enjoy for example if you give friends 3 thumbs up it may record seinfeld for you if you have extra room if you do n t want the shows it it records you can simply delete them or give them a thumbs down rating the more shows you rate the better tivo understands your personal tastes the only thing i wish it could do is record on one channel while i watch another but it is understandable that it can not also tivo comes up with updates now and again to improve on its features so if something is n t perfect now it may be improved in the future for example some reviewers complained that while recording sports tivo would fail to record if the game went into overtime but now tivo has a feature which lets you cushion your recordings by however much time you want to ensure that you do n t miss anything none of the best features by far is a the live tv guide if you just press the live tv guide button while watching tv a menu pops up on top of the screen giving the name of the show or movie a brief plot summary who the actors are when it started when it ends and what s on after it watching tv was never so easy whenever i show my friends how tivo works they are amazed by how we can pause go get a drink or go to the bathroom then come back and fast forward through all the commercials you ll also never have to say wait what happened i missed it because you can simply rewind backwards in the program and watch it again ni know that i am gushing about this but tivo seriosly has changed the way i watch tv as many other reviewers have said tivo lets you control your tv not the other way around i think that i ll be using it for a long long time from now and i have no regrets about buying it
3;30;32;0.880466861430986;anyone that is thinking of purchasing a tivo unit from phillips or sony should completely ignore the review submitted by keithki he apparently has no idea how to use his tivo unit or did extremely poor research prior to purchasing it i wold like to answer each of his points nand now for the drawbacks of tivo which far surpasses the good things n1 unless you have a newer tv with 2 video inputs you ca n t record one show while viewing another ncorrect and you ca n t do it with a vcr either no where does tivo make the claim that you can record one show while watching another what you can do is watch a recorded show while another one is recorded can a vcr do that no n2 you can only rewind live tv back to the point where you changed the channel this means that if you change the channel to leno and just barely miss the punchline too bad you ca n t rewind nobviously the unit can only buffer the last 30 minutes of the channel you have been watching if you expected it to buffer every channel you have on the off chance you might channel surf over to it you made another huge mistake during your research n3 you can only pause for a max of 30 mins nwell if you are pausing for 30 minutes perhaps you should be recording it instead n4 you can only rewind to a max of 30 mins unless the show is being recorded in which case you can rewind all the way to the beginning of the recording nagain you clearly have no idea how this unit operates it buffers the last 30 minutes of the channel you are watching what you stated is true whats the problem n5 if you are watching tv behind real time and want to change the channel for a few minutes when you come back to the show you were watching it ll resume at real time and you ca n t rewind so you ll have missed however much time you were behind nsee response to 2 and add you have no idea how this unit works n6 the season pass function is supposed to record the selected show no matter what time it plays and no matter what channel i got a season pass for spin city but i had to set 2 season passes one for channel 13 and the other for channel 7 in order for it to work correctly nthe new version of the tivo software offers much broader control over the season pass and whats the problem with two season passes when you select the season pass it clearly states which channel it will be recording from the new software allows for recording only first run episodes or all reruns as well you can prioritize season passes should there be a conflict between several shows so tivo will record the higher priority show n7 the thumbs up down system does n t work very well for some reason i end up with more fresh prince of bel air 3 thumbs up than spin city which i have a season pass for also my tivo likes to record practically every movie on sundance even though i give every single one of those movies 3 thumbs down nit takes several weeks for the thumbs up down feature to begin to accurately predict what you may like dislike you can also tell the unit not to record the suggestions but rather review a list of them and decide which ones you want to record and delete the ones you do n t want n8 since the tivo box is always on there s no way for it to tell if you re actually there watching tv so in the middle of a show a message will pop up asking to change the channel so that it can record a tivo suggestion sometimes this is a hassle to find the remote and select cancel recording and stay on this channel also if you re listening to the tv but not actually watching it you may miss the pop up message in which case it will automatically change the channel and start recording this means that you have to cancel the recording and then switch back to the channel you were on therefore missing part of the show you were listening to nagain turn off the suggestions from being recorded you really need to learn how to use the tivo unit n9 sometimes you ll be watching a show which is not being recorded and something really spectacular or funny will happen you would think that you could rewind and then hit record so that you could show it to somebody later but when you hit record it ll start recording from live tv to the end of the show this is also the same problem if you have live tv paused let s say the phone rings so you pause the show you re watching you realize that you re going to be on the phone for longer than 30 mins so you hit record when you go back to watch the show you ll find that it did n t record from the point it was paused at but rather the point of live tv when you hit record nthe new version of the software allows you to record the buffer and begin recording the show problem solved n10 shows are recorded based on the tivo programming guide which is downloaded over your phone line this means that many times you will miss the intro or last joke of a recorded show or if a game goes into overtime yep that s right you miss the whole overtime of course you can always record manually by setting a time period but that s kind of a hassle nthe new version of the tivo software allows you to pad the recording time in order to capture shows that may run over like survivor running over by 2 3 minutes of course nobody can predict if a sporting event will go into overtime so you re going to miss the overtime with a vcr or a tivo ni am extremely happy with my sony tivo it performs as advertised and makes watching tv a new experience if you just take the time to fully learn what tivo can do you will see that it far surpasses both vcrs and its own advertising ni hope this clears up the inaccuracies in the review posted by keithki nbruce
4;13;75;0.8785317308619065;some thought hdtv would change the world of tv but promise that is still left unfulfilled i would argue that personalized tv not higher definition is really what will change the tv medium in the future why waste time being forced to watch what you have no interest in do you really want to see that ad with the guy going through the car wash in a tent in higher definition or would you rather just skip it altogether nlike the replay tivo is one of the first electronic devices that delivers on this promise this is unlike any other component you have in your av system and is lightyears of different from a cable satellite control box since this is an actual computer running a real os with a real hard drive what does this mean to you high quality recording recommendations personalized settings automatically receive new features nthe configuration of the tivo box was incredibly straightforward and easy so that even the most non technical person you know can set it up the only problem with setting up the tivo is figuring out how to wire it up to all your other components for the average consumer this wo n t be a problem since their setup is relatively standard and covered in the manual however if you have tv vcr cable box dvd av receiver etc you will need to spend some time thinking about how to best run the wires nthe initial configuration takes about 20 minutes of your time and then it dials into tivo to get your channel lineup and program guide this is a short one time call that is followed by a 1 to 2 hour initial indexing of all the information to make it easy for you to find things the time it takes to index is based upon the number of channels your tv cable satellite system supports so if you actually only use a small set of channels then the indexing is much faster ni almost never watch live tv anymore as i usually just pick something that the tivo has already recorded at best quality there is no visual degredation of the signal by running the signal through the box even when watching live tv the benefits of pausing rewinding etc are just too good to miss out on if you are trying to watch live tv you do pay a penalty of being about a second behind the actual broadcast but who really cares about such a small time delay nthe tivo will automatically record shows it thinks you will like i have had mixed success with this it has recorded some interesting shows for me it has also recorded shows that it previously recorded and i explicitly deleted of course you can always negatively rate the show instead of deleting so it does n t show up again but how that impacts your overall tivo recommendations is unknown nthere is no guide that comes with the tivo that tells you how to make optimal use of the thumbs up thumbs down feature you can give a show up to 3 thumbs up or thumbs down so you do have flexability but it is unclear what the difference between 1 thumbs up and two thumbs up are the recommendations can certainly be improved but i think with more people using the service that these will only get better over time nanother downside is that the interaction with digital cable box is less than satisfactory you change channels on tivo and not all ir commands are received by cable box this is mostly not tivo s fault since the cable box does not properly queue ir commands however tivo should allow you to specify ir delays in some sort of advanced menu non the good side all the problems i have with the tivo can be corrected by them through future software releases the tivo company has been great at responding to customers and focusing on solving the problems that gives the biggest win to the consumer nall in all this is a really solid product for being an early entrant into personal tv technology even at this point i do n t think i could live without the tivo even though i do n t watch much tv is has saved me significant time since i can fast forward through anything that is slow boring or advertistements and i do n t have to worry about rushing home to watch shows in real time
5;95;29;0.8735831701701132;i think some of the folks writing reviews of this product do not completely understand it sure it s nice to be able to pause live tv but that s not what i love the most about tivo ni used to tape a lot of shows on my vcr my wife was always complaining because i never got around to labeling the tapes and looking for a show i wanted to see would take a while once i found the tape i d have to search it to find the show i had tapes piling up alongside the deck it was a mess nnow that i have tivo watching tv is more fun than ever all the shows i want to watch are right there labeled and dated the picture quality even at medium simply blows away vhs i watch whatever i want whenever i want to nthe user interface is magnificent you can pad start times and end times i always start er a minute early i have wishlists with which i can have tivo look for an actor director or keyword and then it will tape the show automatically and it has an amazing feature that lets me rate any show i see with thumbs up or thumbs down up to 3 of either and it learns from my ratings what i like to watch and what i do n t like to watch with suggestions enabled you can turn them off if you do n t want them but this is a great feature tivo will seek out and record shows it thinks you might like nas a result of having tivo i get so much more out of my television experience than i ever did before it s like there s always something great on that i want to see i hardly ever watch live tv any more ni saw a review here where the reviewer was concentrating on tivo s limitations sure it has some limitations and by the way that reviewer was off the mark on several things he wrote for example you can pad start and end times if you expect a show to run overtime and while it does n t have a 30 second skip it has a wonderful fast play forward and reverse that makes it a breeze to zip through commercials but as far as i m concerned it offers so much more than a vcr that it defies comparison my wife was never comfortable with our vcr she could n t program it and had trouble finding recorded shows she loves our tivo and operates it easily nvery few products these days can claim to be life changing tivo has completely changed the way we watch television and we ca n t imagine life without it it s been a solid and reliable piece of equipment as well if you do a lot of taping or if you just like to watch television i heartily recommend this item
6;16;41;0.8625445251603739;i am an early adopter of tivo and it has completely changed the way that i watch tv i m glad that people are finally catching on to what i ve been saying for over a year which is tivo is the coolest thing ever the main thing that i hear from people when i try to explain the benefits of owning a tivo is but i have a vcr why would i want this i have put together a brief list of the benefits of owning a tivo for you non believers n1 i too own a vcr and with all the good intentions in the world of taping programs that i wanted to see i never did n2 are n t you sick of missing your favorite tv shows with tivo you will never miss your favorite shows again in addition my little tivo friend may help you find new favorite shows n3 do n t you hate commercials as much as the next guy with tivo you will never be forced to sit through another minute of those crappy commercials you will not even know what people are talking about as they discuss the new bud commercial you ll merely shake your head and know that those poor unfortunate souls do n t have a tivo at home n4 do n t you ever have to go to the bathroom in the middle of watching something i wo n t elaborate on that one but would n t it be nice to pause your tv to jump up and answer the phone grab a snack etc without having to worry about what you re going to miss n5 you ll rent less movies which also means that you ll save more money forget renting just pay for the premium channels that you were always to cheap to pay for before because you figured that you d never watch that many movies now you can watch them all nso to sum up my little tivo review i have to say that you will completely streamline the way you watch tv when you get a tivo stop torturing yourself with the network s schedule that does n t fit your schedule and make up your own with tivo there is always something good on what you want to watch
7;89;27;0.8404851347561347;i knew from the moment i heard of the concept of tivo and replay i wanted one but i had to wait until the price came down and the recording space went up i bought a 30 hour phillips tivo last august and i absolutely love it the subscription was a concern to me but if you buy the lifetime subscription it costs no more than a replay which has the subscription fee built in the selling price and if you decide to sell your tivo with a lifetime subscription you would most likely recoup a most of that subscription fee yes setup takes some time but not your time after a few minutes of making your choices during the setup it takes awhile to download your programming and get it setup but you can go to dinner or sleep while that happens the modem is a weak point which can be solved by unplugging the phone line during violent storms and using a phone line surge protector the 1 3 version software was a little slow compared to the 2 01 i have now the 2 01 version has made the unit more more responsive it is absolutely wonderful to watch shows at your own convenience tivo finds shows i have enjoyed which i never would have found on my own i love seeing what tivo has figured out i would like to watch i have my tivo programmed to go through the vcr so if i do want to watch something other than what i am recording all i have to do is turn the vcr off and watch tv regularly even though it is hard to do without the ability to pause or speed through commercials i love pausing i love recording something while watching something else i have already recorded i love whizzing through commercials i love backing up tivo to hear what someone on tv said that i did n t quite catch i love the hard drive recording and menus no comparison to a vcr i love setting up season passes with priorities set and having the tv change channels all by itself for the week really could make one into a real couch potato finally i love my phillips remote it is the most intuitive ergonomic remote control i have ever known i figured out what buttons to push in the dark the first night just feels good in the hand i have to have a stand alone model for i have to watch ota channels since network channels are not available on my directv receiver in southern missouri i am sure i will get a 60 hour sa model when the price drops some more so i can tivo two channels at the same time i definitely am a member of tivolution
8;71;38;0.8169518942928756;i received a great birthday present in 2000 the tivo i can honestly say it s changed the way i view television however corny their ad slogan is ni set up my tivo in late september and i have n t looked back since the setup took an extraordinary amount of time at least 2 hours but once i got rolling everything else was pretty easy i ca n t tell you how much i enjoy taking my time to do things instead of rushing home to catch my favorite program i do n t have to worry because tivo s got me covered nnot only has the tivo recorded programs i like to watch but it recommends show that i might watch though the use of the thumbs up thumbs down recommendations i give to specific shows and i can say that some of the recommendations they ve given have hit the nail right on the head the recommendations can be a little weird though i mean i m a guy who likes the simpsons but does that mean i ll like rugrats as well nthis is not a perfect unit though drawbacks include missing recording cues although not entirely tivo s fault but you d think some networks would get on the ball here and standardize when they start and stop a show you would n t know how many times i ve said oh the recording started late again or why did you cut off the ending also the unit in a quiet room can be a little noisy when i m watching a show late at night i can hear the unit s hard drive churning maybe i m nitpicking but i thought you would like to know nanother drawback is the inability to totally skip over commercials you can fast forward sure you have to be good at timing the fast forward right so that when you hit play you ll catch the show just after commercial nyes the product has drawbacks but i can look past that for now and say that this product is amazing in a couple of years my tune might change but for now make mine tivo
9;26;76;0.8143600367174205;just to begin by replying to a previous review the fact that tivo is on all the time is good this prevents wear on the system and the hard drive think about your computer all the experts advise leaving it on instead constantly turning it on and off i bought my tivo recently and amazon just credited me with the price difference since the tivo just dropped in price dramatically the tivo set up was long but simple the 800 number was assuring since i do n t live in a major metropolitan area i got the lifetime subscription and the 100 direct tv rebate so i wound up paying a lot less for my unit overall than for the competition which i checked out there are no long distance calls with tivo i do n t save anytime during the day i still watch 5 hours of tv every night but now it s quality tv not just channel surfing i can also watch more good tv in less time you can quickly scan through commercials like a vcr but you can do it while recording the item if you start watching a show about 6 to 7 minutes in while recording it on your tivo you can skip the commercials while watching and catch up to live tv without missing anything it s really easy too and now the same price as a good vcr but it s much better i m the envy of all my techie friend end
10;67;70;0.80954935429889;yes i agree with the others this product is indeed a must have and to use that well worn phrase it really will change the way you watch tv i m totally thrilled with mine i bought the 30 hour model and just love it the set up can be tricky but not really because the manual guides you through the process completely the guide is extremely well thought out and presented in a clear fashion plus they ve included lots of accessory hardware cables etc to get you going i have a digital broadband signal coming into my house so even at the basic quality 30 hrs the recordings i get are clearer than sp on my vcr really i love pausing live tv and the best thing is having something ready to watch whenever i want tivo s suggestions are really good i ve only had to thumbs down a couple of things this product is going to catch on you have to try it for yourself to believe it it s well worth the money now there s something on i like all the time get it
11;65;73;0.7997821006208486;wow i ve had my philips tivo unit since december my christmas present to myself and i have been quite impressed with it and think this is the greatest entertainment device since directv ni have the 30 hour unit which gives me a lot of room of programming i generally record movies under the best quality setting and other programming under the other settings nthe other features i like are the season pass the ability to pause live television and video quality and sound the season pass feature enables me to never ever have to worry about having a tape in the vcr to tape programming or setting the timer in my life i do n t have the time to spend worrying about videotape nbeing a movie buff and a sports nut the pause button comes in handy frequently when watching live television one thing that i ve done while watching sports is rewinding back to catch some of the action thus avoiding commericals nand finally the video sound quality is outstanding i have my tivo hooked up to my home theatre system and the sound quality is not altered nthe drawbacks of the tivo unit are trivial in my eyes but i will point them out for the benefit of others who have directv if you have a directv system or other dss you will find that it will take quite some time for the unit to index the channels programs when initially setting it up patience is necessary second do not ever turn off your dss receiver this will cause the tivo unit to freeze the next time you attempt to use it ni have no regrets with my decision to purchase the philips tivo unit and highly recommend it you can finally control television instead of it controlling you
12;45;8;0.7673021058983819;i was an early adopter of tivo and paid price 0 for it 2 years ago i immediately recognized its potential based soley on what i read let me tell you i have not regretted for one second paying that much that one extra year i got out of it before prices fell was worth every penny i hope someone considering buying tivo will overlook some of the bad press and instead focus on the overwhelming positive comments even after two years tivo has never disappointed me and continues to amaze me i ve heard skeptics say they could do the same thing with their computer unlikely the proprietary software tivo uses can not be copied onto a pc and the software is everything the software is phenomenal every time tivo records a show i did n t ask it to based soley on what it correctly thinks i might like i think how magnificent this thing is and it gets better all the time the software developers at tivo are constantly improving it sending updates over the modem there are features now i ca n t live without that were n t there when i bought it try doing that with a vcr or dvd player unfortunately words can simply do no justice to this miracle of a box called tivo only demonstrations seem to be the ultimate convincer i ve personally convinced 10 others to buy tivo through demonstrations those that were n t convinced never saw a live demonstration they just could n t get their minds around the concept i guess but for those of you on this sight you ve already gotten over the biggest hurdle so good luck to you and good ridance to channel surfing forever
13;102;50;0.7511579734747043;you ll never regret buying this it s easy to use my wife and kids had no trouble from the first day it records shows you want to watch in much better than vcr quality with no need to fumble for tapes or worry about switching cable box channels with a few clicks tivo will automatically record ever episode of shows like survivor the sopranos or the west wing without you needing to do anything else you watch what you want whenever you want to watch it tivo lets you pause live tv while the phone rings and pick up where you left off it lets you rewind to see a great play during a ball game and then catch up during commercials the remote is the best designed remote i ve ever owned ntivo is great buy this you wo n t be disappointed
14;20;58;0.7440710947507577;in the past twenty years i ve purchased thousands of dollars worth of a v and pc equipment at 399 plus 10 per month for the programming tivo is my favorite ok if i want to spend hours every week programming my vcr of which i own five i can record all my favorite shows but why bother when tivo does a much better job virtually automatically since i purchased tivo in april i have n t recorded anything on the vcr s i still use them occasionally to play a rental movie not available on dvd for those of you that may complain about the 10 month or 200 one time charge for the programming data service i would suggest that this is a minor cost compared to what you are probably paying for cable or direct tv and i would submit that the tivo service will greatly enhance your ability to utilize and manage the 50 to 250 channels that are available with cable or satellite ndo i watch alot more tv than i did before not really but now i always have something to watch that i m interested in rather than just watching what happens to be currently broadcasted ndid i consider replay yes also a nice product but for my needs tivo is better will the price drop by christmas probably but at 399 why wait enjoy it today
15;100;45;0.7378984151453608;i found tivo to be everything i had hoped for i have cable and dish network and the picture is perfect as far as i can see it takes about 4 hrs todo the complete setup but it is well worth it it has changed the way i watch tv i now only watch what i have told tivo to record i hardly ever watch live tv the tech support you get if you have any problems is great the feature i like the best are the season pass which is when you tell tivo to record a show anytime it is showing i also like the pause button when i do watch live tv i find tivo to be the best video toy i have bought to date i bought the 30 hr tivo i will never be able to watch everything that it records i do not surf the channels anymore and i never have to watch any commicials anymore it has a lot of additional features but i would typing here forever i found tivo to be worth much more than i paid for it
16;72;15;0.7173432910946195;i absolutely loved my tivo it was great until the modem stopped working needless to say i spent a loooong time on the phone with customer service i found out then that after i gave them 99 and paid for the shipping they could fix it so i thought it came back yesterday i hooked it up and sure enough the modem works now i have a new problem it freezes up during the set up procedure i have n t called customer service yet if you really want one of these i would recomend that you pay for the tivo service on monthly basis for a year or so until your reasonably sure it wo n t die or do n t pay for it at all and use your recorder like a regular vcr by manually setting the time and date of shows most of all read the negative reviews for some reason i did n t and now i m paying for it
17;34;44;0.7126963706286682;just wanted to put in my two cents about the reviews here that mention poor picture quality i read these reviews before i bought the unit and insisted that i be able to see it in action before buying it i found that the poor picture quality seems to only come through when the signal is sent through the tv tuner channel 3 or 4 using the direct line in to the tv produced a clear sharp picture i feel this is important to keep in mind for videophiles like me who want to get our money s worth out of the video products we buy nthe tivo concept is great now that the unit has learned my preferences i ca n t wait to get home from work each evening to see what it s recorded for me i find myself watching less and less live tv since tivo has recorded the shows i want to watch i have both cable and dss so there s lots to choose from it s nice not to have to weed through it all
18;96;12;0.6243821209037984;great product that makes the vcr a thing of the past once you have one you ll never be able to live without it best feature is the simple pause with five month old twins being able to pause the tv and deal with baby issues is very nice the recording of shows is very simple no setting time as a vcr does but instead select the show by name and the tivo will record the show even if the show moves to another time slot had mine for almost a year now and have had no troubles
19;63;51;0.6162973766123068;are you like me and tired of watching 20 minutes of commercials every hour then you will love this product how valuable is your time how much time do you waste watching commercials if you could cut that out what could you do with that extra time nhit pause and whatever you are watching is digitally recorded go make a sandwich and pick up where you left off jump ahead of commercials nthis unit is smart want instant replay it s got it want to preselect programs to watch it can want to give a program thumbs down and have it remember you do n t like it it can want 30 hours of record capabilty it has it nbuy this recorder you will never regret it it will change the way you watch tv it makes vcr s look prehistoric

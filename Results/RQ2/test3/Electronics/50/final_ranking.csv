0;11;45;0.7726139853762181;i have a canon powershot s100 which came with an 8mb card that could store a measly 16 photos at the default resolution this card can store 220 i m fairly new to this tecnology and figured that the bigger the card the slower it would be to shoot browse format etc the card formatted in a flash pardon the pun and it just whizzes along when i take pictures forget all the other cards and sizes go for the gusto and get the full 128 mb
1;41;33;0.7471060877233406;if you can get only one add on for your digital camera let it be this one ni took my kodak digital camera decked out with this 128mb compactflash card on a 6 week road trip i used the middle quality setting for the pictures and managed to take over 130 photos the equivalent of 5 6 24 shot rolls of film filling not anywhere close to half the card at that setting the card will store over 300 photos ni m not a digital photography technoid by any stretch of the imagination i just like capturing memories of the places i go and the things i see having the extra memory afforded by this little card meant that i could relax and not worry about running out of space for all my photos ntransferring the photos to my laptop was a piece of cake and took very little time partially a function of the card ni highly recommend this as the first accessory upgrade you purchase for your camera
2;8;19;0.7454747410093471;i m a happy owner of nikon s new addition in the advanced amateur professional digital camera market the d100 the camera received tremendous pre release publicity and i can say from first hand knowledge that the praise is justified however the d100 does n t arrive with any means of image storage so i ran down to the closest electronics store and purchaged a 128 mb cf memory card for about the card was rated as 4x speed it worked great with no complaints however last week i searched amazon com and found a very high quality viking 128 mb compact flash card at and free shipping the viking is a much higher quality card that the one previously purchased and less money and no shipping cost a real bargain in my book are you an ebay shopper then you know that the viking card is selling for more on ebay than amazon s price
3;27;14;0.7184516468217041;i bought this card for a nikon coolpix 2500 i had heard that some cards work great in some cameras and not so great in others when i installed the card the nikon coolpix logo appeared and just stayed and looked at me i was dismayed but all of a sudden the screen went blank and the logo appeared again then the screen came alive and i formated the card from that time on it worked perfectly and is very fast i guess the camera or the card had to get used to each other all in all a great card
4;18;20;0.7166722651917845;this is a great card i bought this with my s200 elph because i knew the included 8meg card would n t be large enough it s transfer speed does talk a second or two but its not long enough to make me irratated also the two sides of the card are very different so i can tell which side goes up the card also looks very cool very shiny before you buy this one however make sure that its the kind of card your camera mp3 player etc takes so you do n t end up like the reviewer who said your mp3 player would need to be the size of a boombox to use this card another plus is that this is the cheapest 128meg card i have seen on amazon com for a great value for a 128meg card definately buy this one
5;2;6;0.7098549771705088;if you ve had a 2 mega pixel or above camera for more than a few days then you ve realized that an 8 or 16 mb memory card is not going to cut it in my opinion you really have two good alternatives 1 a good capacity compactflash memory card like this viking card or 2 one of the microdrives nthis 128 mb viking memory card is a good value on a cost per megabyte basis i have not seen a better compactflash value anywhere and it offers more peace of mind since it has no moving parts however the microdrive does cost less per megabyte in fact for the same cost you ll get 340 mb of storage vs 128 mb with the viking although you ll have a miniature hard drive to worry about in terms of potential lost photos ni ve got both but i ll only use the microdrive on long trips where i know i ll need the storage space and then i mn exceptionally careful with it most people will be happier going the compactflash route in which case this viking card is the best value and very reliable i m very pleased with it go ahead it s pretty much an essential accessory
6;49;41;0.6898262958956449;the viking 128 mb card represents an excellent value today as compact flash prices finally begin to come down a bit i use the 1 per mb rule as a basis for what represents a good value at today s prices june 2001 the viking card comes in well below that figure and i know of no card by viking or any other manufacturer with a lower dollar per mb price nhaving said that the only complaint is the viking card does seem a bit slower to write to than say a lexar card but unless you are in a big hurry or need to take rapid sequences of shots this is not a big complaint i suspect it s as fast as most cards today aside from lexar nnow if i was only allowed to buy more than one oh well i guess they want to keep people from harding them at this price
7;13;17;0.672225533033828;i bought this card because the camera manufacturers are pretty darn chincy at furnishing a reasonably sized cf card knowing what they furnish will only hold a few pics i bought this card because it ranks amount the top three cards or so as far as write and read speed this has proved to be true i use it in my kodak and minolta cameras and also my epson 785 printer do n t be afraid to buy this i already did all the leg work also i think probably this is one item that amazon is least expensive on so you are getting good value
8;20;13;0.6486617139190669;i have a 2 megapixel canon elph and own two other cf cards sandisk 64mb and fuji64mb reason i got another cf card was the price as of feb 2003 was the lowest i ve seen ever and i did abit more research than before check dpreview com they have a section of cf card ratings and this particular card did very good as far as speed and reliability ni did my own amateur testing and noticed slight differences the viking and sandisk cards were abit faster in taking multiple shots but this is a matter of miliseconds reliability i have had the two other cards for about 6 months and have not had a problem with data loss of any kind on my 2 megapixel camera the viking 128mb cf card shot about 360 400 images high quality depending on image size each image can be a different file size depending on the information each one requires nso i would just stick with a big name like viking or sandisk and you really cant go wrong
9;17;18;0.622226072547695;i just recently purchased a canon digital camera and i bought this at the same time i can take so many pictures with my new camera if i would not have purchased this i would have been disappointed with the fact that i can only take 15 pictures with my 8 mb card with this card on the best resolution i can take 250 pictures you definitely need something like this if you really want to take advantage of your digital camera
10;40;5;0.5563476053923715;the 8mb memory that came with my 1 megapixel kodak dc240 justdid n t cut the mustard when i saw the viking 128mb memory i jumped at the chance now all i need is a battery charger that accommodates european outlets and i m all set for my european vacations think of it no more film processing charges

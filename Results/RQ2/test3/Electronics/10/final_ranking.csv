0;5;6;0.6032424640401414;great gps you can add the dimensions of your rv and it will take you to big enough roads the only thing i did n t like is that it did n t know about a freeway closeup we knew about it since it s closed for a while now due to repairs it kept telling us to use it and only when we were passed it it showed us the new way it kept recalculating the route though which i liked it is very nice to look at it and know what the speed limit is and what your speed is at any given point very clear to see even if it s on the the co pilots side i tried using my sunglasses and all of the sudden it went dark i could n t see anything on it i asked my wife if something happened to it and she said no it s working fine i took my sunglasses off and sure enough it was working fine i am guessing the polarized lenses wo n t allow you to see it my sunglasses are maui jim and they are polarized i do n t know enough about sunglasses to guess something else overall a great gps for rvers

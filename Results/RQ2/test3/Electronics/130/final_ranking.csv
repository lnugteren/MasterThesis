0;3;125;0.9168221546750568;the sonos playbar may seem expensive for a sound bar but only if you look at it as just a sound bar really it does much more and i ll get to that but first as a sound bar it works well and is pretty easy to set up plug in the power cord and an optical cable from your tv and that s it as far as audio connections go to fully configure the unit and get it to work with your existing remote you ll need to install the sonos controller app free which runs on pc mac android and ios devices in the app is where you add a device add the playbar to your home network and establish the sonos network in your home n nif you do n t have any other sonos products in your home already you ll need to either connect the playbar to a network router or network switch with a standard network cable one of which is included in the box or purchase a nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href sonos bridge dp b000x1ts54 ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf8 sonos bridge a nbsp which plugs into your network router and allows the playbar to connect to your network wirelessly the reason you need this is that the sonos mesh network is actually separate from your existing wifi network it makes its own which is great because it does n t interfere with regular wifi traffic and vice versa this means fewer dropouts in your music n nupdate in 2014 sonos rolled out a software update that allows all existing sonos speakers to work without the need for a bridge so as long as you have a solid wifi connection in your home any sonos speaker even a play 1 or the playbar can play music wirelessly n nadding the playbar to your sonos system requires pushing a couple of buttons on the unit itself when prompted by the app and then telling the sonos app what room it s in then you can program the playbar to respond to your existing tv remote or cable satellite remote an on screen wizard walks you through this tip if you ca n t get the playbar to recognize commands from your dish or directv or cable remote then you may need to first set up that other remote to control your tv most set top box remotes come without any tv remote commands pre programmed into them so if you try to program it into the playbar you wo n t get very far this was a problem for me with a dish remote until i first programmed the dish remote to control my tv then the playbar was able to see the remote and respond to it for volume control once you do that you can do the basic operation of the bar volume up down using your existing remote control and you wo n t have to refer back to the app the playbar s optical digital input automatically gets preference so if you re listening to music on it then turn on the tv it will automatically switch over to tv sound n nin terms of sound quality the playbar blows away any tv speakers i ve heard the thinner a tv gets the worse it sounds speakers need some room to resonate and the playbar has that while flat panel tvs do not movie dialog male or female vocals have a nice transparency on the playbar treble and high frequencies are detailed without being harsh and bass response is tight if not prodigious there s only so much bass you can get from a small cabinet n nthe playbar uses some acoustic and electronic techniques to expand the sound stage so it sounds wider than it is i noticed this on a few songs and movies but it was particularly obvious on rush 2112 and on the moody blues wildest dreams the instruments appeared to be located outside the edges of the bar while vocals were locked in place in the center there are a total of 9 speakers on the playbar each with its own amplifier and sonos uses this entire array to create a coherent soundstage n nbut as good as it sounds the playbar is n t perfect bass is on the lighter side and if you use the eq controls in the sonos app to boost the bass it gets a bit boomy also the playbar can get a bit congested and harsh when pushed to higher sound levels though this is definitely better if you add the sonos sub with the sub the playbar can then allocate its amplification and drivers to the midrange and treble which are easier to drive without distortion also these sonic deficiencies are only evident when comparing the unit to a dedicated surround sound system n nbut there are two reasons why the playbar is unique and gets my recommendation a it s upgradeable to fully discrete and wireless 5 1 surround with the addition of the sonos sub and a pair of play 1 or play 3 speakers and b it s a sonos more on that later i tested the playbar on its own and then with the sub and play 3 rear speakers adding the sub and rear speakers was a simple as adding the initial playbar to the sonos network but there is a new option within the room set up that allows you to group the play 3s play 1s or a connect amp as surround speakers for the playbar in the same room the set up wizard asks a couple of questions about distance from listening position to the rear speakers and for the subwoofer some questions about the levels but that s about it n nwith the sub and play 3s added the system was able to reproduce discrete 5 1 channel dolby digital surround sound i confirmed this using a 5 1 channel test track from one of dolby s sampler discs as well as some movie clips and a couple of full length films the playbar does not decode dts but this may not be a show stopper for some as few tvs output or pass through dts the issue with this or any sound bar that uses the tv s digital output for sound is that most tvs will not pass through a dolby digital 5 1 signal from source through to tv output some sony tvs do it as well as some vizios and some lgs there may be others but most tvs will drop the signal down to 2 channel output at the fiberoptic digital out for this reason i would have liked to see a second digital input on the playbar as well as dts decoding this way you could use one input for the tv and the second input for a dvd or blu ray player to get discrete 5 1 sound from that i can understand why sonos chose this single input approach if there were an input function on the playbar to switch inputs chances are things could have gotten confusing for some users still for advanced users the second input and dts decoding would have been appreciated n nthere is a workaround to this issue not the dts decoding but the extra fiberoptic input if you re willing to sacrifice some simplicity you can buy a fiber optic digital audio switch box connect your devices to this plug its output into the playbar and then get discrete 5 1 surround from dolby digital content on a cable box streaming set top box dvd player or blu ray player there are several of these switches available on amazon including this nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href basic manual switch dp b000812qc6 ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf8 basic manual switch a and this nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href more advanced remote controlled switch dp b00g188z7a ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf8 more advanced remote controlled switch a there are many others available like this n nin any case the playbar does decode surround encoded 2 channel pcm or dolby digital sound which tvs do output and will give you a reasonable surround sound stage even from this material as long as there is rear channel information encoded into the content and if you do have a true 5 1 source like the streaming apps built into your tv netflix vudu amazon vod or your tv s built in atsc tuner then you will get even better sound with discrete 5 1 surround n nwatching a movie in full 5 1 dolby digital surround on the system is a vastly improved experience over the playbar alone bass is deep and extended without being bloated surround effects emanate from all around the room and overall dynamic range is enhanced as the playbar is able to concentrate all its power on the front three channels without having to worry about surround or low bass the only caveat adding the sub and play 3 rears brings the system cost from 700 to about 1 800 and that s a bit steep n nsonos the killer app for music n nin addition to being a sound bar the playbar is also an independent wireless sonos zone this means you can fire up the sonos app on your phone or tablet access your digital music collection stored on a pc or local network drive or in itunes on an iphone or ipad and play it back through the playbar you can also access a ton of different online music streaming services some of which are free and some of which require a subscription i was finding songs and discovering new artists on spotify accessing my local mp3 collection on my pc and streaming pandora radio stations just minutes after opening the box and the nice thing about sonos is that it manages music from these different services in a single playback queue so one song came from spotify then a couple from one of my ripped cds the next from spotify you get the idea n nfor those who say you can do that wireless music streaming stuff with airplay or an appletv etc i say poppycock yes airplay allows you to stream music from your phone tablet or computer wirelessly but to use apple tv you re limited to the apple ecosystem e g itunes and whichever apps apple chooses to enable sonos is more of an open platform with support for different file formats as well as all of the most popular music streaming apps and services also with appletv and virtually any other streaming media box you have to have the tv on and switched to the correct input in order to hear anything or see what s playing for music listening this just is n t convenient with the playbar everything is driven through the sonos app on your smart phone pc or tablet pick your music press play and you re good to go and when you want to switch back over to watching tv the playbar handles that for you automatically so the sound matches the picture n ni found myself listening to a lot more music with the playbar in the living room because it s not just easy but actually fun if you re feeling adventurous or home sick after a move you can also access any of thousands of streaming internet radio stations right within the app n nif you add on more sonos components play 3 play 5 etc throughout your home you can decide which room gets which music right from your smart phone pc or tablet it s an advanced multi room audio system without the cost of installation or the need to rip up your walls also with the playbar in the system and connected to your tv you can pipe that tv sound to any other sonos wireless zone in your home which was an unexpected bonus n nfor tv listening the playbar has some nice features which work standalone or with the full 5 1 system night mode compresses the dynamic range so you can hear whispered dialog and subtle surround effects without the loud parts of the movie being overpowering speech enhancement brings the dialog forward in the mix so you can make out what characters are saying even when there are other distractions you can use both at the same time or each feature independently i tested both and found that they did make subtle but noticeable improvements to dialog intelligibility and the night mode did equalize differences between soft and quiet points i found i could keep sherlock holmes a game of shadows at a reasonable volume level and i did n t need to leap for the remote when the explosions kicked in but for daytime movie viewing and for music i left these features turned off n nturn ons n n good sound overall considering size n simple connection set up and operation n nice looking unit n flexible installation n sonos app puts the world of music at your fingertips n nturn offs n n needs more bass n gets a bit congested at high volumes n could use a second fiberoptic input and dts support n limited by tv s ability to pass through 5 1 surround n a little pricey n nreviewing the playbar is a bit tricky as a pure sound bar it s a nice sounding simple solution that can plug and play with your existing tv and remote but again as a pure sound bar it s expensive and does n t offer the low bass extension of many more affordable sound bar subwoofer combos but unlike most sound bars the playbar is upgradeable find the bass a bit light add a sub want to experience discrete surround sound add a pair of play 1s as surrounds this is something most other sound bars simply can not do but what really sets the playbar apart from every other sound bar on the planet is that it s also a sonos wireless speaker with all the streaming musical goodness that the sonos platform has to offer you ll come for the enhanced sound from movies and tv but you ll stay for the music recommended n nupdate october 2013 the rear channels of a playbar 5 1 system can now be the new less expensive play 1 speakers or you can use your own speakers with the connect amp the play 3 is also still supported as a rear channel speaker for a playbar multi channel system n na more detailed review is available on big picture big sound dot com
1;1;120;0.8947249844611453;i m a huge sonos fan i own 3 play 5 s and a sub i d been wanting to replace my bulky 5 1 speaker system with a playbar since it was rumored all their products have incredible sound quality so i was optimistic about this set up n nset up is easy sound quality is good for the unit it s a nice product and looks great while being easy to operate although more reliant on the sonos application than i d prefer it s the typical awesomeness that you get with any sonos product n nwhen testing the playbar with a direct connection to a device e g apple tv and running it compared to my 5 speaker system through my receiver i was impressed with the quality sound was more spread out and filled the room better but dialog center was ultimately a bit shallow feeling if you turn on speech enhancement in the menu it helps out but something still feels slightly off it s something you re unlikely to notice unless you re actively comparing like i was but to the playbar s credit it was no slouch i had a few people compare with me and everyone picked the typical 5 1 setup for better sound but had positive things to say about the playbar mainly noting its shallow feel in certain rangers and with dialog as the main issues n nhere s the issue though sonos says they want you to use your tv as a hub all the inputs going to the tv and then optical audio out from the tv to the playbar great idea but the problem is that most tv s wo n t pass dolby digital dd 5 1 surround from hdmi to the digital optical audio if it s from the tv itself such as netflix on a smart tv or input directly from the coaxial cable it will pass 5 1 through the optical port but not from hdmi this is either required to be hdcp compliant or is a licensing cost issue not sure there are a few tv s that do this but they re few and far between and hard to verify n nso if you have multiple sources say an xbox 360 blu ray player apple tv etc there s no way for those sources to ever deliver 5 1 to the playbar as sonos intended assuming you add a sub and some play 3 s to the mix and you ca n t wire multiple inputs directly to the playbar because they have a single input for the sake of simplicity normally i m fine with this but in light of the limitation with hdmi optical pass through on tvs this became an oversight to me upon learning about the pass through issue you can solve this by finding a tv or receiver that does pass through dd 5 1 through the optical audio but you should n t have to alternatively you can use an optical audio switch which is fine most of the time but may not work with a blu ray player since playbar lacks dts support and are also limited on inputs but this does n t solve what to do for certain devices that do n t have an optical audio port e g most computers wii u etc n nin the end you re left with a system that is capable of producing much better sound especially if a sub and some play 3s are added that most everyone wo n t be able to hear and results in this not sounding as good as it costs and that s just a shame to me n npros n easy set up n sonos n decent sound from stereo source n ncons n single optical input only n no dts support n entire package is expensive for 5 1 or even 3 1 n nthe only scenario i can see this being a good thing is if you have a room where you want to add a sonos component and a soundbar to and you want to do it in a single package without caring about other components like for a den or a bedroom any other solution seems like there d be a better option n nultimately i m disappointed had sonos included multiple audio inputs or hdmi pass through or even better yet hdmi switching in place of a receiver then this could have been an amazing piece but the reliance on a single optical input being provided from the tv one which will down convert any hdmi source s audio to stereo sound in the name of simplicity just seems like a bad idea n nhad i known about the tv s not passing through audio i would n t have bought this my mistake honestly but it just makes it baffling as to why sonos did n t provide different input options as it stands i m returning it hopefully sonos will look in to making an hdmi hub option as an accessory n n update nthe landscape has changed in terms of tvs that do pass 5 1 through and it s better it s still difficult to determine precisely so i d suggest checking forums to see if your tv does in indeed pass 5 1 out my 2015 lg oled does not but i m under the impression the 2017 models do possibly the 2016 models for example that all said i think my points made above still stand most existing tvs do n t do this and it s still very hard to verify n nadditionally i d like to note the omission of another audio format dolby atmos sonos says they elected to omit this on the playbase the related product to this because so few things used it and they wanted to focus on streaming but the issue is this limits user choice vudu netflix and itunes support or will support dolby atmos there are likely more services that do as well n nthey have their very specific viewpoint of how people should use this product and with what 5 1 over optical in dd steaming services and that options are n t needed there are better products out there especially for the total money spent i m not saying there s no market for this or it s terrible if you have a tv that passes 5 1 and you do n t care about dts and dolby atmos it s a fine product and exactly the scenario that sonos has in mind but if you want options or do n t have a tv that will and you ll be limited to stereo look elsewhere then you can do better or cheaper it s just a shame that sonos continues to limit this product as when it works as they want it to it s great
2;14;95;0.8863620253573333;if you re like me you have probably scoured the internet looking for the best over all soundbar with the best value for the money something that will give you as close to a actual surround sound experience as possible but be aesthetically pleasing enough to keep the wife happy i can honestly say that the sonos playbar is it for me n ni recently purchased the playbar and have it connected to a blu ray xbox and cable box nwhile i do think a sub would make it sound even better i have to say that i am extremely happy with the quality the soundbar alone gives the sound quality is amazing nice clean detail in the audio with a great low end without a sub the speech enhancement feature is great for sports or content with a lot of dialogue and the bar programs to your existing remote perfectly the set up is cake and the size look is perfect for my entertainment stand n ni have owned a sonos play3 for over a year now and am totally sold on the way they perform i mean bluetooth is great but sonos is a far superior product to your average bluetooth speaker or soundbar quality content range expandability independent room control it s all there with sonos i knew that i wanted to incorporate this into my home theater system as well but i initially had some concerns with the playbar n nif you have done your research on this soundbar then you probably have heard of the complaint that it only has one optical input and makes you pass all of your audio through your t v when using multiple sources most all t v s can only output a pcm digitally processed audio signal which basically means you re losing a good bit of quality this comes into play majorly if you want true channel separation or are looking to incorporate a sub and rear channel speakers to this system while you may be happy with the quality you get by connecting the soundbar this way it s certainly going to be far better than any t v speakers i wanted to use this soundbar to it s full potential n nthe solution get yourself a optical switcher that will let you bypass the t v and run all of you sources directly to the switcher the output of the switcher will run to the soundbar giving you amazing audio i purchased the c2g toslink digital audio switcher off of amazon for 40 it passes full 5 1 audio thus giving your playbar a true 3 0 signal to work with your channels will be separated clear and it makes a huge difference if you decide to grow your system with a sub and rear speakers which i do this switcher will make an even bigger impact n nnow i ve seen all the arguments i should n t have to buy another piece of equipment to make this 700 soundbar work sonos should have designed it with more inputs and sonos should have designed it to pass through hdmi n nthe thing is if you do n t like sonos you wo n t like a sonosplaybar yes it would be nice if the soundbar had more inputs but sonos is a company that does quality through simplicity ipads only have one connection on them as well and you either are an apple person or you are n t it s not necessarily their fault that t v s output a crap audio signal as t v s progress i m sure that they will improve on this but for now there is a easy way around it n nfor me it was worth spending an extra 40 to unlock the full potential of this soundbar that my t v was hindering nif you have n t tried sonos i would highly highly recommend anyone with a reliable wifi connection to buy this soundbar n nnow to start saving for the sonos sub
3;99;59;0.8777954311961328;i m an absolute sonos fanatic owning 9 pieces in all i run the playbar sub play 1 surrounds in my media room i ve owned the playbar since a couple weeks after it launched but am just now writing a review i want to think it is the best performing speaker in the history of mankind but quite simply its not the bass is very light ca n t expect too much from any soundbar and it is not especially clear nor does it fill the room with sound it sounds substantially better than tv speakers but still sounds flat n non the positive side it rounds out an existing sonos ecosystem very nicely and the implementation is very clean i can control the volume with my app and listen to music with all the speakers with the use of my macbook and or phone app just like any other sonos component by itself the play 5 outperforms it when playing pure music as it has punchier bass and seemingly wider dynamic range n nin summary i d recommend the playbar if you re rounding out your sonos setup but there are likely better options you should consider if that s not the case spending close to 1800 for my system s quality would probably something i d think about a bit more before i dove in but i built the system slowly after i built upon the playbar n non a complete side note the sub is the best sonos component by far but also the biggest luxury the play 5 s are probably second best due to their sound quality the other components in their line all somewhere under those the playbar is probably the least bang for your buck since there are cheaper superior alternatives to be had for the same price but again if you re a sonos nut i would n t recommend against it n nalthough this is n t a glowing review its basically the truth you basically have to weigh how much you value the wireless ness of the sub and surrounds and the sonos ecosystem if you do n t then its no brainer to not get this system however if you re all in to sonos the system performs adequately just do n t prepare to have your socks blown off
4;37;17;0.8760478785306017;this is a hard review for me to write mostly because i have some very strong very conflicting feelings on the playbar and sonos in general n nfirst the general context of where i m coming from in addition to being the person who most cared knew the most about speakers amps etc of all my friends and family i also spent nearly 2 years recently working for a very high end home theater and home automation company what do i mean by high end it means although way way outside my price range i regularly heard music demos of some highly regarded equipment from b w mcintosh focal martin logan audioquest hell we even had audiophile grade and 23 000 a pair magico s3s powered by aesthetix atlas amps in our showroom point of this long winded story is that i ve heard some of the best very subjective term that the audio world had to offer but i can tell you that the number one brand we sold for distributed audio was sonos sonos was so far ahead of the game easy to use app better than the home automation software we sold rock solid flawless reliability flexibility and wireless performance the only wireless brand we ever ever considered plus they sounded good really good and when i say really good i mean for most people including myself that would hear them would concede that the sonos sounded almost as good audiophiles would disagree or at least good enough to compete with the speakers that cost several or even back to back with a pair of much more expensive speakers and at a fraction of the price were downright amazing i was completely sold on sonos and seemed like they d be set to totally kill off the old established brands it was only a matter of time in the summer of 2015 i took the plunge and purchased the whole 5 1 playbar system n nover the next two years i had some very high highs and some very low lows with this system before finally setting off my whole sonos system earlier this month here s why n nthe good n very good sound especially for music n paired with a sonos sub the bass is incredibly tight and deep not boomy not boxy you feel it the most immediate standout feature of the sound n paired with 2 play 1s as rear speakers you had a huge sounding surround sound experience and a much bigger sound for music too n dead simple to setup rock solid performance n all the streaming services i use plus dozens more n app is well designed snappy easy to use the absolute best out there n stunning industrial design as good as apple n truplay which was just released for 5 1 setup was seriously amazing expected some nice tweaks got a way way wider soundstage no clue how sonos is doing this but it was a startling difference n nthe bad n sound is not as good for movies do n t get me wrong with a good 5 1 mix it sounded completely bad ass but vocals could get lost in the mix there is a vocal boost mode changes eq and boosts center channel along with a night mode compression most issues with movies were fixed with this combo but not all and you had to compromise dynamic range and tonal balance often just to make some movies and tv shows watchable n stereo signals lack midrange not sure why it sounded so great with stereo music but with stereo sources off netflix youtube etc definitely had a slightly muddy hollow boomy sound truplay made a big difference with this but it was annoying how great it could sound for one movie or show or how distractingly muddy on others even on the same service i tested with differing headphones etc to see if this was just the recording but something about the way the playbar processes stereo just seems off n surround channels always sounded muffled in surround sound to some extent even after truplay the rear play 1s always sounded best with sound effects ambient noise and music when there was audible speech these always sounded more muffled than the playbar n nthe ugly n nso this is the crux of everything the sound issues good or bad are subjective i think anyone who listens to the playbar will think it sounds awesome and for the most part it does but the one thing though that seriously ruined this experience for me enough to have me sell my sonos the optical port i know i know everyone complains about this but this is the achilles heel and boy what a heel why is this so bad well like i ve outlined the sonos sounds the best in 5 1 with a good mix in fact it sounds stunning lin 5 1 most of the time but it really really does n t sound that great in stereo regardless of the source as many people outlined here lots of tvs only pass stereo through their optical ports but yeah no issue get a optical splitter or hdmi switch with optical audio extractor there are tons of these on amazon and you can find 2 3x of these that are reasonably priced that people recommend and hey you can use a logitech harmony remote for an elegant solution to control your tv playbar switch appletv seamlessly all true if it were only that easy for sources i had an appletv and a ps4 depending on the source and the material and the streaming service and the audio switch i was trying at the time things would work great and then not at all or sound terrible with one thing and great with everything else because sonos is so amazing in so many way i found myself like a lot of people being an apologist for it s lack of options or consistency here and i tried many many things spent not that much but too much time and money trying to fix this issue and make this work unfortunately this came to an abrupt head over the last few months the sound on the playbar started audibly stuttering clipping and momentarily dropping out on seemingly random movies tvs and shows i poured over forums emailed and called support got a new appletv got new cables got new boxes to switch the signal but this was not a problem that could be fixed in fact i believe there was nothing wrong with my playbar at all or at least it was n t broken maybe it was a software update on sonos end or maybe netflix or hbogo s end but wherever it was coming from it seems to have come from although i guess i can not say for sure from the playbar trying to unsuccessfully decode dolby digital signals glitching out and staying that way the only fix was hard reboots of the playbar this would happen at random points and sometimes not at all the thing here was there was no good option to fix this and i could n t make it stop happening no matter the settings and it was driving my fiancee and myself completely up the wall in my opinion by keeping the ethos of being simple so high on the priority list to the point of stubborn refusal to adapt how many people have asked even for a single hdmi pass though or arc on an updated playbar sonos is unfortunately making itself both way ahead of the game in some ways but completely obsolete in others and it s heart breaking n nat the end of the day with all the things they do so much better than anyone else i m waiting patiently and hopefully not in vain for sonos to come back and update their line and philosophy so i can jump back in down the road in meantime i can say that in a lot of ways sonos was the best sound system i ve ever owned but also the most frustrating
5;106;48;0.8541646526832404;first let s address the elephant in the room the price tag on this thing is a whopper i m still feeling super guilty about spending the money add to this do n t even think about getting the bar without the sub which means doubling your cost pile on the guilt factor so does that make it worth the price i m still not 100 convinced of that but this thing with the sub is simply fantastic n nif you are buying just the bar it s fine it has better sound alone than a bar sub combo i bought and returned from samsung audio is crystal clear and it gives the tv the much needed audio boost most flat screens need these days set up is super easy as soon as i installed the app it picked up my wifi and started the set up a note here if you are going to add any additional sonos speakers to your system at least one should be connected via ethernet i have a bridge in my tv console so this was easy for me it is n t necessary to have the bar hard wired however as you could add another speaker connected to ethernet later on n nthe sonos app is the only way to set up the bar once the app is up and running you play your music via the app this is different but works great i do n t like to have anything on the screen when listening to music like you have to with tv music channels so this is perfect and way better than bluetooth gone are the days of switching sources on my sound bar i can access my itunes library apple music is in beta now and sirius from the app and instantly start playing either when i m ready to watch tv it picks up the tv sound right away so easy like many things should this just works n nwhere this bar really shines though is with the addition of the sub without it the bass on the bar alone simply falls short in this facet i would say it is definitely not worth the price but if house shaking chest thumping bass is n t what you want need the bar is certainly great by itself add the sub however and you get some of the best bass i ve heard in a sound bar set up when the volume is down it provides just enough bass boost to enhance any tv music or games crank up the volume though and hold on this things thumps explosions are huge music is better and games are propelled to the next level n nthe bar is supposed to simulate surround sound but do n t expect much i ve heard a little bit of movement from left to right or right to left in the sound but not much my understanding is that this improves with the addition of more speakers however the slight movement you do get adds more depth then you would get from your tv alone or other sound bars i ve had heard n nso the bottom line is this it s expensive and even more so with the addition of the sub or more speakers but it s one of the best sounding bars out there alone and simply superb with the sub if you are looking for a sound bar set up and the price is n t a deterrent this is definitely the way to go
6;93;32;0.8419707274695459;i am new to sonos but when i was looking to buy a 4k tv i saw this soundbar i knew sonos s reputation for high audio fidelity and loved the geeky sound anywhere idea for my house i purchased it along with the subwoofer and the top of the line sony xbr75x940d the sound is great and yes get the sub if you are getting this totally worth it however beware of two things n n1 if this is your first sonos device as it was mine it must be physically connected via a cord to your ethernet connection or else the subwoofer wo n t work n n2 this soundbar does not support dts sound n ni solved 1 by buying the sonos boost and connected that to an ethernet connection now the sound with subwoofer sounds great n nthere is no workaround for 2 sonos is not working on making the playbar compatible with dts n ni have been adding blu ray discs to my collection and most of those use dts sound the only workaround is to use the dvd disc at the expense of your image resolution needless to say i m disappointed in this product when it works it s awesome but it does n t work with the latest blu ray discs save yourself some heartache and look for another soundbar for your new tv if you really want a sonos connected theatre system the recommendation is to buy a real av system and use it with the sonos connect
7;73;79;0.834111492723866;first off i am a big sonos fan i had toyed with the idea of purchasing a playbar for some time the idea of wireless rear speakers and sub combined with all the music streaming features sonos offers was very appealing to me even though it came with a high price tag n nwhen i finally bought the playbar it was as quick and simple as it can be to set and i had great sound coming from my tv in no time i added my two sonos play 1 speakers for 5 0 sound when i played a bluray disc with my ps3 i had no sound at first this did n t shock me since i knew the playbar does not support dts sound and most blurays are encoded with dts i changed the sound settings in my ps3 that it pass on only dolby digital 5 1 and pcm 2 0 as it is recommended by sonos after i did that i had sound on all speakers but it did n t seem like true surround sound checking the sonos app confirmed that the input to the playbar was stereo sound when i played the same scene in a foreign language that is encoded in dolby digital 5 1 i instantly heard a significant difference and the sonos app showed that the input is dolby digital 5 1 n ni am no expert in home theater electronics and standards i assumed the lack of dts functionality is something that is only of concern for audiophiles however it turns out that if you hope to get true surround sound your source must be dolby digital 5 1 i have spent hours of research and troubleshooting with my hardware and have found no solution to this issue this is in stark contrast to the simplicity approach of sonos n nsimplicity in setup and use does not exclude supporting more than one audio standard n nwhile i would give any other sonos device 5 stars i ca n t give the playbar more than 2 by itself it is a great device which is reflected in all the positive reviews but if you hope to get a great surround sound system when you couple it with two more sonos play 1 or play 3 speakers you will very likely be disappointed it is beyond me why sonos ignores an industry standard like dts that is used by nearly all bluray releases and any other modern 200 home theater system supports n npros n easy setup n music streaming functionality n good soundbar for 3 0 configuration n ncons n very limited support of audio standards n no true surround sound for nearly all blurays n only one toslink input so you need to rely on your tv to pass through dolby digital n expensive n nso much potential so poorly executed
8;29;16;0.8054592778074522;i started with 2 play 3s and loved them so much i bought this then of course i had to get the sub once you get a taste you ca n t stop set up is super easy with the app i also have multiple play 5s around the house i have playbar hooked up through an optical cable to my sharp aquos and the remote control for xfinity tv the remote for the cable box easily adjusts the volume for sonos so if you are worried about that you do n t have to be i also use the playbar for music when the tv is not on and it sounds great minor issue is the sound does n t sound as loud as my play 3s and 5s also at first i thought the sound was not exactly synced to the people on the screen so looked like bad lip syncing but it actually went away so either i got used to it or it corrected itself within a day or two
9;74;26;0.79885725266231;1 i bought an open box special which would only connect for the first stream then drop out after less than 2 minutes unpower repower it comes back online for less than 2 minutes i have a 4 piece sonos play 1 setup which has zero problems of this nature i returned it after many hours of problems because i did n t want to eat up my return window n n2 i bought a full price fresh unit from a major retailer after several hours of mostly tv watching through the optical audio with a lot of commercials forwarding it cuts out no sound ca n t switch to streaming audio either unpower repower it comes back on wife was on phone with sonos customer service but they said if we did n t repower it we could send the logs we d have to call back when it cuts out it is working the rest of day day this morning watching tv it cuts out again i can see it in my sonos device list but ca n t get any sound on it wife is waiting for the sonos callback but hard to keep a 5 year old occupied because he s mad his show was interrupted if they ca n t adequately explain and pinpoint the issue it s going back to the store for a refund n ni m connecting to wifi with the bar i can speculate it s a networking issue with these sound bars but sonos has been tightlipped on the support forums not wanting to lose future sales yeah i get it and am used to it n ni can speculate that maybe i need their network device to create a separate network but for those who never have problems with this playbar they have to have something in common i m willing to buy it if it will certainly fix the problem once and for all i also do n t see people posting resolutions when they review the problems that is n t a good sign either n ntime will tell whether i end up happy or end up in the return line before this return window expires n nupdate 12 20 16 n nsonos customer service says the diagnostics indicate this is a defective unit i guess i ll be standing in line later at best buy because they offered zero resolution nor can they adequately explain why it s defective this could explain why i see a plethora of open box units for sale the rest of their stuff is good but the playbar is not ready for prime time apparently i have owned two units and both were bad i might try a third for giggles and grins just to see if i m betting i ll have no better luck from this brand
10;81;31;0.7916821297352599;i purchased a playbar sub and 2 surround speakers in january 2014 i like the system and it sounds great now in sep 2016 the playbar went dead and i could n t bring it back up on the controller i tried factory resetting several times to no avail i finally had to give in and call tech support i explained the problem and sent them the diagnostics report in the end they said the unit had frozen and would need to be replaced they also said they have a one year warranty but since i was the original owner the would replace it for 190 and would not come down off that quite a bit of money to spend for something that only lasted 2 and half years i went ahead and paid for the replacement because it is a great system when it s working i just hope the replacement lasts a lot longer
11;65;34;0.7838560035638441;i ll admit the sonos playbar is not cheap and probably not the best value if you re concerned about bang for your buck however if you re already using any other sonos speakers in your home and you re in the market for a sound bar i do n t know why you d get anything else n nthe playbar hooks up to the optical output from your tv or home theater receiver so you ll first want to make sure that you have an optical output if you do n t the sonos playbar wo n t work with your tv n nonce hooked up the sonos app i used the ios app walks you through the setup of the playbar which is just like any other sonos speaker for the most part the only difference is that the playbar setup also takes you through a step where it learns the volume up down controls from your tv it then walks you through turning off your tv speakers the idea here is that the playbar replaces your tv speakers but you can now control the playbar volume from your tv remote as usual n nof course as a sonos device you can still play streaming audio through it just like any other sonos speaker and you can group it with other sonos speakers as well the playbar seems to do a really good job of figuring out what you re trying to do with it i can be streaming music through it one moment and then when i turn the tv on it switches over to tv audio instead n nthe playbar is also pretty flexible in terms of placement you can set it on a shelf or with the separate wall mount bracket you can mount it on the wall above or below your tv with only two cables running to it power and optical audio it s also pretty easy to hide the cables n nsound quality is excellent and can be improved further by pairing it with a sonos subwoofer i have n t done that yet because the playbar alone is sufficient for my uses currently
12;71;33;0.736308484319028;i was n t impressed with the sound quality of this thing mind you that i was upgrading from a 10 plus year old bose system the sound seems too processed if this is your first soundbar you might notice a difference and actually like it i went from 5 1 setup to this and the sub to save on space n nonly pro it saves space n nalso it s a it annoying that your phone ca n t connect to it via bluetooth and you have to essentially use sonos app to stream all your music thru the bar
13;35;25;0.6954402585376142;the playbar very good the playbar the sub even better the soundbar the sub two play 1 speakers un freaking paralleled i thought i had maybe had an eargasm before once like in college but after experiencing the entire surround sound set up offered by sonos i realized that what i had experienced before was merely the tip of an iceberg you definitely get what you pay for with this system and i would whole heartedly recommend it if nothing else the setup is worth the purchase it was easy enough that joe biden could do it and frankly it was fun i can just picture joe walking around his living room grinning from ear to ear as he goes through the tuning process man i love that guy
14;55;20;0.6932184410505551;here s why sonos sucks n nrestriction the number one reason sonos sucks is that you can not use it as a wireless speaker want to quickly connect and play music from your laptop nope want friends to be able to stream as well nope want to stream spotify sure if you re a premium subscriber otherwise nah for 700 you expect to be able to use your speakers however you choose but apparently sonos management feels differently this quite frankly is some offensive bs i get it software subscription and revshare models are great for the vendor but having them forced on you as a customer buying a speaker is garbage what s next is lexus going to sell me a car and charge me monthly for data transfer from my wheels to my speedometer will apple begin charging monthly for data streamed from your phone to your watch n nsound sound is ok not great by any means my neighbor used to have a martin logan that sounded full and amazing i have a 55 sony xbr from 2014 and the playbar simply is n t much of an upgrade n napp the app is poorly designed and does n t allow for much customization at all clearly an app made by a hardware company n noverall i probably should have done more research so i ll take responsibility on that front that said sonos is overpriced over constrained and an overwhelmingly poor value and user experience
15;38;13;0.6505077315796405;i bought a play 1 a play 3 and a playbar and set them up in 3 different rooms the app often can not find any of them and when it can find something it finds a random single speaker instead of all 3 this problem happens on multiple phones and their feedback is to reconfigure the speakers which only solves the problem for a short time n nas for sound quality the speakers that are part of my tv are better for watching tv and movies but the soundbar is better for music
16;10;4;0.6026009494276168;i really regret buying this it does n t have bluetooth or the capability to connect to my devices over wireless for anything other than music if i want to use my dvd player or chromecast with my computer to watch netflix etc the sound comes out of my tv or projector not the soundbar i ve contacted support a few times to see if there s any additional cables or adapters that i can buy to connect the system and they ve never been helpful total waste of money

120;1.0;2.0;2687.0;I'm a HUGE Sonos fan.  I own 3 Play:5's and a Sub.  I'd been wanting to replace my bulky 5.1 speaker system with a Playbar since it was rumored.  All their products have incredible sound quality so I was optimistic about this set up.\n\nSet up is easy, sound quality is good for the unit.  It's a nice product and looks great while being easy to operate (although more reliant on the Sonos application than I'd prefer).  It's the typical awesomeness that you get with any Sonos product.\n\nWhen testing the Playbar with a direct connection to a device (e.g. Apple TV) and running it compared to my 5 speaker system through my receiver I was impressed with the quality.  Sound was more spread out and filled the room better but dialog/center was ultimately a bit shallow feeling.  If you turn on speech enhancement in the menu it helps out but something still feels slightly off.  It's something you're unlikely to notice unless you're actively comparing like I was but to the Playbar's credit it was no slouch.  I had a few people compare with me and everyone picked the typical 5.1 setup for better sound but had positive things to say about the Playbar - mainly noting its shallow feel in certain rangers and with dialog as the main issues.\n\nHere's the issue though: Sonos says they want you to use your TV as a hub, all the inputs going to the TV and then optical audio out from the TV to the Playbar.  Great idea - but the problem is that most TV's won't pass Dolby Digital (DD) 5.1 surround from HDMI to the digital/optical audio.  If it's from the TV itself (such as Netflix on a smart TV) or input directly from the coaxial cable it will pass 5.1 through the optical port BUT not from HDMI.  This is either required to be HDCP compliant or is a licensing/cost issue (not sure).  There are a few tv's that do this but they're few and far between and hard to verify.\n\nSo if you have multiple sources (say an Xbox 360, Blu-Ray player, Apple TV, etc) there's no way for those sources to ever deliver 5.1 to the Playbar as Sonos intended (assuming you add a sub and some Play:3's to the mix).  And you can't wire multiple inputs directly to the Playbar because they have a single input for the sake of simplicity.  Normally I'm fine with this, but in light of the limitation with HDMI => optical pass through on TVs this became an oversight to me upon learning about the pass through issue.  You can solve this by finding a TV or receiver that does pass through DD 5.1 through the optical audio, but you shouldn't have to.  Alternatively you can use an optical audio switch, which is fine most of the time but may not work with a blu-ray player since Playbar lacks DTS support and are also limited on inputs, but this doesn't solve what to do for certain devices that don't have an optical audio port (e.g. most computers, Wii U, etc).\n\nIn the end you're left with a system that is capable of producing much better sound (especially if a sub and some Play:3s are added) that most everyone won't be able to hear and results in this not sounding as good as it costs.  And that's just a shame to me.\n\nPros:\n++Easy set up\n++Sonos\n+Decent sound from stereo source\n\nCons:\n---Single optical input only\n--No DTS support\n--Entire package is expensive for 5.1 (or even 3.1)\n\nThe only scenario I can see this being a good thing is if you have a room where you want to add a Sonos component and a soundbar to and you want to do it in a single package without caring about other components, like for a Den or a bedroom.  Any other solution seems like there'd be a better option.\n\nUltimately I'm disappointed.  Had Sonos included multiple audio inputs or HDMI pass through, or even better yet HDMI switching (in place of a receiver) then this could have been an amazing piece.  But the reliance on a single optical input being provided from the TV, one which will down convert any HDMI source's audio to stereo sound, in the name of simplicity just seems like a bad idea.\n\nHad I known about the tv's not passing through audio I wouldn't have bought this.  My mistake, honestly, but it just makes it baffling as to why Sonos didn't provide different input options.  As it stands I'm returning it.  Hopefully Sonos will look in to making an HDMI hub option as an accessory.\n\n** Update **\nThe landscape has changed in terms of tvs that do pass 5.1 through and it's better.  It's still difficult to determine precisely so I'd suggest checking forums to see if your TV does in indeed pass 5.1 out.  My 2015 LG OLED does not but I'm under the impression the 2017 models do, possibly the 2016 models for example.  That all said I think my points made above still stand.  Most existing TVs don't do this and it's still very hard to verify.\n\nAdditionally I'd like to note the omission of another audio format, Dolby Atmos.  Sonos says they elected to omit this on the Playbase (the related product to this) because so few things used it and they wanted to focus on streaming but the issue is this limits user choice.  Vudu, Netflix, and iTunes support or will support Dolby Atmos.  There are likely more services that do as well.\n\nThey have their very specific viewpoint of how people should use this product and with what (5.1 over optical in DD, steaming services) and that options aren't needed.  There are better products out there, especially for the total money spent.  I'm not saying there's no market for this or it's terrible - if you have a TV that passes 5.1 and you don't care about DTS and Dolby Atmos it's a fine product and exactly the scenario that Sonos has in mind.  But if you want options or don't have a TV that will and you'll be limited to stereo, look elsewhere then.  You can do better or cheaper.  It's just a shame that Sonos continues to limit this product as, when it works as they want it to, it's great.;True 5.1 ruined for the sake of simplicity
2;2.0;1.0;25.0;"I love the sound and the functionality of the app. I'm giving this 1 star due to the inability to update the system each time there is a software update. I have a total of 17 sonos devices in my home. Each time there is a software update the update fails - I get the following error:\n---------------------\nUpdate Problem\nThere was a problem during the update of your Sonos system.\nSelect ""Try again"" to repeat the update.\n---------------------\nWhen I click on ""more info"" on the error I get:\nThe following errors occurred during the update:\nDisconnected from system: Office, Basement, Master Bedroom + 13\nError Code 1002: Bridge\n---------------------\nRepeated attempts are also unsuccessful. The error code (1002) recommends rebooting the bridge which I've done repeatedly and doesn't work (didn't work for the last update either). The next step is to reboot (unplug) each sonos device and retry the update. The problem is I have three sound bars mounted directly under TV's on the wall and plugged in to outlet behind the TV. Really - I have to remove the TV or unmount the speaker to reboot?\n\nOK - I just won't do the update. Well, since I haven't done the update the app won't let me reauthorize my Apply Music subscription so my library is essentially not available resulting in a non-functional system.\n\nIf I would have known the manufacturer would ELIMINATE the ability to use hardware I've purchased for not doing an update I definitely would have chosen another system. Very disappointed. Very frustrated that updates are insanely difficult.";Would rethink my purchase given the problems with updating
125;3.0;4.0;538.0;"The SONOS PlayBar may seem expensive for a sound bar, but only if you look at it as just a sound bar. Really it does much more (and I'll get to that). But first, as a sound bar, it works well and is pretty easy to set up: plug in the power cord and an optical cable from your TV and that's it, as far as audio connections go. To fully configure the unit and get it to work with your existing remote, you'll need to install the SONOS controller app (free) which runs on PC, Mac, Android and iOS devices. In the app is where you ""add a device"" (add the PlayBar to your home network) and establish the SONOS network in your home.\n\nIf you don't have any other SONOS products in your home already, you'll need to either connect the PlayBar to a network router or network switch with a standard network cable (one of which is included in the box), or purchase a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SONOS-BRIDGE/dp/B000X1TS54/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SONOS BRIDGE</a>&nbsp;which plugs into your network router and allows the PlayBar to connect to your network wirelessly. The reason you need this is that the SONOS mesh network is actually separate from your existing WiFi network (it makes its own), which is great because it doesn't interfere with regular WiFi traffic, and vice versa.  This means fewer dropouts in your music.\n\nUPDATE: in 2014, SONOS rolled out a software update that allows all existing SONOS speakers to work without the need for a Bridge. So as long as you have a solid WiFi connection in your home, any SONOS speaker (even a Play:1 or the PlayBar) can play music wirelessly.\n\nAdding the PlayBar to your Sonos system requires pushing a couple of buttons on the unit itself when prompted by the app and then telling the SONOS app what room it's in. Then you can program the PlayBar to respond to your existing TV remote or cable/satellite remote. An on-screen wizard walks you through this.  Tip! - If you can't get the PlayBar to recognize commands from your DISH or DIRECTV or cable remote, then you may need to first set up that other remote to control your TV. Most set top box remotes come without any TV remote commands pre-programmed into them so if you try to program it into the PlayBar, you won't get very far. This was a problem for me with a DISH remote until I first programmed the DISH remote to control my TV, then the PlayBar was able to see the remote and respond to it for volume control. Once you do that, you can do the basic operation of the bar (volume up/down) using your existing remote control, and you won't have to refer back to the app. The PlayBar's optical digital input automatically gets preference, so if you're listening to music on it, then turn on the TV, it will automatically switch over to TV sound.\n\nIn terms of sound quality, the PlayBar blows away any TV speakers I've heard. The thinner a TV gets, the worse it sounds. Speakers need some room to resonate, and the PlayBar has that, while flat panel TVs do not. Movie dialog, male or female vocals have a nice transparency on the PlayBar, treble and high frequencies are detailed without being harsh and bass response is tight, if not prodigious (there's only so much bass you can get from a small cabinet).\n\nThe PlayBar uses some acoustic and electronic techniques to expand the sound stage so it sounds wider than it is. I noticed this on a few songs and movies, but it was particularly obvious on Rush ""2112"" and on The Moody Blues ""Wildest Dreams."" The instruments appeared to be located outside the edges of the bar while vocals were locked in place in the center. There are a total of 9 speakers on the PlayBar (each with its own amplifier) and SONOS uses this entire array to create a coherent soundstage.\n\nBut, as good as it sounds, the PlayBar isn't perfect. Bass is on the lighter side, and if you use the EQ controls in the SONOS app to boost the bass, it gets a bit boomy. Also, the PlayBar can get a bit congested and harsh when pushed to higher sound levels, though this is definitely better if you add the Sonos sub. With the sub, the PlayBar can then allocate its amplification and drivers to the midrange and treble which are easier to drive without distortion. Also, these sonic deficiencies are only evident when comparing the unit to a dedicated surround sound system.\n\nBut there are two reasons why the PlayBar is unique and gets my recommendation: A.) it's upgradeable to fully discrete and wireless 5.1 surround (with the addition of the Sonos sub and a pair of Play:1 or Play:3 speakers) and B.) it's a SONOS! (more on that later). I tested the PlayBar on its own and then with the sub and play:3 rear speakers. Adding the sub and rear speakers was a simple as adding the initial PlayBar to the Sonos network, but there is a new option within the ""room set-up"" that allows you to group the play:3s, play:1s (or a Connect amp) as surround speakers for the PlayBar in the same room. The set-up wizard asks a couple of questions about distance from listening position to the rear speakers and (for the subwoofer) some questions about the levels, but that's about it.\n\nWith the Sub and Play:3s added, the system was able to reproduce discrete 5.1 channel Dolby Digital surround sound. I confirmed this using a 5.1 channel test track from one of Dolby's sampler discs as well as some movie clips and a couple of full length films. The PlayBar does not decode DTS but this may not be a show-stopper for some as few TVs output or pass through DTS. The issue with this or any sound bar that uses the TV's digital output for sound is that most TVs will not pass through a Dolby Digital 5.1 signal from source through to TV output. Some Sony TVs do it as well as some VIZIOs and some LGs (there may be others), but most TVs will drop the signal down to 2-channel output at the fiberoptic digital out. For this reason, I would have liked to see a second digital input on the PlayBar as well as DTS decoding. This way you could use one input for the TV and the second input for a DVD or Blu-ray Player to get discrete 5.1 sound from that. I can understand why SONOS chose this single-input approach - if there were an ""input"" function on the PlayBar to switch inputs, chances are things could have gotten confusing for some users. Still, for advanced users, the second input and DTS decoding would have been appreciated.\n\nThere is a workaround to this issue (not the DTS decoding, but the extra fiberoptic input), if you're willing to sacrifice some simplicity. You can buy a fiber optic digital audio switch box, connect your devices to this, plug its output into the PlayBar and then get discrete 5.1 surround from Dolby Digital content on a cable box, streaming set-top box, DVD player or Blu-ray player. There are several of these switches available on Amazon including this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/basic-manual-switch/dp/B000812QC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">basic manual switch</a>, and this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/more-advanced-remote-controlled-switch/dp/B00G188Z7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">more advanced remote-controlled switch</a>. There are many others available like this.\n\nIn any case, The PlayBar does decode surround-encoded 2-channel PCM or Dolby Digital sound (which TVs do output) and will give you a reasonable surround sound stage even from this material as long as there is rear channel information encoded into the content. And if you do have a true 5.1 source, like the streaming apps built into your TV (Netflix, Vudu, Amazon VOD) or your TV's built-in ATSC tuner, then you will get even better sound with discrete 5.1 surround.\n\nWatching a movie in full 5.1 Dolby Digital surround on the system is a vastly improved experience over the PlayBar alone: bass is deep and extended without being bloated; surround effects emanate from all around the room and overall dynamic range is enhanced as the PlayBar is able to concentrate all its power on the front three channels, without having to worry about surround or low bass. The only caveat? Adding the sub and play:3 rears brings the system cost from $700 to $about $1,800 and that's a bit steep.\n\nSONOS: The Killer App for Music\n\nIn addition to being a sound bar, the PlayBar is also an independent wireless SONOS zone. This means you can fire up the SONOS app on your phone or tablet, access your digital music collection stored on a PC or local network drive (or in iTunes on an iPhone or iPad) and play it back through the PlayBar. You can also access a ton of different online music streaming services, some of which are free, and some of which require a subscription. I was finding songs and discovering new artists on Spotify, accessing my local MP3 collection on my PC and streaming Pandora radio stations just minutes after opening the box. And the nice thing about SONOS is that it manages music from these different services in a single playback queue - so one song came from Spotify, then a couple from one of my ripped CDs, the next from Spotify... you get the idea.\n\nFor those who say you can do that wireless music streaming stuff with AirPlay, or an AppleTV (etc.), I say, ""poppycock!"" Yes, AirPlay allows you to stream music from your phone, tablet or computer wirelessly. But to use Apple TV, you're limited to the Apple ecosystem (e.g. iTunes) and whichever apps Apple chooses to enable. SONOS is more of an open platform with support for different file formats as well as all of the most popular music streaming apps and services. Also with AppleTV and virtually any other streaming media box, you have to have the TV on and switched to the correct input in order to hear anything or see what's playing. For music listening, this just isn't convenient. With the PlayBar, everything is driven through the SONOS app on your smart phone, PC or tablet. Pick your music, press play and you're good to go. And when you want to switch back over to watching TV, the PlayBar handles that for you automatically so the sound matches the picture.\n\nI found myself listening to a lot more music with the PlayBar in the living room, because it's not just easy but actually fun. If you're feeling adventurous (or home sick after a move) you can also access any of thousands of streaming internet radio stations, right within the app.\n\nIf you add on more SONOS components (Play:3, Play:5, etc.) throughout your home, you can decide which room gets which music, right from your smart phone, PC or tablet.  It's an advanced multi-room audio system without the cost of installation or the need to rip up your walls. Also, with the PlayBar in the system and connected to your TV, you can pipe that TV sound to any other SONOS wireless zone in your home which was an unexpected bonus.\n\nFor TV listening, the PlayBar has some nice features which work standalone or with the full 5.1 system.  ""Night"" mode compresses the dynamic range so you can hear whispered dialog and subtle surround effects without the loud parts of the movie being overpowering. ""Speech enhancement"" brings the dialog forward in the mix so you can make out what characters are saying, even when there are other distractions. You can use both at the same time or each feature independently. I tested both and found that they did make subtle but noticeable improvements to dialog intelligibility. And the Night mode did equalize differences between soft and quiet points.  I found I could keep ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,"" at a reasonable volume level and I didn't need to leap for the remote when the explosions kicked in. But for daytime movie viewing (and for music) I left these features turned off.\n\nTurn-Ons:\n\n* Good sound overall, considering size\n* Simple connection, set-up and operation\n* Nice-looking unit\n* Flexible installation\n* SONOS app puts the world of music at your fingertips.\n\nTurn-Offs:\n\n* Needs more bass\n* Gets a bit congested at high volumes\n* Could use a second fiberoptic input and DTS support\n* Limited by TV's ability to pass through 5.1 surround\n* A little pricey\n\nReviewing the PlayBar is a bit tricky. As a pure sound bar, it's a nice sounding simple solution that can plug and play with your existing TV and remote. But again, as a pure sound bar, it's expensive and doesn't offer the low bass extension of many more affordable sound bar/subwoofer combos. But unlike most sound bars, the PlayBar is upgradeable. Find the bass a bit light?  Add a sub. Want to experience discrete surround sound? Add a pair of Play:1s as surrounds. This is something most other sound bars simply cannot do. But what really sets the PlayBar apart from every other sound bar on the planet is that it's also a SONOS wireless speaker with all the streaming musical goodness that the SONOS platform has to offer. You'll come for the enhanced sound from movies and TV, but you'll stay for the music. Recommended.\n\nUPDATE (October, 2013): The rear channels of a PlayBar 5.1 system can now be the new less expensive Play:1 speakers, or you can use your own speakers with the CONNECT amp. The Play:3 is also still supported as a rear channel speaker for a PlayBar multi-channel system.\n\nA more detailed review is available on Big Picture Big Sound (dot com).";More Than Just a Sound Bar, but Less Than Perfect
1;4.0;5.0;501.0;"We have a small 10'x12' game room for our Xbox 360 and Wii U. Each console is hooked up to a LG 47"" LED TV. The video quality is fantastic but the sound left a lot to be desired. This ""problem"" needed a solution. I set four simple goals to address this.\n\n1) The system had to sound great.\n2) High Wife Acceptance Factor. :)\n3) I did not want to run a separate A/V receiver. I simply don't have the room.\n4) I did not want to run wires under the baseboards or carpet.\n\nTo achieve these goals I decided to build a complete Sonos Home Theater System, with the new PLAYBAR front and center (literally).\n\nHere are the components I chose for my system:\n\n - Sonos BRIDGE\n - Sonos PLAYBAR\n - Sonos SUB\n - Sonos PLAY:3 (x2 as Surround Speakers)\n\nLet's start with the setup. First thing I did was download the Sonos software for my laptop and hooked up the Wireless BRIDGE to my router. After the software downloaded and installed, getting the BRIDGE recognized by the software was as simple as pressing a button.\n\nAfter the BRIDGE was set-up, I went on to tackle the PLAYBAR. Installation was equally as simple. An optical cable from the TV along with power from an outlet are the only two wires needed to get running. Press a couple buttons to sync the PLAYBAR with the BRIDGE, follow a few prompts in the software, disable the TV speakers, and the PLAYBAR is handling audio for my TV and game consoles. It was super-simple and a dramatic improvement in fidelity compared to the TV's built-in speakers.\n\nNext up was adding the subwoofer and surrounds. I found a nice spot in the corner of the game room and hooked up the power cable to the sub. Press a button on the front of the SUB, follow a few prompts in the software, and the subwoofer is handling the low frequencies. Adding the two PLAY:3 surround speakers was just as easy. Provide power to each PLAY:3, press two buttons on each speaker, follow the prompts in the software, and your done.\n\nMy new Game Room/Home Theater system was complete. Installation took less than an hour from start to finish. No big bulky receiver, no running wires under the carpet or baseboards, and the wife approves!\n\nHow does it sound?\n\nAfter minimal tweaking in the Calibration Menus I got the sound just right. Mids and highs are clean and crisp, voices are clear, and the SUB is in perfect lock-step delivering deep/tight bass to Movies, Music and Games. This is an incredibly balanced combination that fills the room with accurate, high-quality sound. I honestly wasn't expecting to be this impresssed. I'm stunned by quality delivered without a dedicated A/V receiver. Incredible job, Sonos!\n\nHere are a few of the software features that I found most helpful.\n\n1) You can turn off the white status light on each speaker. This is great if you find those lights to be a distraction when the room is dark.\n2) You can enhance/amplify ""Voice/Speech"" which makes hearing dialog at low volume levels much easier.\n3) Not all room seating is rectangular. When calibrating the Surround Speakers you have the option for setting distances independently for the main seating position. Note: This is somewhat limited as the only three options to choose from are less than 2ft, 2-10ft and over 10ft.\n\nI took some screenshots of the software menus I found helpful. Check 'em out under Customer Images along with some photos of the PLAYBAR in my game room.\n\nI almost forgot. A review wouldn't be complete without at least a ""Con"". Here is my one real pet peave. There are no official Windows RT or Windows Phone 8 apps. It would be great to use my Surface RT tablet and/or my Nokia Lumia 920 phone as a controller for the system.\n\nThat's it for now.

126;5.0;3.0;240.0;"This is addition to my Sonos enabled home, so you can also read my reviews of other Sonos products. Sonos makes amazing home audio solutions, so whenever I add a component, I always write a review...\n\nSummary : I was so excited by the concept of a Playbar. I have Sonos speakers in two other rooms of my house, but it is unfortunately not integrated in my two rooms with surround sound speaker systems. I would kill to have Sonos wireless music in those rooms, but seamlessly integrate with my existing A/V setups. That is what Playbar is for. Super exciting. While the setup experience and audio quality of Playbar is great and up to the usual Sonos quality bar, it unfortunately doesn't work with my Sharp Aqous TV, and I think that might be the tiny Achilles heel of this product. It probably works with most, but not every HDTV, due to a basic setup assumption. I love the Playbar concept, and it probably works great for most people!\n\nReview :\n\nI got this product to integrate into my main living room A/V experience. My LR is about 20'x16' with no separation from another 20'x16' dining room. Relatively big space to fill with audio. I've got a relatively generic 5 speaker setup, with no sub because everyone else in the house complains about the noise level when it is enabled ;-) I mounted my Sharp Aquos 46D62U on the wall, and ran HDMI and component\nin-wall between a lower cabinet and the wall plate behind the Sharp. Pretty standard. I've got a number of HDMI sources running into a Onkyo amp, then one HDMI from the amp to the TV through the in-wall wiring. My goal in adding Playbar was to disable the existing room speakers, and use the Playbar as the audio source. I would get full Sonos integration plus audio from my existing PS3, Xbox 360, and AppleTV. Wee!\n\nThe out of the box experience was mostly to Sonos's standard quality level. I've come to expect that setup is very easy, and it was. They've added the steps needed to check audio coming from your TV source, and to configure your remote control to change volume on the Playbar. This all worked well for me.\n\nThe sound quality was also up to the high Sonos standards. I loved having my music collection seamlessly stream into my living room, finally. And as I'll explain in a minute, when I tested with an alternate TV, the audio quality for game (PS3, Xbox 360) and movie sources was quite good. I think for bigger rooms you'll want to add the Sonos Sub for depth, but for smaller rooms the sound was high quality and bright.\n\nThere were two big gotchas that will not affect everyone, but affected me. I think it is important to understand them before purchasing a Playbar:\n\n1 - If you have an in-wall installation for your TV, adding/retrofitting Playbar into the environment is not hard, but requires some manual dexterity and a longer digital audio cable than ships in the box. Most people with an in-wall installation do not think of putting optical audio cables into the wall during the initial buildout. Audio was supposed to transfer via HDMI in the new world order. This means you have to difficultly get behind the TV (most of the time flush mounted), plug in an optical audio cable, then run this unsightly cable down from the TV to the Playbar.  I went in-wall because I wanted a nice aesthetic, but that cable ruins the clean visual experience.\n\nThe optical cable that ships with the Playbar is way too short for most runs from the back of a wall mounted TV to the Playbar. Most TVs have their connections in the back to one side (right, often), so you have to run the optical cable back to center, then straight drop it to the center of the Playbar where its connectors are. If you don't want an oddly angled cable running from the Playbar to the TV, this involves a few 90 degree bends, which adds to the required cable length. The Sonos supplied short optical cable was in no way long enough for this, but as a bit of an audio geek, I had extra optical cables of various lengths. If you don't have extra optical cables of longer length, be prepared to buy one to finish this install. This is a rare ""fit and finish"" miss for Sonos.\n\n2 - The basic premise of the Playbar solution is that you run all HDMI to the TV, then an optical audio cable from the TV to the Playbar. This is a huge assumption about the age of most people's TVs. New TVs have plenty of HDMI ports and the assumption that there is a working audio optical out is probably ok. What I learned is that my older (sold in 2006-2008 at high volume) but still good Sharp Aquos 46D62U has that optical audio out, but it was designed only for ATSC (over the air HDTV) audio. It is not a generic pass-through audio port. Translation, the Playbar does not work with my TV. But I had no way of knowing this when I got the Playbar. There is no list I could find of TVs that will not work with the Playbar, but I can guarantee these exist. It took me three hours of super geeking to learn all of this, buried in manuals and AVForum posts. In this way I'm not the average Sonos customer, as less of a geek would have gotten frustrated and taken something back well before this.\n\nI trust Sonos, and assume that the vast majority of TVs work with this digital audio pass-through model. I grabbed a newer Sony TV I had stored and hooked it up outside my home theatre room, and it worked well. Maybe mine is a rare case, but I wonder with less expensive or older HDTVs, will Playbar work every time. Hopefully FAQs will quickly appear documenting the few TVs that won't work with Playbar, so you don't have to order something that has a very low but possible chance of not working with your TV...\n\nAll in all, I really love the Playbar concept, and wish, oh wish, it had worked in my main home theatre room. The sound quality is great and setup is a breeze. Now to convince my wife I need a new TV for the living room?!";I like Playbar, but it is not for everyone
3;6.0;5.0;10.0;"I bought this sound bar to go with my 65"" OLED TV so I would get great sound while watching movies.  It achieved that goal, but what I never expected was how good music sounds on this and how nice the Sonos app is for finding music.  I paired it with a Sonos subwoofer which I highly recommend and now there are nights where I never turn the TV on, but just listen to albums I loved from my past and new music.  Totally delightful.";TV and movies sound great, but I have rediscovered music with this!
58;7.0;5.0;74.0;I own 2 or more of every Sonos speaker: Play1, Play3, Play5, Subwoofer, and now this PlayBar.  This playbar not only has outstanding sound by itself, but when combined with two play1's and the sub, it is absolutely outstanding for Dolby Digital surround.  As for the issue of TVs not sending Dolby Digital through optical cable to the soundbar, here is the SIMPLE SOLUTION, sold from Amazon (Monorpice product) ****105557 4x1 HDMI Switch with Toslink, Digital Coaxial and 3D Support****. It is a simple switch.  My setup is as follows.  I have Comcast box, Roku (newest one), PS4, and Wii U running HDMIs to the switch from Monoprice mentioned above, then you run an optical cable from the switch to the Playbar and an HDMI from the switch to your TV.  Then turn your TV speakers OFF in the sound settings menu.  make sure oyu buy some ultra thin HDMI short cables fomr monoprice too or the cables are gonna get unwieldy (Monoprice is cheap!).  People mentioned Roku not sending Dolby Digital 5.1 and only DTS, but this isn't true for the newer Roku model.  Just go to setting in the Roku and set DD 5.1.  With this setup your soundbar will be getting DD 5.1 for all your peripherals.  And let me save you time reading through negative reviews on the switch---the only critique is the SUPER bright LEDs on the front of it---just use black electrical tape over the bright lights, just don't block the IR sensor.  This Sonos surround setup is way sleeker than having wired speakers and sounds unbelievable, honestly, I can't imagine needing more in a house unless you are some kind of major audiophile.  And you can use the Sonos for just playing music or move them around for a party. I have never heard a Sonos speaker skip in the 3 years I have owned them.  Highly recommend this soundbar or any Sonos product for tha tmaterr---if oyu have the flow!;Read this review to address tech issue
9;8.0;5.0;30.0;"I have a JVC high definition TV with better than average sound. However, whenever I watch a British show, I have to use closed caption. I purchased a Samsung sound bar with wireless subwoofer. The sound is noticeably better, but I still need CC.  On top of that, I am a passionate audiophile and a drummer?  I was interested in having a system that projected resonant vocals, as well as the full range of instrumental sounds. I ordered the Sonos Playbar TV sound bar and the SUB wireless subwoofer. After a nobrainer install, I downloaded the Sonos app, which is intuitive, holds all my Amazon Music, Spotify, Apple Music songs, etc. which are easily accessed, and my TV remote volume control manages both TV and streaming audio. Hookup involves an optical-digital connection. The supplied cord is short and I replaced it with a 6 ' cord.\nNo problems so far. The audio quality from the PLAYBAR is superb, but bass tones are greatly enhanced by the subwoofer, which is a costly, but in my opinion mandatory purchase. Using the PLAYBAR/SUB tandem, streamed music sounds ""in person."" I may get a couple of the Sonos play 1 speakers to arrange a surround setup. Anyone who criticizes the price of these items, might also criticize Festool for selling a miter saw for almost $1500. The saw is virtually dustless, just as the soundbar/subwoofer is virtually flawless. Value is a very personal thing. For me Sonos has satisfied my requisites for a very pleasurable listening experience. The system is highly recommended.";HEARING IS BELIEVING! This sound bar is terrific (please get the subwoofer too).
5;9.0;2.0;13.0;"Let me start by saying I'm a huge SONOS fan and have invested a lot of money in their equipment, I've always been impressed with their products. So I was completely dismayed and upset when I found out this Playbar has a huge issue. IT ONLY WORKS WITH IR REMOTES!!! So if your TV uses any of the more modern remote formats (in my case Wi-Fi direct) you will not be able to control the volume of the player using the TV remote. To use the TV remote to control channels, then a separate app to control the sound volume is just ridiculous. I honestly can't believe you can spend $600 on a sound bar that doesn't recognize all remote formats. So if your TV uses an IR remote, then go ahead and get this, but if your TV uses any other format you need to steer clear of this product. SONOS really dropped the ball on this. They should have this in the product description in big bold letters: ""WARNING: ONLY WORKS WITH IR REMOTES!"" I never would have bought this if I had known.";Has Major Flaw-Buyer Beware
4;10.0;1.0;7.0;I really regret buying this. It doesn't have bluetooth or the capability to connect to my devices over wireless for anything other than music. If I want to use my dvd player or chromecast with my computer to watch Netflix etc, the sound comes out of my tv or projector not the soundbar. I've contacted support a few times to see if there's any additional cables or adapters that I can buy to connect the system and they've never been helpful. Total waste of money.;Does not connect with Computer, Chromecast, or Home Theater.
94;11.0;1.0;53.0;Until this Playbar can support DTS audio, it should be considered a waste of money.  For $700 it should at least have more inputs and audio codecs for a soundbar.  My Samsung E450 soundbar (worth $200) has more inputs and codecs than this thing.  For a company that prides itself in modern audio technology, it sure lags behind much cheaper products like the $300 5.1 VIZIO soundbar (per CNet).  If I was simply buying this for music I would rate it 4 stars, but Sonos endorses this as a home theater system, so until they fix this, it's garbage.;Doesn't Support DTS Audio = Not a Real Home Theater Soundbar
22;12.0;1.0;25.0;I've tried to give it some time (7 months to be exact), but the Sonos system hasn't worked right since I purchased.  The audio constantly drops, and they've been trying to figure out what's causing this even though they've said they're working on an update with Samsung for the 8000 series for months.  This is a 2016 model.  Be hesitant if you own a Samsung.;Doesn't work with new Samsung TV's
39;13.0;1.0;33.0;Disappointing soundbar. Thought it would be a great purchase and am already invested with a bunch of other Sonos gear. Bought the Playbar and two Play:1s since Sonos says they can work together to do 5.1 surround. Turns out the Playbar doesn't support DTS and because it only has optical in (no HDMI ARC) it can't even support Dolby Digital Plus. So the $700 Playbar 90% of the time is playing 2-channel PCM stereo while my $199 soundbar downstairs plays every format I throw at it. After reading the Sonos support forums it appears DTS would be an easy software upgrade which has been requested by tons of their users, but Sonos refuses to do it. Pretty disappointed all around with both product and company after that.;Not worth it even if you already have a bunch of Sonos gear
95;14.0;5.0;43.0;"If you're like me, you have probably scoured the Internet looking for the best over all soundbar, with the best value for the money. Something that will give you as close to a actual surround sound experience as possible, but be aesthetically pleasing enough to keep the wife happy. I can honestly say that the Sonos Playbar is it for me.\n\nI recently purchased the Playbar and have it connected to a blu-ray, xbox, and cable box.\nWhile I do think a Sub would make it sound even better, I have to say that I am extremely happy with the quality the soundbar alone gives. The sound quality is amazing! Nice, clean detail in the audio, with a great low-end without a sub. The speech enhancement feature is great for sports or content with a lot of dialogue, and the bar programs to your existing remote perfectly. The set up is cake and the size/look is perfect for my entertainment stand.\n\nI have owned a Sonos Play3 for over a year now and am totally sold on the way they perform. I mean, bluetooth is great, but Sonos is a far superior product to your average bluetooth speaker or soundbar. Quality, content, range, expandability, independent room control. It's all there with Sonos. I knew that I wanted to incorporate this into my home theater system as well, but I initially had some concerns with the Playbar.\n\nIf you have done your research on this soundbar, then you probably have heard of the complaint that it only has one optical input and makes you pass all of your audio through your T.V. when using multiple sources. Most all T.V.'s can only output a PCM(digitally processed) audio signal, which basically means you're losing a good bit of quality. This comes into play majorly if you want true channel separation or are looking to incorporate a sub and rear channel speakers to this system. While, you may be happy with the quality you get by connecting the soundbar this way(it's certainly going to be far better than any T.V. speakers), I wanted to use this soundbar to it's full potential.\n\nThe solution? Get yourself a optical switcher that will let you bypass the T.V. and run all of you sources directly to the switcher. The output of the switcher will run to the soundbar, giving you amazing audio. I purchased the C2G Toslink Digital Audio Switcher off of Amazon for $40. It passes full 5.1 audio, thus giving your playbar a true 3.0 signal to work with. Your channels will be separated, clear, and it makes a HUGE difference. If you decide to grow your system with a Sub and rear speakers, (which I do) this switcher will make an even bigger impact.\n\nNow, I've seen all the arguments....""I shouldn't have to buy another piece of equipment to make this $700 soundbar work"", ""Sonos should have designed it with more inputs"", and ""Sonos should have designed it to pass through HDMI.""\n\nThe thing is... if you don't like Sonos, you won't like a SonosPlaybar. Yes It would be nice if the soundbar had more inputs, but Sonos is a company that does quality through simplicity. iPads only have one connection on them as well, and you either are an Apple person or you aren't. It's not necessarily their fault that T.V.'s output a crap audio signal. As T.V.'s progress I'm sure that they will improve on this, but for now there is a easy way around it.\n\nFor me, it was worth spending an extra $40 to unlock the full potential of this soundbar that my T.V. was hindering.\nIf you haven't tried Sonos, I would highly, highly recommend anyone with a reliable Wifi connection to buy this soundbar.\n\nNow to start saving for the Sonos Sub.";If you love Sonos, this is the Soundbar for you.... and if you haven't tried Sonos... this is still the soundbar for you!
35;15.0;1.0;26.0;Optical port failed after 2 years. $175 for a reconditioned replacement. Not the quality I expect of a $700 speaker;Failed after 2 years
87;16.0;3.0;40.0;I have invested in a lot of Sonos products and have been happily using them for years now, but this is the first time I've had buyer's remorse.\n\nI bought the Playbar and two Play 1's to use as rear speakers for a surround setup. I A/B tested the setup using my existing tuner and traditional wired surround system and the Sonos rig stood up to the test. It was a little thinner and the spread was narrower, but the definition when it came to dialogue and music clarity were better with the Sonos setup. After a week of comparisons I decided to pull my wired system out of the room and remove my receiver so that I could set up the Sonos surround system as they suggest in the manual. This was when things started to fall apart.\n\nSonos wants you to connect the Playbar via optical Toslink directly to the TV, and run any external components through your TV. Unfortunately, due to DMCA copy protection regulation crap enforced by the big studios, almost no TVs pass Dolby Digital through the optical output. Only broadcast material that originates on the tuner inside the television will be heard in true surround sound. NO EXTERNAL SOURCES CAN BE HEARD IN SURROUND ON THE PLAYBAR IF CONNECTED AS SUGGESTED. This includes your cable or satellite box. ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF NEW SONY TVs PASS DOLBY DIGITAL THROUGH THE OPTICAL OUTPUT.\n\nIn order to workaround this problem I had to purchase a $60 HDMI switcher that breaks out Toslink audio and run that into the Playbar. This works, but it's a little ridiculous that I need to do something like this when I've just spent $1100+ on a surround system (I actually downgraded because I refuse to buy the Sonos sub to replace my wired one). I could also bring my receiver back into the mix but that seemed a little ridiculous as well for just breaking out the audio to optical. The whole point of this transition was to give up a little in surround quality for ease of use, digital music integration, and less clutter!\n\nI honestly am extremely puzzled by this design decision by Sonos, who is usually totally keyed in to user experience and excellent product design. I'm pretty bummed and wish I hadn't gone through with this.\n\nIf you don't care about surround, and just want improved stereo audio with Sonos quality and functionality, and are willing to pay a whopping $700 for it, then the Playbar is for you! But if this year's CES is any indication, there is about to be a whole lot of competition in the marketplace, and if I was you, I'd shop around a bit.;BEWARE: Not surround friendly!
6;17.0;5.0;8.0;I bought the Playbar because a friend recommended it. It sounded great! I bought the Sub to see how much it added. I'm totally in! I ordered two Play 1s for the surround the same day! Full surround for my living room.\n\nBut wait, what about my bedroom? Bought a Sonos One, sounded good, bought another: stereo! Try that with Echo.\n\nThen comes the kicker: TrueTuning! Bit more than a minute waving my iPad around while my Sonos Ones made strange noises and it literally transformed my bedroom into the best stereo image I've ever heard.  Did the living room next and not as much of a huge gain, but it sounded a lot better too!\n\nNow considering den TV.. :-) I purchased the products separately and too lazy to write reviews for all. Amazon will have to fight me if they want their products back!;Just buy it! You won't believe it! Please pay attention to their TrueTuning technology, it's a game changer!
14;18.0;5.0;15.0;I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this yet!  I hooked this up to my girlfriend's pair of Play 3's in her living room in order to set up [surround] sound for her TV/AppleTV.  We moved the 3's to rear surrounds and use just the Playbar under the TV.  I have to say, despite being an audiophile and knowing full well that Sonos doesn't come close to leading the pack in terms of raw fidelity... I almost don't care because they sound great and Sonos makes it sooooo painless to set things up.  Within moments (and virtually zero effort on our part), we had beautiful surround sound for movies!;Thumbs way up.
7;19.0;5.0;7.0;Awesome. The sound is incredible, the user interface and iPhone app work amazingly, and for my simple apartment setup the soundbar itself is *definitely* getting the job done. I'll eventually buy a set or two of the surround sound speakers, but for now it is nice to know that I have a nice, functional, wireless audio solution.\n\nTrust me when I say, as a person that makes software, it is not easy to make an app that works this well. Not needing to sync up with bluetooth is a God send, and with full Spotify integration I can queue up any music that I want to!;No more annoying bluetooth!

107;21.0;5.0;33.0;"I'm a long time fan of sonos, and this Playbar is a great addition. The sound is truly excellent and the full integration with my sonos system makes this soundbar unbeatable for me. I use it along with the Sonos Sub (which I didn't need, but which makes for a mind blowing combo with the playbar.)\n\nAmong the features I most appreciate are the following:\n\n- Sonos' ability to automatically revert to TV audio whenever the TV is turned on.\n- Enhanced Speech mode making TV dialog especially clear.\n- Late Night mode for softening louder sound bursts.\n- The ability to use my IR remote to control the volume, AND the great full featured sonos controller apps for iphone, ipad, osx, windows, android etc. (IMO the best remote control interface ever for internet radio and total music streaming)\n\n- Access to all my iTunes tracks, playlists, albums, artists, automatically updated every night.\n- Streaming of 100,000 radio stations, so easy to to find and use with the sonos controller apps\n- Pandora, Rhapsody, Spotify, and just about any other music service you could want. (I'm using Pandora and Rhapsody)\n- Streaming of custom web sites by use of any streaming URL. (I use these for my JazzRadio.com stations.)\n\nIMO, these features make the Playbar a great choice for people new to Sonos, and an obvious one for those who already have sonos.\n\nA SOLUTION for DOLBY DIGITAL WITH PLAYBAR and ANY TV\n\nSome folks have had issues in getting Dolby Digital from their TV optical out. Some older TV's have no optical out or no sound from their optical out when using HDMI, and some other TVs send only stereo to the optical out. See this sonos link for a list of TVs and their level of compatibility with the Playbar:\n\nsonos.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1931/~/television-compatibility-with-the-playbar\n\nA very simple, fairly inexpensive solution to all of these audio problems, and one which has been working extremely well for me, is an HDMI Audio extractor, sometimes called a de-embedder, combined (if you have more than one source) with a simple hdmi switch. (An audio extractor is around $40. Monoprice has a 4x1 hdmi switch for $24 OR an 8x1 switch for $79, and Amazon has some good hdmi switches as well)\n\nThis solution is ideal for folks like myself, who are already using an HDMI switch, or for those using only a single source (in either of these cases you'd only need to buy the $40 audio extractor).  But even if you'd have to buy an HDMI switch, this approach has some advantages over plugging all of your hdmi cables into the TV or using an integrated hdmi/optical switch:\n\n- You need to run only 1 cable (just an hdmi cable) from your equipment location to the TV location. (eg. you can keep the hdmi switch near all of your sources, route its output hdmi cable, under the floor and behind walls, to the tv, and insert the audio extractor right by the TV and playbar. Giving you a very short convenient run for the optical audio cable.)\n- Using a standalone HDMI switch, rather than TV switching, makes it much easier to add more sources in the future, eliminating difficult routing for the additional cables.\n- An integrated hdmi/toslink switch will not work for sources with no digital out, such as a Roku3.  This approach will.\n\nThe audio extractor I'm using is this one:\n\nJ-Tech Digital Premium Quality HDMI to HDMI + Audio (SPDIF + 3.5mm Stereo) Audio Extractor Converter .\n\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/B00BIQER0E/dp/B00BIQER0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">B00BIQER0E</a>\n\nYou just plug your switcher's (or single source) HDMI output cable into this device's HDMI input instead of the TV. Connect a second HDMI cable from the HDMI output of this device to your TV's HDMI input. Connect the optical output of this device to the Playbar. Press the button to choose Digital Out and you're done.\n\nI'm automatically getting dolby digital whenever my source has dolby digital, and stereo whenever my source has stereo. My picture quality and audio are excellent, and video audio sync is perfect. No problems of any kind. It's working well with my Roku 3, Apple TV, 2 Tivos, and a Sony BluRay DVD Player.\n\n(Note however that, as with every other device I've seen, this unit does not convert dolby digital plus or DTS to either vanilla DD or to stereo for the digital out. If you're getting DD+ or DTS you'd have to switch that off at the source. An example of this is Netflix whose surround sound is DD+ on Roku. Because of that, I have Roku set up to give me stereo from Netflix and DD 5.1 from Amazon. Sonos is said to be working on Playbar DTS support.)\n\nI'd seen a couple of suggestions for similar extractors but I had been unable to find reports from anyone who's USED one with the Playbar. So, if that has been holding you back, I hope this helps.";Love it: Here's a Dolby Digital Solution for ANY TV

I've also expanded with the 1's to make true surround.  If anyone is complaining about the true surround, they are cheap and need to invest a little but more.\n\nI was a Bose and BO guy  No more.  Too many features and great sound.";Five Stars
78;23.0;2.0;29.0;After a year or two of sitting on the sidelines, I've jumped pretty quickly into the Sonos ecosystem. I first purchased a Connect Amp to power my patio speakers, and then quickly decided I needed sync'ed audio throughout the house. I purchased a couple of Play 1 speakers initially for the game room and bedroom, and a Playbar for the main TV area. I'm very happy with both the Connect Amp and the Play 1 speakers. The Playbar is a different story...\n\nDon't get me wrong, the Playbar sounds and works great as a part of the Sonos whole home music system. Where it falls flat on its face is with its primary marketed use -- home theater 5.1 audio.\n\nThe Sonos forums, along with lots of other forums on the Internet, are quite literally FILLED with threads on how to get true 5.1 surround from the Playbar. That in and of itself is prima facie evidence that Sonos failed in their mission to make it simple. Sonos's general response is that it is the TV manufacturer's fault. However, Sonos either failed to do the research required to know most TVs don't pass 5.1 via the optical out prior to designing their product (which I find doubtful), or they simply didn't care.\n\nLeaving aside the most TV's not passing 5.1 on optical-out issue, the decision to not support HDMI input (which yes, would require a built-in HDMI switch, which yes, might add $50 to the cost of the components), actually makes the system FAR MORE complicated for people who care about true 5.1 surround.\n\nLike many Playbar owners in the forums, I too decided to try to find a workaround to the optical-out limitation. So I bought an HDMI switch with optical-out. You know what? It works like a champ, as long as the material I'm watching is encoded in DD 5.1. If it is anything else (DD+, DTS, etc.), I get no sound, because either the Playbar can't decode it, or it can't be sent via optical-out to begin with. The ultimate outcome is that getting 5.1 surround with any given source material is a low percentage crap-shoot highly dependent on the source device and the audio codec utilized. For example, try streaming Netflix from a Roku 3 to the soundbar (after you've purchased an HDMI switch with optical-out to make it even theoretically possible). The result? Silence on the DD+ 5.1 audio option, because that particular audio format is too bandwidth intensive to be sent via optical-out. Sure, I could buy a receiver or high-end Blu-ray player that would decode/transcode the source material and send it via optical-out in plain DD 5.1, but the Playbar is supposed to simplify things, not make them more complicated with more components.\n\nAs the world has clearly moved (past tense) to audio formats that can only be sent via HDMI, it appears Sonos released an already obsolete product in terms of home theater 5.1 surround sound. The fix is simple:\n\n1. Build a Playbar with 3 - 4 HDMI inputs and one HDMI output.\n2. Add decoding for all of the relevant, modern audio codecs (DD+, TrueHD, DTS, et al).\n3. Include a remote to switch between the HDMI inputs.\n\nThe end result? A system that just works for 95% of people looking for a simplified (no receiver) home theater setup, WITHOUT work-arounds that still don't address the increasing obsolescence of plain DD 5.1 to begin with.\n\nThe end result for me? As much as I love the Playbar as part of my whole home music system, I'm sending it back. Maybe I'll buy a Play 3 for the TV room in the interim, maybe not. I'll be in the market again, and first in line, when Sonos decides to do it right without flimsy excuses.\n\nIf you want true home theater surround from all supported sources (cable box, blu-ray player, streaming box) without a receiver, you don't want a Playbar. Sonos won't fix things until more people start voting with their wallets.;Sonos Great Overall, Playbar Greatly Disappointing

89;25.0;4.0;30.0;"I bought the Sonos Soundbar, the Sonos Subwoofer, and two Play:3 speakers as surround sound speakers.  The set up of the Sonos Soundbar, Subwoofer, and Play:3 speakers was very simple and took me about 25 minutes.  However, once I had it set up I noticed that the system was not transmitting true surround sound.  I learned after reading this review board and other review and message boards that the reason for this is Sonos wants you to use your TV as a hub, with all the inputs from your devices (Apple TV, Cable, etc.) going to the TV and then the optical audio out from the TV to the Playbar.  However, most TV's won't pass Dolby Digital (DD) 5.1 surround from HDMI to the digital/optical audio (i.e., the Playbar), so what you get in most cases is stereo with muted simulated surround sound that is NOT surround sound from your surround speakers. Unfortunately, there is no good list anywhere that I found listing TVs that actually do pass DD 5.1, but if you have a TV that does, you are good to go (I describe later in this review how you can tell if you are getting DD 5.1 or not).  However, if you are one of the many who do not have such a TV, you need a solution or you will not get DD 5.1.  After many hours of research, I tried (and was successful) with the following solution:\n\nI purchased a Shin Kin 4x2 Remote Control Digital Optical TOSlink Audio Fiber Optic Selector Switch Switcher Splitter (currently sold on Amazon for approximately $69.95).\n\nI connected each of my devices (I have Apple TV and DirectTV) to the ""Optical Input"" switches (called Input 1 and Input 2) on the Splitter via a Digital Optical Audio Toslink Cable (i.e., same type of cable that came with your Sonos).  This will take care of sound (and you will leave your HDMI cables connected to the TV for purposes of transmitting the video signal from your devices).\n\nI connected the Sonos Soundbar to the output (called the ""Output 1"") on the Splitter.\n\nImportant - Make sure the sound settings on apple TV/your cable box/other devices are set to Dolby Digital (I had to make this change before I was able to get 5.1).\n\nThen enjoy.\n\nYou can confirm that you have properly set things up in Sonos - go to ""About My Sonos System"" in the ""Settings"" menu, and if you look at the Playbar detail, it should read ""Dolby Digital 5.1"" - if it does not (i.e., if it shows ""Stereo""), either the show you are watching is not Dolby Digital or you have not connected things properly.  This is also how you check and see when you first power up your Sonos system whether your TV transmits DD 5.1.  Try a few HD channels, as the message regarding what the Sonos is transmitting will change depending on whether the show/movie you are watching is DD 5.1 or not.\n\nAlso - I have a Harmony Logitec remote.  I was able to add the switch I to the commands for my remote so I now can switch between channels on the switch using my remote and turn it off and on via my Harmony remote.  Someone had posted the manufacturer name and model number in the reviews for the switch I bought but so everyone has all the information in one place to implement this solution, the manufacturer of the switch that I bought here on Amazon is Shin Kin and the model is AOS-42TR-B - if you use a different switch you will need to get the manufacturer and model number for your switch and program it in the Harmony settings.  You can also add your Sonos Playbar to the devices your Harmony Logitec remote recognizes and control the sound through your Harmony remote.\n\nNow that I have the system set up, it sounds great and the DD 5.1 sounds awesome for movies/shows/etc. that are in DD 5.1.\n\nBut for having to spend many hours finding this solution and paying additional $ for the switch, I would have given the Playbar a 5 star review - it sounds that good.  Good luck and enjoy!";Great Product, once you solve the 5.1 Surround Sound Issue (and here is one solution that worked for me)

19;28.0;5.0;13.0;I could never picture myself laying down the kind of money that Sonos commands for their systems but did just that recently and glad that I did. I've had a Play 1 for some time now and found it to be an enjoyable simple and easy to use addition. After using a name brand 5.1 surround home theater system for several years and unable to get it to work properly with all of my streaming devices for reasons beyond my scope I decided to make the jump to Sonos. I purchased the Playbar, the Sub and an additional Play 1 to complete a 5.1 system. It's great! Sonos makes it so simple and without all the wires stretching out everywhere and an easy 'true tune' to the room setup and it's 'heaven'. The Sub is connected directly to my tv with no tweaks or extra buttons to push to activate streaming devices properly. It fills my bedroom with the incredible home theater sound and bass that I'd been looking for.

The remote for the cable box easily adjusts the volume for Sonos so if you are worried about that, you don't have to be.  I also use the Playbar for music when the TV is not on and it sounds great.  Minor issue is the sound doesn't sound as loud as my Play 3s and 5s.  Also, at first I thought the sound was not exactly synced to the people on the screen.  So looked like bad lip syncing but it actually went away so either I got used to it or it corrected itself within a day or two.;Sonos speakers are like crack!!
85;30.0;2.0;27.0;"The point of the soundbar is to declutter your hometheatre.  Separate components of a 5.1 receiver and a sonos:connect will provide better sound for less money.  So the main reason to buy this product is that it simplifies and declutters while providing a similar sound quality.\n\nUnfortunately, by design it cannot do a very good job of the 5.1 part.  The way it is meant to be used is to be plugged into your TV, so that it can amplify the audio for what you are watching.  Unfortunately, almost no TV on the market can provide the 5.1 sound input the playbar requires.  Without a 5.1 input, the playbar cannot provide 5.1 output.  This is not a fault of the playbar, but of the HDMI spec; it can be read to prohibit TVs from providing the output the playbar needs.\n\nIn order to get the appropriate input to the playbar, some sort of HDMI switcher is needed, but now you are adding clutter to satisfy the needs of a product meant to declutter.\n\nSonos knows all of this of course, yet still markets this as a painless upgrade.  I find that very misleading.";Misleadingly marketed

115;33.0;5.0;25.0;"I don't consider myself ""harry homeowner"" when it comes to electronics or sound. I do a lot of research and will put money into something if I believe it is a good product.  I had read a ton of reviews about this product both from Best Buy, Crutchfield, and here on Amazon. It was very difficult to find anyone that would give it less than five stars.\n\nAlthough I had prewired my house for surround sound, I do have one room where there is just a flat-panel TV and I had zero interest in running any kind of wires behind the wall or making a mess. That is when I started looking into the sound bars. In years past it is also been impossible to find a good sub woofer that could wirelessly handle any kind of sound and come out as a good product. So I ended up going to Best Buy to get a demo of this and see if it is what I was looking for.  The other bonuses for me was I want to be able to extend this system throughout my house on a need by need basis, and I also have an iPad and iPhone and like the idea of being able to control my entire electronics life with one device.  Visually...not a universal remote.\n\nNeedless to say the demo sold me. I want out of there with a sound bar, a sub woofer, And a bridge-a necessary component if you want to link everything together like I want to. I cannot say enough about the ease of hooking all of this up. An elementary school student could do it. I give it five stars alone for the entire process out-of-the-box. I have now had it up for about 15 hours in have used the crap out of it. Both playing very high sound intensive movies, watching a hockey game, and streaming music from both Pandora, XM radio, and even local radio stations.  This entire system reminds me very much of Apple. Extremely powerful and yet unbelievably simplistic. And yet has enough technical aspects to it To keep a person like me entertained and give me a ton of cool options to configure.\n\nOn the iPad app alone you can individually control speakers, sounds in individual rooms, move from program-to-program, all with a touch of a button.\n\nThe salesperson at Best Buy joked with me and said you'll be back in a couple months to add on to your Sonos system. I chuckled but not only do I think he's right but I'll probably be in quicker.  Awesome sound, quality, and product.";Wireless Sound Perfection....Finally

You definitely get what you pay for with this system and I would whole-heartedly recommend it.  If nothing else, the setup is worth the purchase.  It was easy enough that Joe Biden could do it. And frankly, it was fun!  I can just picture Joe walking around his living room, grinning from ear to ear, as he goes through the tuning process.  Man I love that guy.;Very good.

17;37.0;3.0;10.0;"This is a hard review for me to write- mostly because I have some very strong, very conflicting feelings on the Playbar and Sonos in general.\n\nFirst the general context of where I'm coming from- in addition to being the person who most cared/knew the most about speakers, amps, etc of all my friends and family I also spent nearly 2 years recently working for a very high end Home Theater and Home Automation company. What do I mean by high end? It means although way, way outside my price range I regularly heard music demos of some highly regarded equipment from B&W, McIntosh, Focal, Martin Logan, AudioQuest. Hell we even had audiophile grade (and $23,000 a pair) Magico S3s powered by Aesthetix Atlas Amps in our showroom. Point of this long winded story is that I've heard some of the ""best"" (very subjective term) that the audio world had to offer- but I can tell you that the number one brand we sold (for distributed audio was Sonos. Sonos was so far ahead of the game- easy to use app (better than the home automation software we sold), rock solid flawless reliability, flexibility, and wireless performance (the only wireless brand we ever ever considered), plus they sounded good, really good. And when I say really good I mean for most people (including myself) that would hear them would concede that the Sonos sounded almost as good (audiophiles would disagree), or at least good enough, to compete with the speakers that cost several (or even back to back with a pair of much more expensive speakers, and at a fraction of the price, were downright amazing. I was completely sold on Sonos and seemed like they'd be set to totally kill off the old established brands- it was only a matter of time. In the summer of 2015 I took the plunge and purchased the whole 5.1 Playbar system.\n\nOver the next two years I had some very high highs and some very low lows with this system before finally setting off my whole Sonos system earlier this month. Here's why-\n\nThe good:\n-Very good sound, especially for music.\n-Paired with a Sonos Sub the bass is incredibly tight and deep. Not boomy, not boxy, you feel it. The most immediate standout feature of the sound.\n-Paired with 2 Play-1s as rear speakers you had a huge sounding surround sound experience and a much bigger sound for music too.\n-Dead simple to setup, rock solid performance.\n-All the streaming services I use (plus dozens more)\n-App is well designed, snappy, easy to use. The absolute best out there.\n-Stunning industrial design (as good as Apple).\n-Truplay (which was just released for 5.1 setup) was seriously amazing. Expected some nice tweaks, got a way way wider soundstage. No clue how Sonos is doing this, but it was a startling difference.\n\nThe bad:\n-Sound is not as good for movies. Don't get me wrong- with a good 5.1 mix, it sounded completely bad ass. But vocals could get lost in the mix. There is a vocal boost mode (changes EQ and boosts center channel) along with a night mode (compression). MOST issues with movies were fixed with this combo, but not all and you had to compromise dynamic range and tonal balance often just to make some movies and TV shows watchable.\n-Stereo signals lack midrange. Not sure why it sounded so great with stereo music but with stereo sources off Netflix, Youtube, etc definitely had a slightly muddy, hollow, boomy sound. Truplay made a big difference with this- but it was annoying how great it could sound for one movie or show, or how distractingly muddy on others even on the same service. I tested with differing headphones etc to see if this was just the recording, but something about the way the Playbar processes stereo just seems off.\n-Surround channels always sounded muffled in surround sound to some extent. Even after Truplay the rear Play-1s always sounded best with sound effects, ambient noise and music. When there was audible speech these always sounded more muffled than the Playbar.\n\nThe ugly:\n\nSo this is the crux of everything- the sound issues good or bad are subjective. I think anyone who listens to the Playbar will think it sounds awesome- and for the most part it does. But the one thing though that seriously ruined this experience for me enough to have me sell my Sonos- the optical port. I know I know- everyone complains about this, but this is the achilles heel and boy, what a heel. Why is this so bad? Well like I've outlined the Sonos sounds the best in 5.1 with a good mix, in fact it sounds stunning lin 5.1 most of the time. But it really really doesn't sound that great in Stereo, regardless of the source. As many people outlined here- lots of TVs only pass stereo through their optical ports- but yeah no issue get a optical splitter or HDMI switch with optical audio extractor. There are tons of these on Amazon and you can find 2-3x of these that are reasonably priced that people recommend, and hey you can use a Logitech Harmony remote for an elegant solution to control your TV, Playbar, switch, AppleTV seamlessly! All true, if it were only that easy. For sources I had an AppleTV and a PS4. Depending on the source, and the material, and the streaming service, and the audio switch I was trying at the time- things would work great, and then not at all, or sound terrible with one thing, and great with everything else. Because Sonos is so amazing in so many way I found myself, like a lot of people, being an apologist for it's lack of options or consistency here and I tried many many things, spent not that much (but too much) time and money trying to ""fix"" this issue and ""make this work"". Unfortunately this came to an abrupt head over the last few months. The sound on the Playbar started audibly stuttering, clipping, and momentarily dropping out on seemingly random movies, TVs and shows. I poured over forums, emailed and called support, got a new AppleTV, got new cables, got new boxes to switch the signal- but this was not a problem that could be ""fixed"". In fact I believe there was nothing wrong with my Playbar at all, or at least it wasn't ""broken"". Maybe it was a software update on Sonos' end, or maybe netflix or HBOgo's end, but wherever it was coming from it seems to have come from (although I guess I cannot say for sure) from the Playbar trying to unsuccessfully decode Dolby Digital+ signals, glitching out and staying that way (the only fix was hard reboots of the Playbar, this would happen at random points, and sometimes not at all). The thing here was there was no good option to fix this, and I couldn't make it stop happening no matter the settings, and it was driving my fiancee and myself completely up the wall. In my opinion by keeping the ethos of being simple so high on the priority list, to the point of stubborn refusal to adapt (how many people have asked even for a single HDMI pass though or ARC on an updated Playbar?) Sonos is unfortunately making itself both way ahead of the game in some ways, but completely obsolete in others, and it's heart breaking.\n\nAt the end of the day- with all the things they do so much better than anyone else- I'm waiting, patiently, and hopefully not in vain, for Sonos to come back and update their line (and philosophy) so I can jump back in down the road. In meantime I can say that in a lot of ways Sonos was the best sound system I've ever owned, but also the most frustrating.";Amazing product with a fatal flaw
13;38.0;1.0;9.0;I bought a Play:1, a Play:3, and a PlayBar and set them up in 3 different rooms. The app often cannot find any of them, and when it can find something it finds a random single speaker instead of all 3. This problem happens on multiple phones, and their feedback is to reconfigure the speakers, which only solves the problem for a short time.\n\nAs for sound quality, the speakers that are part of my TV are better for watching TV and movies, but the SoundBar is better for music.;Save your money, Sonos devices don't work consistently.
71;39.0;1.0;19.0;Lack of DTS support for these speakers is a fatal flaw of this device if planning a 5.1 surround sound setup.\n\nConnecting this up to most televisions directly will never provide a true 5.1 surround experience.;Good speaker if you never intend to use it in a surround sound configuration.

Took me about 5 min tops to have everything working after necessary updates are applied and I was instantly blown away. The sound this bar produces is crisp & clear... It engulfs you like no other sound bar I've experienced. I immediately ordered another Play 1 to compliment the Play 1 I already own, Setting them up as rears for a 5.1 set up minus the sub (5.0?).

70;42.0;4.0;18.0;"I'm not an audio expert, but I can add perspective to your decision.  My qualifications-  I have 2 Sonos Play 1's, 1 Sonos Play 5, a Playbar and a sub.  Obviously I like the product, but it isn't for everyone.  And, Sonos creates it's own ecosystem-  so once you start down the Sonos road, don't expect to stray to other paths.  I started with 1 Play 1 one year ago.  Either you commit to the product line (or maybe just one room) or don't even start.  Sonos has a great software (music management) system.  But it only works with Sonos speakers.  Don't expect to integrate any of your existing audio components (I can't comment on the ""connect"" but my experience with Sonos is that you use non-Sonos products at your own peril).  The software has to be used to be appreciated.  It will find almost all of your music anywhere (as long as it's digital)-  on your PC, network, MAC, or Cloud.  If you want to listen to your DVD's or vinyl, they will have to be converted to digital somewhere on your network.  But it will find and organize all your digital music.  Plus, you can add Spotify, Pandora, Radio Paradise, Sirius, etc, along with countless radio stations.  I use mine mostly with my music collection and Spotify Premium (it would be a shame not to take advantage of premium after shelling out so much money for Sonos).  I really love the Play 1s-  each has only one speaker and limited bass,  but the separation, size and cost all make them my favorites.  I use the one Play 5 in the kitchen-  5 speakers (that's what the numbers refer to), but bigger, more expensive, and really no separation with just one.\n\nOK-  so now on to the Playbar-  the subject of this review.  It's the most expensive and most frustrating of all the Sonos products I have encountered.  Simplicity is a big selling point for the set up of Sonos as you have undoubtedly read.  And it is simple.  But when it comes to the Playbar, a little simplicity is at the expense of any versatility.  A cheap soundbar has more engineering flexibility than the Playbar.  It is only compatible with ONE optical input from the TV.  Forget about HDMI.  You cannot hook up any component other than one optical input.  Sonos will tell you that isn't a problem-  simply connect any HDMI component to your TV HDMI inputs and then connect your TV optical output to Sonos.  Sonos won't tell you upfront that your TV may simply not be compatible at all-  even if it has optical output.  This is apparently the case if your TV is more than a few years old and copyright issues prevented the component inputs or HDMI from being compatible to the optical output.  So, you won't hear any sound from any other component if it's HDMI into your TV, and even the television sound via optical input is garbage.  You can use those components only with the TV's original speakers (which defeats most to the purpose of buying a soundbar).  After a few hours of complete frustration, you will find on the Sonos website a discussion of the problem, a list of some of the televisions that won't work, a disclaimer that Sonos can't tell you all the TV's that may not work,  and a brief note telling you that there is no solution (in most cases).  So, I was about to send it back when a good friend of mine with far more tech savvy came over to see for himself.  After about 15 hours of trial and error, I can tell you that if you have other equipment with optical outputs, there are ways around this compatibility dilemma (and I have a 7 year old Sharp).  Why Sonos doesn't explain these solutions is mind boggling.  I can only assume they think people buy the Sonos for simplicity and would rather buy a new TV than figure out settings on their equipment. The Sonos manual contains less info than the back of a box of cereal.  Or Sonos arrogance precludes it from adding HDMI or being explicit about the limitations.  If TV manufacturers ever stop adding optical outputs and move strictly to the higher quality HDMI, then the Playbar will be worthless.  Either there are complex engineering restrictions that limit Sonos to optical, or the fault lies in product arrogance. (And, in my opinion, Sonos is at risk of going the way of Betamax).\n\nEnough about technology-  what about sound?  Of course sound is really too subjective for you to take someone's opinion without listening to the Playbar yourself.  But the consensus among my family and friends is that the sound quality is ""competitive.""  Not better than other high end speakers, but not worse either.  There is no question that the  Playbar has limited bass (maybe not as limited as the Play 1 or Play 5).  So, plan on buying the sub woofer-  you really have no choice if you want the most out of the Playbar as a home theater medium.  So now add another $699 to the cost of any of your home theater system.  I would say that almost everyone will be able to find traditional speakers that are at least as good as Sonos at less cost.  So, figure that you are probably paying a 30% (+ or -) premium for the Sonos software.\n\nSo why 4 stars?  I have never found listening to my music collection easier or more enjoyable.  I'm even happily paying for premium Spotify and Pandora.  The Playbar is the least favorite of my Sonos speakers based upon sound (you really have to buy the sub) and the tech issues I encountered probably would have been a deal killer had I known about them. Then again, I don't want two sound systems (music and home theater) in one room.  So, I have become a Sonos household.  But I really have to buy a new TV soon.";Sonos Arrogance Will Eventually Have Consequences

60;45.0;5.0;16.0;"Sonos is legendary for a good reason - because they really produce these components for the discerning consumer as well as for the neophyte looking for new sonic frontiers...\n\nIt all started when I bought the LG ND8630 (the white washtub Airplay speaker). I loved the Airplay ability, the looks, and the deep sound. Now discontinued, it is a killer speaker for a killer price. Then, I happened to drop into a Bose store (big mistake), and walked out with the Gold Standard of wifi-speakers, the Bose Soundtouch 30. Wow, this has the ""Bose Sound"", deep with crisp highs and an OK interface (I hated the limiting 6-favorite Bose app) that worked with Airplay, Spotify Connect, and aux inputs. It is the best in a single speaker one can find, in my mind, for $500. The Bose was King of my music experience at home...but something was missing...\n\nComparing the Bose 30 with the Bose QC15 headphones, I noticed what most (if not all) wifi- or wireless speakers were missing - the ambience of stereo separation! Music is produced with a lot consideration about how the track will sound in a stereo environment; the typical wireless speaker mixes or blends the two channels together - by virtue of the fact that any left-right channels are only inches- to two feet apart. Sounds great but is hardly a listening ""experience"".\n\nSo, I noticed the Sonos Play:1 world. I had not given Sonos any consideration because i was not into the ""music in every room"" advertising approach. With caution, I bought a single Play:1 and liked the deep sound from a relatively small coffee-can sized speaker. Wow, then I discovered that by adding a second Play:1, I could easily make these into a left and right stereo pair, over wifi and with zero expertise, they just worked!\n\nFor only $400, I had a pair of totally wireless speakers that filled the living room with the most amazing sound. I had been missing the true ambience of songs by playing Apple Music and Spotify, Amazon, Google Play, and Pandora over a single speaker. Note that compared to the Bose Soundtouch 30, each individual Sonos Play:1 could not match its presence, but together, the Sonos Play:1 pair just killed the Bose, sad to say! Rich bass (go figure!) and crisp highs, they sound great. Every playlist on every service was a new experience.\n\nThanks for reading to this point. So, I thought...I went from 1-D sound (on the wireless speakers) to a much richer 2-D stereo sound with the Sonos Play:1 pair, why not expand into 3-D sound with the added Sonos Playbar? Yes, it is $699 but I had spent double that much of goofy surround systems, subwoofers, and gadgets. So, Amazon delivered the Playbar (1-Day shipping!) and I plugged it in. The iPhone Sonos app is an example of simplicity and yet flexibility (learn this lesson, Bose!) and within a minute I had a true surround system! It uses your old TV or Cable remote for volume, has an IR-repeater strip across the back, in case the Playbar blocks the TV remote, has only a power cord, an optical connect to the TV, and an ethernet cable for the connectivity to the Play:1 pair. It uses its own wifi band so it offloads any wifi traffic over this completely wireless surroundsound system. Amazing! BTW, did you know that many of the commercials have incredible 5.1 DD sound! Imagine that shock. Yes, most modern TV's do throughput 5.1 Dolby digital over the HDMI-optical pathway. Yes, Comcast and Dish do broadcast most shows and movies in 5.1. And yes, the Playbar-Play:1 combo is incredibly lifelike. You have number of variables, like the surround and ambient effects, the rear speaker adjustments, and a sound calibration with the TV volume (I left my TV speakers disconnected). The Playbar comes on with the TV and shuts off with the TV. I don't even have to think about it...easy!\n\nBut wait, there's more! Using the iPhone Sonos app (...now I found the perfect solution for an old iphone or ipad laying about...!) I played my Spotify playlists over the Sonos Playbar-Play combo. WHOA. Amazing sounds, not only left- to right but also across the room. The playbar sits in front the TV while the Play:1's sit behind the sofa. The sound is very airy, and each instrument appears in different parts of the room - eery! It's more like an expanded sound field across the room, even for the standard mp3 two-channel streaming files.\n\nSo, what have I got? A killer surround system that just works ( I decided against getting the SUB woofer from Sonos for now) in addition to a very fascinating room stereo experience. The Sonos combo knows if content is 5.1 and if so, the rear channels play the surround information, otherwise, it fills the room with the Left-Right stereo content.\n\nWhat about my gripes? I thought I would hate the app as much as I had no love for the Bose app. Actually, the Sonos app has a lot to offer; each Sonos playlist can contain content from each or any of the music services you have, all rolled into one playlist. So, until Sonos supports Apple Music, I am stuck to iTunes content that I have downloaded onto my iPhone or iPad. Cmon, Apple and Sonos - fix this! I wish the Playbar would recognize more than 5.1 (I don't think DTS is supported). Before you buy the Playbar, MAKE SURE: your TV has HDMI inputs for each of your devices such as cable, PS3, PS4, etc. Make sure your TV can support 5.1 over the HDMI and then out to the Sonos on the optical SPDIF output. Make sure, you can plug the Playbar into an ethernet router in the room, so that the Sonos combo can operate on its own net. You cannot play the Playbar and both rear Play:1's only on the local wifi network, you have to use a Bridge, Connect, or the Playbar through the router. I think...\n\nSo, get these components and experience the best in 2-D and 3-D sound. I'll add more as I gain insights.";Sonos is a new music experience!
128;46.0;5.0;22.0;"Wow, the SONOS PLAYBAR is exactly what I needed.  Not only did it allow me to add another outstanding speaker to my ever growing SONOS home network, but it massively cleaned up and improved my Home Entertainment setup.  Prior to this solution, I had 3 separate bulky speakers resting below my TV that distracted from how cleanly my TV was mounted on the wall - like a picture frame with no visible cables.  Now, I have two components mounted to the wall with no visible cables and all the audio I can handle (see my picture above).  Setup was a breeze - I simply plugged the power cable in and routed the supplied fiber optic cable from the PLAYBAR to my TV.  That's it - done!  I was required to run a system update which auto-prompted and took little time to install.  After that, I was up and rockin'.  Audio sounded amazing through the SONOS network and I was able to get ""surround"" sound while watching video through my TV.  The TV audio was night and day compared to the TV speakers and was comparable to my previous setup (just looked better and cleaner). I should also mention that with my previous setup I needed a receiver to play audio through my 3 separate speakers.  I was experiencing issues with that setup because my receiver was in an enclosed cabinet below the TV and got really hot - to the point that I needed to keep the doors open when the equipment was powered on.  SONOS solved that major issue for me - I ditched the receiver since all audio comes from the TV directly to the speaker now and I no longer have heat issues!!!\n\nThe listening experience was great, but I wanted more.  So, I moved my SONOS SUB from my front room to my TV room and added two PLAY 3s for rear channel/surround.  I will tell you this right now - if you purchase the PLAYBAR and don't yet have the SUB, you need to purchase the SUB too.  The SUB topped the system off and is a natural pairing to the PLAYBAR.  It filled in the lows while listening to music and brought the rumble while watching TV/movies.  I'm not getting dedicated rear audio to the PLAY3s - they are more providing fill noise that helps equal out the sound in the room.  This setup will make you happy.  No wires to run and full surround.  It really can't get any easier than this.  I highly recommend this setup - you will be happy, as am I.\n\nHere is my current SONOS home network:\nFamily Room - PLAY5\nKitchen - PLAY5\nLiving Room - PLAYBAR, SUB and 2 PLAY3s\n\nWhen I group all rooms, I get an audio experience like no other.  I can crank it up and shake the walls with ultra clean sounding audio, or I can play at a moderate volume that doesn't distract from conversations during gatherings yet allows an even distribution of audio that everyone can hear.  The best part is that setup took little effort and I can move speakers around anytime I'd like with ease.";Simple, clean setup and mighty sound.

I'm glad I tried it out, because I almost dropped $3,000 kitting out my home with this system.\n\nIn theory, the Playbar is a godsend: hook it up to your TV via TOSLINK, hook all of your devices to your TV, and you're done. Even better if you already have a Sonos system for your music.  Given that my TV sits above a fireplace and I hate running wires, this should have been ideal.\n\nUnfortunately, the Playbar comes with a lot of caveats.  I have a lot of devices: a PS3, two different Xbox, and the cable box, all run through a Denon receiver and controlled by a Harmony remote. The receiver is a necessary evil:  with several HDMI devices, I don't want to run half a dozen wires to a TV above a fireplace. Trouble is, my Samsung TV--like almost every TV--downconverts any 5.1 audio from the TOSLINK to stereo. Sure, the Sonos then performs a make-believe 5.1 ""simulation"" on the resulting signal, but if I spend $700 for a playbar, $50 for a bridge, and $600 for two Play 3's for back-channels, I'd like real thing, thanks.  (If you have any interest in sound, you'll immediately be able to tell when the system is getting real 5.1, and when it's faking it.)\n\nSure, you can buy an HDMI splitter, connect that to an AVR, and then run the splitter's optical output to the Playbar.  Hope it works--but that rather defeats the whole ""simplicity"" point. And if you do adopt that solution, but have a Blueray player that gives a DTS signal.... you're out of luck, because Playbar doesn't do DTS.\n\nI suspect that Sonos' next offering will include something other than a TOSLink connection, because for $700, this kind of ""simplicity"" is insane.  Especially as Play-Fi options proliferate, Sonos will need better hardware and software to stay in the game.\n\n[UPDATE 3/7/05]:  I finally made the leap and purchased the Playbar, as I needed to upgrade my TV when the old one's capacitors blew out.  This device is as awful as I suspected.\n\nI have a new Sony XBR-55x850B, and I've spent two days trying to get the Playbar to operate.  I can get sound when I play a show in Netflix, but none of the TV's system sounds (like the click you hear when switching options on the menu) will work. Nothing will come through HDMI.\n\nI suppose that when it works, it's great, but if your TV/input device/SONOS systems don't get along, it's awful.";Waiting for the next version, which will hopefully be better
80;50.0;1.0;17.0;I have had a Sonos soundbar with Sub for a few weeks and on a regular basis the Sonos controller tells me I have no components at all.  The Sonos equipment seems to completely lose all information about its setup.  All that i can do is go through the complete set-up procedure again.  Very frustrating for such expensive equipment.;poor stability.  loses all information regularly
12;51.0;2.0;7.0;I bought this because everyone rated this so high.  The set up was super easy, easier than it should be, I was impressed.  The sound quality was on par or subpar, I think for an average or below average listener this PlayBar is loud, I got the Sub also (no base at all without a SUB), but it doesn't fill the room like other systems, and the overall quality is subpar, not as natural and crisp and room filling as it could be, and overly processed music gives it a very unnatural sound.  I returned this and bought Bose 300 w/Sub, what a difference.  The set up on the Bose was an hour long, horrific and and dreadful experience, I felt like it was 1998 all over again, Sonos definitely gets a star on this.  I am convinced that people rate this so high due to such easy set up, and not much on the sound quality.;Don't trust the hype, Bose 300 sounds better (set up on Bose is dreadful and you'll hate it)
86;52.0;1.0;17.0;Obviously this playbar is for people who do not know anything about true quality audio. Yes the playbar is easy to hook up. Yes  you can use their fancy app to control it. But, the crappy muddled sound and lack of HDMI makes this soundbar over priced. There are plenty of other soundbars that come with a subwoofer that are cheaper and sound a lot better. The playbar is $699 and the sub is another $699. That is $1400 for you to spend on an app experience. Cause that is all you are getting here for your money. I was so disappointed by the lack of quality in sound. All I've heard was how great Sonos is. Well, they are not impressive at all. Bottom line, the sound on this thing is not that good. There are way better sounding soundbars. Also, if you don't have a Sonos bridge, connecting it can be a pain if you don't have a network cable laying next to your tv. Save your money for a cheaper and better sounding experience. I promise you won't regret it. Unless all  you care about is the Sonos name and app. Then waste your money on this thing!;For the price it is overhyped!
104;53.0;1.0;18.0;I'e been using my LG HDTV model 47LG50 which was manufactured in late 2008 with other sound systems when I decided to buy the Sonos playbar per other reviews. It seemed like a great (albeit expensive) product. Unfortunately I couldn't get it to work with my older TV despite the fact that it is optical cable enabled and despite the fact their website said it would support this model of LG HDTV. I was very surprised by the fact that the Playbar took only an optical cable and not an HDMI. When the Playbar did not emit sound from either my TV, cable box, nor my blu-ray player I figured something was wrong. I tried their techinical support team with no luck. After a week of back and forth emails and calls they eventually suggested I buy an optical cable to HDMI converter to get it to work properly.\n\nYeah right. Here's your expensive Playbar back Sonos.;Better have the latest HDTV for this to work
0;54.0;5.0;18.0;"The sound on the Sonos Playbar is really good. It's designed super sleek and cool, and does a great job at ""fake"" surround. But it's a single bar, so it lacks the true surround sound that you'd get from having separate sub & speakers spread out, which you probably already know. If that's what you're looking for then look into true surround systems instead. Or, for an even bigger expense, it can be expanded to a true wireless 5.1 system by adding the Sonos Sub and two Play:3 speakers.\n\nThe connections provided:  a single optical audio input, a power port, and a pair of ethernet jacks. So, you can connect your home theater devices directly to your TV, then connect your TV's optical audio output directly to the sound bar. But if your TV lacks an optical audio output, then you'll run into a variety of complications. They're mostly *workable* complications, but just be prepared to deal with this as a hassle if you're lacking optical audio.\n\nYes, it's pricey. But, keep in mind that Harman Kardan's competing playbar is priced generally the same ($600 range), and this one comes equipped with Sonos' best in-class digital music software built in, Sonos Connect, which gives you access to your library of digital music (Amazon Cloud Player, Spotify, Pandora, and Rhapsody) through a simple interface. You can also sync it to other Sonos audio systems throughout your house. So, you're getting much more than just a playbar in this price. But keep in mind, you will need a device that is able to download the Sonos:Connect app in order to use as a remote to sort through your library. Compatable devices are iPod Touches, iPhones, iPads, and most smartphones and tablets.\n\nAnother thing to know in advance: Although the Playbar is technically wireless, at least one Sonos component on your network needs a wired, ethernet connection. You can purchase a Sonos Bridge for $50 to use the Playbar wirelessly, but when you're already putting out $600 for a ""wireless"" soundbar, this is something they should be more clear about.\n\nSonos has chosen not to provide a remote for setting controls, which is something a lot of people take issue with in other brands. But they do provide you with the ability to program it to your TV remote. I get it... Who wants ANOTHER remote to have to deal with? .. But, I had to go through a lot of troubleshooting in order to get the remote setup working correctly, provided by onscreen prompts and tips on their website. Once you get it setup, it will give you the option to set your TV to mute, which I recommend doing, unless you want an annoying echo. Other than a couple hang ups with the remote, setup was crazy easy.\n\nOnto the sound: for a playbar, it's pretty damn good. But, like I said, it's a playbar. It does its best to provide surround sound, but it's still a playbar and comes across a bit artificial and definitely lacks in the bass department.\n\nBut the sleek design with keyhole mounts provided on the back allow you to place it on the stand in front of the TV or -even cooler- mount it on the wall above or below. If you're looking for high quality surround sound that simultaneously provides the most simplistic, sleek look, you really can't go wrong with this playbar. And if you're interested in using it for listening to your digital music library through Sonos Connect (which is what I think is the best feature of this device), then you will be highly pleased with your purchase. As far as I know, there's not another audio system out there that provides surround sound for your TV with home theater connectivity AND audio streaming. (If I'm wrong about that, please feel free to correct me in the comments.)\n\nIf you're looking for the absolute most dynamic surround sound for your money... Well, then you're probably not looking at playbars in the first place.\n\nLet me end this review by disclaiming that I am not a sound ""purist"". Purists will grow tired of the sound on this playbar fast and will, I'm sure, be able to pick out many more audio flaws than I can. I think it sounds good, not amazing, but good... Especially for a soundbar. It's also innovative, well-designed, and provides two good audio functions with surround sound that you won't be able to find anywhere else on the market without spending more money. So, it all depends on what you're looking for.\n.";5 Stars for Sonos:Connect and Audio Streaming / 4 Stars for TV Surround Sound
20;55.0;1.0;8.0;"Here's why Sonos sucks:\n\nRestriction - The number one reason Sonos sucks is that YOU CANNOT USE IT AS A WIRELESS SPEAKER!!!  Want to quickly connect and play music from your laptop? Nope.  Want friends to be able to stream as well?  Nope.  Want to stream Spotify?  Sure - if you're a premium subscriber - otherwise?  Nah.  For $700, you expect to be able to use your speakers however you choose, but apparently Sonos management feels differently.  This, quite frankly, is some offensive BS.  I get it - software subscription and revshare models are great for the vendor - but having them forced on you as a customer buying a speaker is garbage.  What's next?  Is Lexus going to sell me a car and charge me monthly for data transfer from my wheels to my speedometer?  Will Apple begin charging monthly for data streamed from your phone to your watch?\n\nSound - Sound is ok, not great by any means.  My neighbor used to have a Martin Logan that sounded full and amazing.  I have a 55"" Sony XBR from ~2014, and the Playbar simply isn't much of an upgrade\n\nApp - The app is poorly designed and doesn't allow for much customization at all.  Clearly an app made by a hardware company\n\nOverall, I probably should have done more research, so I'll take responsibility on that front.  That said, Sonos is overpriced, over-constrained, and an overwhelmingly poor value and user experience.";Here's why Sonos sucks: Restriction - The number one reason Sonos sucks ...
129;56.0;5.0;17.0;"So I have been using Sonos products for 6+ years and I was dubious about the Sonos Playbar.  I have loved every Sonos product I have owned (2 zone systems, 2 Play 3s, Sub, 1 bridge) but the soundbar category is one that I haven't had a great experience with.  I was using a Sony soundbar that had really good reviews, but the sound didn't really impress me.  I didn't fill the room and their attempt at ""surround sound"" was clearly weak.\n\nI should have known that Sonos would change the game, as this soundbar CRUSHED my old system in terms of both setup and sound.  Let me start with the setup.  Sonos found how to bring their ease of setup for their zone players to my entertainment system.  I was prepared for a lot of punching in IR codes, etc, but I didn't have to deal with any of that.  It was as simple as plugging in the unit, plugging in the optical audio and then attaching it to my sonos system.  It walked me through setup in no time and the Playbar LEARNED my remotes rather than asking me to teach my remote to talk to the Playbar... this is how everyone should do it... SO EASY!  I then connected my Sub to the playbar and put on ESPN and immediately heard the difference.\n\nFrom a sound perspective you will always get better sound from a full fledged surround sound system, but my family room layout doesn't support a surround sound system, which is why I was previously using the Sony soundbar.  Having said that, the difference in sound between the Sonos playbar and my old system was immediately noticeable.  In fact, when my wife got home she walked into the room and asked what I did to improve the sound (she didn't know I had installed the Sonos Playbar).\n\nNow I am debating taking my 2 Play3s and using them for surround sound... but I am torn b/c we really love using those in the rooms they are in.  Maybe I will just go ahead and buy some more.\n\nOne last thing to note about the Sonos Playbar is that it has allowed me to take my zone system out of my family room and put it in another room because the sound from the Playbar is so good for music that it is both for our TV and for music in that room.";Another revolutionary Sonos product
50;57.0;1.0;11.0;"After spending a couple of hours trying to make sound come through the Playbar, I called Sonos to learn that my TV (a 2008 Samsung flatscreen) is incompatible with the Playbar. The reason, I believe, is ""TV fails to output audio from HDMI sources to optical output,"" based on the info in this list of TV compatibility issues from Sonos - https://sonos.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1931.  My model TV is not included on this list but the technician told me that any TV produced before 2009 would likely be incompatible with this soundbar and most others.\n\nIn many ways, giving this one star is unfair - I'm unable to judge the quality of this product because it won't work with my device.";Incompatible with TV
72;58.0;2.0;13.0;"Let's me start off by saying sound quality warrants a broad range of positive and negative reviews on nearly everything from low to mid to high quality products.  You can find someone ""poo pooing"" all over even $5,000+ systems.  I'm not an audiophile music nut but can appreciate a good quality product for music and movies.  That's what Sonos provides.  The audio is clear and beautiful.  However, if you are able to hardwire speakers and spend a bunch, this might not be a good fit.  For me, I had limited ability to subcontract out when my house was being built so I didn't want to punch a bunch of holes in the wall and snake near-endless wires around.\n\nSonos gave me exactly what I was looking for with minimal wires and superior sound for the amount.  Bose technology is not as innovative as it once was and Sonos provides equal or better quality for a comparable if not cheaper price.  I currently only have the playbar and subwoofer hooked up and the ease at which I can control everything through my iPhone is remarkable. I plan on adding two Play 1s when finances allow.  I can control the volume and stream music and internet radio with no fuss.  This product deserves 4-5 stars for what it is.  I will update this review when I buy the two additional speakers to add to a more balanced sound that is closer to surround sound. The two pieces I have now are very impressive products. Kodos to Sonos.\n\nUPDATE: 3/17/15\n\nI didn't want to heavily edit my previous review so you can see how things have changed for me.  I downgraded the star rating to two stars but could have given it a three as well.  My dissatisfaction with Sonos is largely due to its abysmal performance at producing the proper sound through my television.  I have last year's model for Sharp with their Aquos Q+ which is a superior television in my opinion and has some of the latest technology.  My current Sonos system consists of the playbar, subwoofer, and wifi extender. I have zero complaints in regards to the system producing top-notch sound when streaming anything over my iphone.  The issues arise with the television and the playbar's random flaws, which have become very annoying.  I have done the troubleshooting to correct issues and only short term relief has been experienced.  At first, I would get shows and movies in which the sound would drop out here and there for a few seconds at a time.  Now, I have constant variations with the sound levels once the television is turned on.  Additionally, I randomly get the wonderfully horrible ""robotic tone"" coming from actors talking and this can only be returned to normal when I change the channel and change it back.  Maybe these things can be fixed but ask yourself this: If you just spent over $1500 on a soundbar, subwoofer, wifi extender, did the recommended troubleshooting and still had issues, would you be fed-up?  I think so.  I am about to look into ebay for recouping my invested money.  I would never buy a Sonos product again until their wifi technology is better tested and works as it should.  They are a joke if they are trying to compete in their price range when there are these many issues.";Well worth the investment (at first)
28;59.0;1.0;8.0;Good product when it works.  Problem is they have the worst customer service imaginable.  My speaker worked for three months and then unexpectedly it stopped although I changed nothing related to connectivity.  I waited an hour and a half to talk to someone and then immediately got disconnect (I was on a hard line so doubt the problem was on my end).  Called back and customer service was closed.  Next day still had no luck.  I wish I could return it but now am stuck.  I should have stuck with Bluetooth.;No customer service
81;60.0;1.0;14.0;Be warned, the wireless signal interferes with TV broadcast signal. When I turn off the PlayBar, my TV signal returns.

Maybe, but now I'm stuck with an expensive boat anchor.\n\nIf I were warned I would not have purchased nor would I recommend for anyone using broadcast TV.;Does not work with broadcast TV!
10;61.0;5.0;5.0;I have this installed with the Sonos Sub woofer.  I am not certain how it sounds by itself, but with the sub woofer, it is AMAZEBALLS.  Sound quality is top of the line for the costs.  I recently moved out of my custom home and into a rental due to moving for a promotion.  My rental house was not prewired for surround sound.  So I was not going to spend the money on a house that wasn't mine to get surround sound.  My secondary options were a wireless soundbar and sub.  After testing most of what is on the market, the two brand that stood out the most for quality sound and price were the sonos system and the Bose SoundTouch 300 system.  Several audio video guys that I consulted said to stay away from the Bose.  General consensus was that bose hasn't really updated their technology in quite some many years and are spending more money on advertising then new products.  I honestly don't know, I was just impressed with the sound for the money.  Anyway, I went with the recommended Sonos system and have not been sorry at all.;AMAZEBALLS!!!
36;62.0;1.0;9.0;"Awful. I've had the Sonos system for two years. It seldom works correctly; there's always some minor issue. The aps, especially SiriusXM are faulty and do not allow you to listen to in-demand features or see all the data related to what you are listening to.

111;63.0;3.0;15.0;"I've had the Sonos Playbar for about five days now.  While that isn't a lot of time to generate a good option of the device it has allowed me to determine its pros and cons.  A little background.  The purchase of the Playbar accompanied the upgrade from a rear projection 46"" Toshiba with built in speakers to a Samsung 60"" ES8000.  Suffice it to say this is a major upgrade from a 7 year old system.  I had reservations going into the purchase of the Playbar after finding out that it does not support DTS out of the box.  Sonos's forums state that they are considering an upgrade.  However from a home theatre standpoint such an upgrade to supporting DTS is borderline pointless.  The Playbar only has optical in for a connection type.  Virtually no TV supports DTS output.  To make matters worse, which I found out after the purchase, AV receivers with very few exceptions do not support optical output either.  The end result being you have a heavily neutered system right out of the box.  The deal killer for me, and what is prompting me to return the device, was connecting an external Display Port laptop to the TV.  While I can covert Display Port to HDMI for video, this setup does not transmit audio across the connection.  The TV does not support a standard 3.5mm audio jack.  And the Playbar because of its nature does not have any type of input other than optical. I've had to connect external speakers to the PC to play content.  This is unacceptable.\n\nThis is Sonos's first foray into the home theatre market.  Until now their bread and butter has been providing solutions for playing multiple audio sources in multiple rooms in a home, of which as far as I can tell they have excelled at.  I can attest to the sound quality being fantastic.  If this was another speaker sitting on a shelf for Spotify I would have no problems singing the praises of this soundbar.\n\nHowever the thinking in design from home audio to home theatre audio did not change.  It's like fitting a square peg in a round hole.  Home audio is an ease of use, and quality speakers driven field, IMHO.  Home theatre includes this but also includes the need for flexibility since everyone's setup can be dramatically different, IMHO.  You take a look at any high end soundbar on the market today and the list where it only includes optical is very short.  I've read that Sonos's thinking was ease of use.  This works for Apple.  This does not work for the home theatre market beyond the handful of people who really don't care about anything other than enhancing the built in speakers included in the TV.  Going into this purchase I made the conscious decision that I was buying a system that was to last me around another 7 years.  This IMHO was not accomplished with the Playbar.  The Playbar's chief Pro's is that it's simple to setup, the audio itself sounds good, it's pretty, and it integrates well with online audio services.  The thing is I need more than that out of a component in a home theatre. I need the flexibility to be able to expand what is connected to my setup in the future.  The Playbar does not accomplish this.  I wish Sonos well.  I think they have major potential in this product, but whenever v2 comes out they need to add DTS support and HDMI input with an HDMI ARC output.";An audio centric company's first foray into the home theatre market
23;64.0;1.0;7.0;I own a Samsung UN55KS9500 Curved 55-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV (2016 Model).  Do not buy this Sonos PlayBar if you own a modern Samsung TV.  Your TV remote won't be able to control the volume on the Sonos PlayBar because Samsung remotes don't emit infared. Total bummer. I contacted Sonos customer support and they didn't seem to care that their product could not communicate with Samsung remotes, and didn't even try to offer a solution.;Don't buy this if you own a Samsung TV
34;65.0;5.0;8.0;"I'll admit, the Sonos Playbar is not cheap, and probably not the best value if you're concerned about ""bang for your buck"". However, if you're already using any other Sonos speakers in your home, and you're in the market for a sound bar, I don't know why you'd get anything else.\n\nThe Playbar hooks up to the optical output from your TV or home theater receiver, so you'll first want to make sure that you have an optical output. If you don't, the Sonos Playbar won't work with your TV.\n\nOnce hooked up, the Sonos app (I used the iOS app) walks you through the setup of the Playbar, which is just like any other Sonos speaker for the most part. The only difference is that the Playbar setup also takes you through a step where it learns the volume up/down controls from your TV. It then walks you through turning off your TV speakers. The idea here is that the Playbar replaces your TV speakers, but you can now control the Playbar volume from your TV remote as usual.\n\nOf course, as a Sonos device, you can still play streaming audio through it just like any other Sonos speaker, and you can group it with other Sonos speakers as well. The Playbar seems to do a really good job of figuring out what you're trying to do with it; I can be streaming music through it one moment, and then when I turn the TV on, it switches over to TV audio instead.\n\nThe Playbar is also pretty flexible in terms of placement. You can set it on a shelf, or with the separate wall mount bracket, you can mount it on the wall above or below your TV. With only two cables running to it (power and optical audio), it's also pretty easy to hide the cables.\n\nSound quality is excellent, and can be improved further by pairing it with a Sonos subwoofer. I haven't done that yet, because the Playbar alone is sufficient for my uses currently.";Best soundbar you can buy.

38;70.0;2.0;8.0;The sound is great and we invested in a sub woofer, too, which is great for watching movies, etc.  I was, however, very disappointed that it only allows you to play your music from their app.  We originally were going to use the Sonos system in our whole house, but the realized you don't have the total freedom to play everything you like from your device- only what Sonos allows. For example, you can only play Spotify if you pay for the premium service.  You also can't play music from other song sharing apps, etc.  I personally don't appreciate this kind of manipulation.  We eventually invested in a Bose.  The sound quality is not equal, but we have tons of Internet radio and music services accessible through their app PLUS. aux/ bluetooth that will play everything you can play through your headphones.

79;73.0;2.0;11.0;"First off, I am a big Sonos fan. I had toyed with the idea of purchasing a Playbar for some time. The idea of wireless rear speakers and sub combined with all the music streaming features Sonos offers was very appealing to me, even though it came with a high price tag.\n\nWhen I finally bought the Playbar, it was as quick and simple as it can be to set and I had great sound coming from my TV in no time. I added my two Sonos Play:1 speakers for 5.0 sound. When I played a Bluray disc with my PS3 I had no sound at first. This didn't shock me since I knew the Playbar does not support DTS sound and most Blurays are encoded with DTS. I changed the sound settings in my PS3 that it pass on only Dolby Digital 5.1 and PCM 2.0 as it is recommended by Sonos. After I did that, I had sound on all speakers, but it didn't seem like true surround sound. Checking the Sonos app confirmed that the input to the Playbar was Stereo sound. When I played the same scene in a foreign language, that is encoded in Dolby Digital 5.1, I instantly heard a significant difference and the Sonos app showed that the input is Dolby Digital 5.1.\n\nI am no expert in home theater electronics and standards. I assumed the lack of DTS functionality is something that is only of concern for audiophiles. However, it turns out that if you hope to get true surround sound, your source must be Dolby Digital 5.1. I have spent hours of research and troubleshooting with my hardware and have found no solution to this issue. This is in stark contrast to the ""simplicity"" approach of Sonos.\n\nSimplicity in setup and use does not exclude supporting more than one audio standard!\n\nWhile I would give any other Sonos device 5 stars, I can't give the Playbar more than 2. By itself it is a great device, which is reflected in all the positive reviews. But if you hope to get a great surround sound system when you couple it with two more Sonos Play:1 or Play:3 speakers, you will very likely be disappointed. It is beyond me why Sonos ignores an industry standard like DTS that is used by nearly all Bluray releases and any other modern $200 home theater system supports.\n\nPros:\n++ Easy Setup\n++ Music Streaming functionality\n+ Good soundbar for 3.0 configuration\n\nCons:\n--- Very limited support of audio standards\n--- No true surround sound for nearly all Blurays\n-- Only one Toslink input, so you need to rely on your TV to pass through Dolby Digital\n-- Expensive\n\nSo much potential, so poorly executed...";Great Soundbar unless you plan to use it in a 5.1 configuration
26;74.0;1.0;6.0;"1.  I bought an ""open box"" special which would only connect for the first stream then drop out after less than 2 minutes.  Unpower, repower, it comes back online for less than 2 minutes.  I have a 4-piece Sonos Play:1 setup which has zero problems of this nature.  I returned it after many hours of problems, because I didn't want to eat up my return window.\n\n2.  I bought a full price fresh unit from a major retailer.  After several hours of mostly TV watching through the optical audio with a lot of commercials forwarding, it cuts out, no sound.  Can't switch to streaming audio either.  Unpower, repower it comes back on.  Wife was on phone with Sonos customer service, but they said if we didn't repower it we could send the logs.  We'd have to call back when it cuts out.  It is working the rest of day day.  This morning, watching TV, it cuts out again.  I can see it in my Sonos Device list, but can't get any sound on it.  Wife is waiting for the Sonos callback -- but hard to keep a 5 year old occupied, because he's MAD his show was interrupted.  If they can't adequately explain and pinpoint the issue -- it's going back to the store for a refund.\n\nI'm connecting to Wifi with the bar.  I can speculate it's a networking issue with these sound bars, but Sonos has been tightlipped on the support forums.  (Not wanting to lose future sales, yeah, I get it, and am used to it.)\n\nI can speculate that maybe I need their network device to create a separate network, but for those who never have problems with this playbar, they have to have something in common.  I'm willing to buy it if it will CERTAINLY fix the problem once and for all.  I also don't see people posting resolutions when they review the problems.  That isn't a good sign either.\n\nTime will tell whether I end up happy, or end up in the return line before THIS return window expires.\n\nUpdate: 12/20/16\n\nSonos Customer Service says the diagnostics indicate this is a defective unit.  I guess I'll be standing in line later at Best Buy, because they offered ZERO resolution, nor can they adequately explain why it's defective.  This could explain why I see a plethora of open box units for sale.  The rest of their stuff is good, but the Playbar is not ready for prime time apparently.  I have owned TWO units and both were bad.  I might try a third for giggles and grins just to see if I'm betting I'll have no better luck from this brand.";(Updated:  confirmed defective)  Is the Playbar a lemon device?  Way too many others having problems with them.
15;75.0;3.0;5.0;Not worth the money. After installing several Sonos playbars in various configurations with surround speakers,  a huge flaw has become apparent. The Soundbar is not capable of processing surround inputs from a television which is its main signal feed. You must dumb down the signal to PCM or stereo instead of Dolby Surround or Dolby Plus. In short, this is not a good solution for a surround sound system, despite claims that it is.  For all other applications, they do just fine. It is a very rich sounding and sleek style.  If Sonos could fix the audio glitch issue from television audio then they would have a winner. There are many upset people as they have not come out with a solution for several years now and it is unlikely they will.;You must dumb down the signal to PCM or stereo instead of ...
99;76.0;1.0;11.0;"I purchased a Sonos Playbar from a 3rd party that was not an authorized seller.  This apparently voids the warranty unless the previous seller transfers it to you, which isn't possible in this case.  I find this type of business practice deplorable.\n\nSpecifically, I found it interesting that Sonos technical support will not even fix the Playbar for a fee.  They simply refuse to look at it.  What?\n\nFrom their website:  ""PROBLEMS OUTSIDE OF WARRANTY COVERAGE If we determine that the problem is not covered under the limited warranty, we will notify you and inform you of service or replacement alternatives that are available to you on a fee basis.""\n\nThe only alternative given to me was, ""sorry, we aren't going to fix it even for a fee.""\n\nI won't be buying Sonos again.  Wow.";Horrible Customer Service, Terrible Warranty & No Replacement Alternatives!
29;77.0;1.0;6.0;I've had the player and controller for about two and a half years.  I was satisfied until the forced software upgrade to version 6.4.\n\nI have the software installed on an iMac running the Snow Leopard operating system.  I use the iMac as my music server.  After the upgrade to 6.4, most functionality was lost.  Rather than allowing older machines to keep the functionality that they had prior to the upgrade, Sonos opted to disable it.  Sonos' logic is that they base their updates on Apple's update schedule.  In other words, if Apple no longer supports an OS, neither does Sonos.  The major flaw in that argument is that while the computers can't be updated, they keep functioning, but the Sonos software ceases to function.  It's an easy programmatic fix to keep the functionality for older machines in the updates but Sonos doesn't.  When I asked for an older version of their software, they replied that they don't archive their older software versions or have a software repository.  Unbelievable in this age of agile software development!\n\nIt became clear after looking for help in the Sonos user forum that many people are in a similar plight.  How about working on/releasing a fix?\n\nIt costs approximately $1000 for a bridge and playbar that are essentially useless at this point.  I feel like I've been robbed.;Beware of using Sonos products with older computers.

Specifically, that feature is Sonos' design and setup simplicity.\n\nSonos deserves a lot of high ratings for their simplicity of use and ease of setup. And with the latest release of their Sonos Controller app which includes universal search, Sonos hits high marks for many users - especially for those who use it exclusively to listen to music.\n\nHowever, the issue that can be found on this Amazon board, along with countless other boards online, is the back and forth dispute that Sonos does (or doesn't) provide a true Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound experience through the Playbar.\n\nI am here to tell you definitively that Sonos DOES provide a Dolby Digital 5.1 surround experience, but 9 times out of 10 you will not be able to get it using Sonos' simple setup of connecting your TV directly to your Playbar.\n\nMy home theater setup consists of the following components:\n\n -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LG-Electronics-50PN6500-50-Inch-1080p-600Hz-Plasma-HDTV-Black-2013-Model/dp/B00BBAFUQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LG Electronics 50PN6500 50-Inch 1080p 600Hz Plasma HDTV (Black) (2013 Model)</a>\n -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amazon-Fire-TV/dp/B00CX5P8FC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amazon Fire TV</a>\n - Comcast Xfinity Cable TV Cable Box\n -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SONOS-PLAYBAR-TV-Soundbar-and-Wireless-Speaker-for-Streaming-Music/dp/B00AEMGGU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SONOS PLAYBAR TV Soundbar and Wireless Speaker for Streaming Music</a>\n -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SONOS-SUB-Wireless-Subwoofer-Gloss/dp/B00834SIO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SONOS SUB Wireless Subwoofer (Gloss)</a>,\n -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SONOS-PLAY-1-Compact-Wireless-Speaker-for-Streaming-Music-Black/dp/B00EWCUK1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SONOS PLAY:1 Compact Wireless Speaker for Streaming Music - (Black)</a>&nbsp;(2X)\n -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AmazonBasics-Digital-Optical-Audio-Toslink-Cable-6-Feet/dp/B001TH7GSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AmazonBasics Digital Optical Audio Toslink Cable, 6 Feet</a>&nbsp;(2X)\n\nMany TVs, including newer models, have only one optical audio output slot to connect to the Sonos Playbar by way of a TOSlink cable. And not all TV have the internal hardware that decodes the audio out of that slot to Dolby Digital 5.1. Many, will decode to Stereo, PCM, or another 2 channel architecture like Dolby Pro Logic. However, the Sonos Playbar will take these 2 channel inputs from the TV's optical out slot and convert them to a stereo signal correctly partitioned into a left and right channel and mix the center channel, left surround, right surround, and low frequency effects (LFE) channel into a decent, albeit not distinct, surround sound experience.\n\nThe Sonos Playbar has a design flaw that could be easily corrected with one (of many possible) fixes. If the Playbar allowed for multiple optical audio inputs instead of one, a user could easily connect their streaming media player, Blueray player, and cable box. The software could be updated to see where an active audio signal is coming from and would switch to the appropriate source automatically or manually if necessary.\n\nWhen connected directly to my TV, the Sonos Controller registers ""Audio Input: Stereo"" for the Playbar under ""Settings"" -> ""About My Sonos System"". This means that the signal coming in from the TV is not decoding the Amazon Fire TV signal properly as Dolby Digital 5.1. However, when I connect the Amazon Fire TV directly to the Playbar, bypassing Sonos' instructions of connecting all of the components to the TV, the Sonos Controller registers ""Audio Input: Dolby Digital 5.1"" and the quality of the sound coming through all of the speakers is night and day. Playing the opening battle scene of Saving Private Ryan was much clearer and without a doubt pushed through 6 independent audio channels. Even the LFE channel pushing through the Sonos Sub was amazing.\n\nI have doubled down on the Sonos ecosystem and fully believe that the products and service warrant the price paid. And the small inconvenience of manually switching the audio cable in to the Playbar input is a small price to pay to have one of the best, truly wireless, home theater setups in the business.\n\nSo, for those of you reading all of the reviews and wondering if you need a really expensive TV to get true Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound with the Sonos home theater setup, the answer is no. You can get true Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound from Sonos with a small, albeit inconvenient, workaround. If you are willing to manually switch out the TOSlink cables from the single optical input slot on the rear of the Playbar, you will be thoroughly happy with this purchase.\n\nThe current retail value of building a Sonos home theater system will run you between $1,796 if using Play 1s as surround speakers to $1,996 if using Play 3s as surround speakers. I am using Play 1s as my surround speakers in a room that is approximately 320 square feet with 9 foot ceilings and they sound great. Given that they will be used for the surround channels, I believe you may only need Play 1s and not the upgraded Play 3s for a home theater configuration.\n\nI am sold on Sonos and fully recommend the Sonos Playbar to anyone who wants a powerful addition to their home theater setup. But, be prepared to fork down $699 for the SONOS SUB as it is an essential complementary component to the home theater setup.";With a Simple Workaround, It DOES Deliver Dolby Digital 5.1
30;79.0;5.0;6.0;I like most love watching movies. I have wasted so much money through the years trying to purchase sound bars / systems. I can tell you that the Sonos experience is second to none. Wish I would have invested sooner in this top shelf product. Due to the cost I purchased the soundbar first. I loved the sound and ease of set up. The next day I purchased the soundbar bracket. It made the sound even better by having the sound pointed right at you. After a few days I decided to go all in and purchase the sub and the small speakers giving my movie room true surround sound. Since you are going to be $2000 invested at this point I suggest getting the speaker stands. They are very sturdy and the height of them places the speakers right at couch level. I'm telling you, the movie experience is incredible.;Expensive but at the same time a bargain
55;80.0;5.0;8.0;I wrote a review for the new HEOS sound bar and realized that I had not yet written one for the Sonos. I thought the HEOS review explained enough of both to be included here.\n\nThis review will be in the form of a Head to Head comparison of the HEOS Soundbar and Sub vs. the Sonos Playbar and optional Sub as Denon is entering the growing Wireless Speaker Category that Sonos has led the evolution in for the past several years. Clearly the entire product range is matching the Sonos lineup. Play:1 - HEOS 1, Play:3 - HEOS 3, Play:5 - HEOS 5, Connect - HEOS Link, Playbar - HEOS Soundbar. Denon is also taking it up a notch by adding a few more products like the HEOS 7 and HEOS 1 GO Pack that are not in the Sonos lineup. I have been using Denon since my time in the professional music industry in the early 2000's where we sold a lot of Denon Pro Audio Equipment to Recording Studios. I have been using and installing a lot of Sonos gear for over 3 years now during remodeling of a lot of my clients homes. Here's my take from a Professional point of view....\n\n Sound Quality:\nDenon equipment sounds great. They have a long pedigree and know this area well. They have made their name based on this. You can tell right out of the box that this soundbar and sub combo have been matched and tuned to work together seamlessly. The factory settings are very good. You will probably keep the EQ settings for Treble and Bass center line. You may want to change the sub's level depending on how much Bass you prefer and where you place the sub. Every surface plane that you place the sub against will increase its perceived volume level. Floor = 1, Against a Wall = 2, In a Corner = 3. So placing your sub in a corner will make your bass sound the strongest. I was surprised by how well the system sounds compared to the Sonos because the weight of the soundbar and sub are lighter and smaller than the Sonos Playbar and Sub.\n Sonos gear sounds great also. They splashed onto the scene with great sound meets easy tech interface and app all wireless done. They also paired up amps and speakers 1:1 so everything is crisp and clean sounding and runs as efficiently as possible. Sonos speakers have a deep and rich sound with plenty of presence. The Playbar sounds wonderful and full range on its own. If you add the Sub then it really shines with a large sonic range. I usually adjust the EQ a little out of the box dialing the Treble and Bass up or down a notch as well as the Sub level if one is going to be in the room. The Sub is a separate purchase and doubles the price of the system compared to the HEOS. I often install Playbars without the sub in bedrooms for example or condo and townhouse units where neighbors are close. I do install Subs in main entertainment rooms that are medium to large in size and especially if a 5.1 system is desired.\nDuring initial setup of the system the HEOS app doesnt ask for any level settings and goes straight to factory defaults. The Sonos has a 2 part calibration section that first asks you if A or B is louder, then a second that asks you if the sub level needs to go up or down. The first part I believe is setting the phase of the sub, the second is setting the level. It plays a really cool sounding repeating test pattern as you perform these steps, and my clients are always impressed by this and often walk into the room to see what that sound is. Overall the Sonos system has great Sound Pressure Levels and packs a greater punch. The Denon is like a 250 HP sports car and the Sonos a 400 HP production muscle car. I will leave the Exotic cars reference to the Audiophile gear that is in a league of its own.\n\nSpeaker Design:\nThe HEOS soundbar and sub are lighter in weight and smaller than the Sonos. Of course price must be considered. To be fair the HEOS is $799 and the Sonos are $699 each ($1398 for playbar and sub). That is a huge difference and I believe Denon feels they can attract a larger market segment by offering a different pricing strategy on these components. The rest of the HEOS lineup matches the Sonos lineup in price. (HEOS 1 $199 - Play:1 $199, etc) I am not sure if making the HEOS Soundbar and Sub a lesser priced component was the best idea as it quality wise puts it at a disadvantage, but in affordability it makes it reachable to a larger purchasing base. They must be hoping that they can pull it off with good enough sound quality. Which they may have. However when handling the Soundbar and Sub and Handling the Playbar and Sub, you can tell immediately the difference in design quality that the extra money goes into. The Sonos Sub is a work of art. The Denon Sub is nicely designed but I wouldnt want to display it. The HEOS has many more connectors in the back. Power, Ethernet, Optical, Coax are the same, but it also has 1/8 mini jack, HDMI ARC in and out, USB and an IR emitter as well. The instruction booklet is minimal and doesnt fully explain the functions of everything. Perhaps Denon is planning on being able to control TVs via the IR Emitter thru the App, but currently their is no reference to its function. The USB can be used to play preloaded sound files and maybe more?, the line in jack allows hookup of a device, but being on the back of a soundbar is not an ideal location, but it is there none the less. All of their speakers have the line in which is great. Only the Play:5 has one. This allows you to say for example hook your laptop to the system and let it play Youtube video music thru out your new wireless home audio system. Great usable feature. The HDMI inputs are a big deal to me. The Sonos limits you to Optical cable to hookup to TV. Not all TVs will transfer HDMI 5.1 coding to Optical coding, so some of your connected to TV via HDMI devices will not be in 5.1 surround when it reaches the Sonos Playbar. This is not true for all TVs but for the majority it is. The Indicator light on the front of the Soundbar is a bit old school, too big and not that cool really. You can dim it to off for the bedroom or dim it almost to off, which I have done. It changes colors to indicate situations and Blue is the working normal color that it will be most of the time.\n\nInstallation:\nSonos sells an optional wall mount ($49, and they may want to start including it free with the playbar). It is very well made, has a built-in level vial, and makes wall mounting the Playbar a breeze. It leaves room for cables to run behind the Playbar. The HEOS Soundbar has two large keyhole slots on the back and includes a cardboard template to help you place the screws. (level and screws not included). Running the app to setup the Soundbar and Playbar is required. The Sonos creates a temporary wireless network that you join during the setup process, the HEOS requires you to hookup an included 1/8 mini cable between your device and the AUX 1/8 mini input on the back of the Soundbar. (take the soudbar off the wall 1st time). The Sonos enters setup mode as soon as you join its wifi network. The HEOS requires you to press the Connect button on the back when the front panel light turns a certain color (take if off wall 2nd time, try to look at front light while pressing back button with power, HDMI and ethernet cords dangling). After setup is complete your device will drop the Sonos wifi and return to your homes wifi and now the Sonos will be on your homes wifi too and/or also using the hardwire ethernet connection too (recommended). After setup is complete your HEOS will be on your homes wifi and now you can unplug the mini cable (take off wall 3rd time). Sonos installation went so much more smoothly.\n\nApp Control:\nThe Sonos app has been out longer and is so much more intuitive, pretty, and functional. The HEOS app is clunky, unrefined and still under development by comparison. Im sure it will become more more than it is over time and probably resemble the Sonos app in many ways. The ease of use and delight is really a big part of the Sonos equation. I know that I can leave an installation and know that the new owners can learn and run the system fine without me. That is a huge part of the benefit for me. The HEOS app is still in its infancy and I would be much more reluctant to recommend and demo it.\n\nOverall Impressions:\n\nThis is a review I wrote for the Denon HEOS Soundbar and Sub and I have posted it here under the Sonos Playbar because I realized that I have not yet written a review for it and this review has a lot of pertinent information.\n\n This review will be in the form of a Head to Head comparison of the HEOS Soundbar and Sub vs. the Sonos Playbar and optional Sub as Denon is entering the growing Wireless Speaker Category that Sonos has led the evolution in for the past several years.

During first time setup both the HEOS and Sonos will likely need to update their internal firmware. The Sonos update takes about 2 minutes and the HEOS took almost 15! Just keep that in mind if you need to install within a certain amount of time.\n\nApp Control:\nThe Sonos app has been out longer and is so much more intuitive, pretty, and functional.

I like that. I like the new components they are adding like the HEOS 1 Mobile Pack which turns a HEOS 1 speaker into a battery powered and bluetooth capable speaker. I have always been frustrated with Sonos for not having Bluetooth capability. I bought a separate bluetooth speaker to take to work with me on jobs to listen to music with streaming from my smartphone. I always thought that I should just be able to take my Play:1 with me. But it requires wifi. I had to purchase a different companies product that their own could have served. Maybe Sonos will counter with their own Play:1 Go Pack. That would be great. I like that all the HEOS speakers have a Line In Input, Sonos makes you get the Play:5 to have that feature. The features and expandability of the HEOS line is large. It does add some complexity to the system which may cause the user interface and ease of the system to be negatively affected, maybe so or maybe not, but that will depend on the evolution of the HEOS app and how well they can integrate everything. I really have to say that the Sonos reminds me of Apple products which take complex amazing hardware functional designs and put them under the hood of a simple, intuitive and beautiful design interface. The HEOS reminds me of Windows and Android which breaks free of Proprietary and Control Limitations to allow more user customized experience. Both are great approaches and needed in my opinion. I look forward to the continued refinements in the HEOS world. I hope this review via comparison has left you with enough information to make an informed decision and not too much so that you cant. Anyway you choose you are committing to one platform or another. So take your time. Who knows maybe cross platform technology will emerge that will allow you mix the systems and control via one App! Now that would be really great!;SONOS vs HEOS. Battle Royal.
31;81.0;3.0;6.0;I purchased a Playbar, sub, and 2 surround speakers in January 2014.  I like the system and it sounds great.  Now in Sep 2016 the playbar went dead and I couldn't bring it back up on the controller.  I tried factory resetting several times to no avail.  I finally had to give in and call tech support.  I explained the problem and sent them the diagnostics report.  In the end they said the unit had frozen and would need to be replaced.  They also said they have a one year warranty but since I was the original owner the would replace it for $190 and would not come down off that.  Quite a bit of money to spend for something that only lasted 2 and half years.  I went ahead and paid for the replacement because it is a great system when it's working.  I just hope the replacement lasts a lot longer.;Frozen Playbar After a Couple Years
69;82.0;3.0;9.0;"I'm a huge Sonos fan and have 3 Play 1s and a Play 3 scattered around the house. We absolutely love them.  It made sense then to buy the Playbar to integrate with our current system.  However, after buying it and trying it out I had to return it for several reasons.\n\n1.  The main problem with the playbar is that Sonos wants you to plug it into the back of the TV but unfortunately most TVs (mine included) do not pass Dolby 5.1 audio so you really are not getting true surround sound. This may not seem like much of an issue but once you hear 5.1 surround sound, you can tell there's a huge difference.  When you're spending this much money for a great set of speakers you want it to work correctly and unfortunately the way that Sonos is set up it just won't work that way.  It is possible to hook up the Playbar directly to the source (blu-Ray player, Apple tv, etc) and get 5.1 sound, however, this requires multiple wires and a switch since the Playbar only has one input.  With Sonos you are paying for ease of use and simplicity and so if you have to ""rig up"" a system to combat its shortcomings, then it's just not worth it.  I did connect the play 1s as surrounds and it sounds great when connected directly to the source, however, this leads me to my next issue:\n\n2. Lack of DTS support. If you want to get 5.1 surround sound you have to connect the sound bar directly to the source. However Sonos doesn't support DTS which is the audio on pretty much every Blu-Ray. Meaning you cannot get 5.1 surround sound from your Blu-ray player. Also even if it did support DTS my Blu-ray player does not have an optical out output and so it wouldn't work for that reason as well.\n\nIn summary, if you're paying this much money for a great set of speakers and 5.1 surround sound, then it better damn well output 5.1 surround sound.  My guess is that people just don't know the difference and don't know what they are missing out on.  I absolutely love Sonos for multiple room audio and have always raved about it to friends but I have to say I am really disappointed in the Playbar.";Long time Sonos fan disappointed with the Playbar
21;83.0;1.0;5.0;My friend paid way too much money for the soundbar to have it be as complicated as it is to set up. The sound bar came with a optical cable that plugs directly into the Soundbar and into the TV, so by that logic you think hooking it into your TV to use as your TV speakers would be easy. Well I'm sorry to say you would be wrong with that kind of thinking. Even with the optical cable hooked into the TV and Soundbar you still need to have the Sound Bar connected to your WiFi in order to get it to work. Now if you are like me and you have a crappy router and in order to get internet throughout your entire house you have to have a jumper or a WiFi extender well then you might as well pay $100 get the Sonos boost so on top of a $700 overly complicated speaker now you have to pay another hundred dollars just to get the speaker to work on your TV even though there's an optical cable that's completely useless and should make this hole setup about 5 minutes long. I would not mind all this extra hassel if I would have paid $300 or $400 or even $600 for a soundbar but unfortunately I convinced my friend to go with this brand because of its high ratings and renown and now I severely regret it. A waste of time and a bigger waste of money. I do not recommend this item!;$700 DOES NOT MEAN AN EASY SETUP!
64;84.0;1.0;8.0;The SONOS Android app searches endlessly for the SONOS Playbar and never finds it. Maybe my unit is defective or SONOS have abandoned the app, but this coupled with the fact that SONOS sell a $700 unit WITH NO REMOTE is unacceptable. Here on Amazon I can buy a true 5.1 wireless surround system from Vizio for $200 that comes with a playbar, a remote, a sub-woofer and two rear satellite speakers outputting 100 db of sound.\n\nYou've been warned.;Where's the remote?
27;85.0;1.0;5.0;We initially loved the Playbar and, if I were writing this review within six months of my purchase, it would have been 5 stars.  We have a bunch of Sonos speakers, and really enjoyed the sound and (for us) the ease of operation.  However, our first Playbar failed in less than a year.  Just dead--does not appear to power on, is not discoverable, etc.  We called.  We argued.  They sent us a refurbished one at no charge.  So, fine.  Not so convenient, but everyone's entitled to a slip up, right?  Well, it, too, failed in a few months. We called again, only to be told they won't replace it the second time. Instead, they want $175.00 from us to send us another refurbished one, as well as taking back our broken one so they can refurbish it and sell it again. We won't be sending them any more of our money.;Great in the beginning, dies in a matter of months
37;86.0;2.0;6.0;"I purchased one of these with the sub woofer 2 years ago.  It's basically a mid to low end consumer product.  Much like Bose they are mixed and set for the mid range.  Thus the saying ""no highs, no lows, must be Bose""  This is the same.  It's horrible for movie watching.  It doesn't and cant' simulate surround at all.  You'd need another 4 speakers.  Don't even bother using it for music.  But it's not engineered or marketed that way.\n\nMy ears are pretty good and this is my business so I know what I'm talking about.  The dialogue tends to get washed and tinny.  It completely lacks lows and even the sub doesn't help that much unless there's an explosion in a scene and the extreme lows might shake your couch.\n\nYou can tell it's a consumer grade product geared towards a teenagers or kids room with a tv because it completely lacks any kind of I/O.  THere are NO inputs or outputs at all save for ethernet and an optical.  What?!! Why?  Because when you buy a sonos you are absolutely locked into ONLY their products.\n\nAgain, extremely mediocre to poor dialogue, no highs or lows and overpriced.  Go take a look at a real center speaker like the Yamaha's.  The YSP-5600 and similar lines.  The 5600 actually has Atmos surround, multiple I/O like 4 HDMI ins that will pass through 4K UHD and multiple outs.  Plus 46 quality speakers with Atmos and DTS:X mixing.  Or look at the Paradigm center speaker.  That's a really nice one as well.\n\nSonos is a toy.  It's a completely limited and closed system.

113;87.0;5.0;10.0;"Update: Jan 2015:  The Playbar remains the most useful and used device in our house.  It has added tremendous value to our SONOS system. We've had Deezer for a couple of month now and love it.  ""...the web-based music streaming service and SONOS announced ""Deezer Elite, a new exclusive service made for and in partnership with Sonos. Deezer Elite provides High-Resolution Audio (HRA) to US users of Sonos HI-FI Systems"".  Yes (HRA).  This is a game changer in the industry that brings tremendous value to the SONOS system.\n\nInitial review:\nThis PLAYBAR fills our 34'L by 20'W by 10'H open Living/Kitchen area with massive impressive audio; a stunning transformation when compared to our previous soundbar. It's quality built, easy to setup and use and provides the added benefit of integration with the rest of our SONOS home audio system.  The PLAYABR has become one of the most functional gadgets in the house.  If you're new to SONOS, and your TV is located in an area where you spend a good deal of your time, consider making the SONOS PLAYBAR your first SONOS component.\n\n>>>>> LISTENING MODES:\n1. Turn your TV ON and the PLAYBAR streams your TV audio automatically. You control volume either with the TV remote you normally use or with any SONOS Controller. It can even be controlled with the IPad's volume button\n2. When your TV is OFF you use your SONOS Controller to stream your Music Source to the PLAYBAR -- Thousands of stations worldwide are provided for free with the SONOS app, including free, no ads, access to Pandora radio.\n3. Stream TV audio to another ROOM(s) equipped with a SONOS Player - You can group (add) the PLAYBAR's TV audio to other ROOMS on the SONOS Controller.\n4. Watch TV while streaming a different audio source; for example a sports game while streaming the play by play of your favorite sports radio announcer.  Volume can be adjusted either with the TV remote or the Sonos Controller.  If you stop playing the radio station the audio switches back to TV.\n\n>>>>> Our other SONOS COMPONENTS:\n--> CONNECT: streams SONOS audio to an old Pioneer receiver/amplifier which powers an old set of JBL speakers in media room.\n--> CONNECT AMP: streams and amplifies music to a couple of built-in speakers.\n--> 2 PLAY3 speakers: I got them paired, R and L speakers, in a bedroom.  I set the ""Sleep Timer"" and fall asleep every night listening to the the Mozart Radio. A PLAY3 by itself delivers impressive audio. But when you pair a pair of PLAY3's the sound quality improves by tenfolds, especially if you sit in the sweet spot to enjoy the real stereophonic audio.  PLAY3 or PLAY5, which one should you get? I tried them both and they are both excellent, but because of the different acoustics design, ROOM SIZE DOES INDEED MATTER; if left at default levels, a PLAY5 in a small room may sound overwhelming even at low volume, and a PLAY3 in a big size room may sound weak.  The PLAY3 can stand either vertically or horizontally but has no Line In input, the PLAY5 stands only horizontally and has a Line In input which you can use to stream music from a separate music player or computer.\n--> SUB: You can pair it with any Player.  We paired it with the PLAYBAR.  It's a perfect match and a good way to get the most use out of the SUB.  The SUB's ON and OFF, and a slider level adjustment (- and +) can be controlled independently in the app.\n--> BRIDGE: You connect it to your home network router.  It's a special wireless SONOS router dedicated to serving SONOS Players (apparently a Bridge can stream audio to 100+ different SONOS Players)\n\n>>>>> ABOUT THE SONOS APP (many updates since this initial review but basics remain the same):\nA powerful, yet easy and intuitive app works flawlessly. You can install the free SONOS Controller app on a PC, Mac, Smartphone, iPod, iPad, Tablet, etc... --  You select your ""ROOM(s)"" and ""Music Source"" for playing your audio.  You assign a ""ROOM Name"" to each SONOS Player. We assigned the name ""Living Room & TV"" to the PLAYBAR.  ""Music Source"" is your music library, your playlists, a multitude of radio options, your Lined In music player or other sources to chose from.  From any SONOS Controller in your house, you can select different Music Sources and play them in different ROOMS at the same time, or, you can group ROOMS to play in perfect sync the same ""Music Source"".  After you setup your PLAYBAR you will notice that ""TV"" is available as a ""Music Source"" to the ROOM assigned to the PLAYBAR, or to the group of ROOMS grouped with the PLAYBAR.  For the individual SONOS components, you can adjust bass, treble and balance, - create a stereo pair of Play3's (or Play5's), - turn On or Off the individual white lights on the SONOS components. The fine volume adjustment (sliders in the app) for the individual Players is accessible from any SONOS Controller and works smoothly.  The IPad's volume button works as well.  I often use the ""Sleep Timer"" and ""Alarm"" feature. The SONOS app/software is an integral part of the SONOS system functionality.  The app notifies you periodically of an available update (software update for your app, or, Firmware update for your component(s)). Updates usually include enhancements and new features.\n\n>>>>> SONOS System and ""Music Source"" access:\nA SONOS System encompasses:-\n1) the SONOS Player(s) and Bridge(s) you purchase from SONOS,\n2) your home network devices, (i.e. your PC(s), laptop(s), and handheld(s)), on which you installed the free SONOS app(s), and\n3) your router connected to your devices and with access to the web.\nOur Music Library, which is an iTunes music collection, resides on an old PC we leave ON and running 24/7.\n>> While Radio Music Sources are accessed directly via router, the Music Library is accessed as long as the device designated in the app as the source for your ""Music Library"" is ON and running.  The app creates an index for each song in your Music Library (i.e. DeviceName/FileLocation/FileName).  Use the command ""Update Music Library Now"" after you add to or delete music from your Library.\n>> The SONOS app can also access the local music on the device you are using as the SONOS controller; for example, on an iPad, in addition to ""Music Library"", you will also find ""This iPad"", as a Music Source.  So, your kid(s) can plays own music on own handheld in a room, while you listen to your Music Library or any other Music Source in a different room.  Confirm with SONOS that their app runs on your devices's OS.\n\n>>>>> REMOTE SIMPLICITY:\nThe PLAYBAR does not come with a remote.  This is how I paired our Comcast/Xfinity set-top box remote, already pre-programed to work with our TV:- I pointed the remote towards the PLAYBAR and pressed the volume key on the remote as instructed by the app's installation process.  That's it!  Once paired, I can use either the remote or the SONOS Controller to adjust volume regardless of Music Source (TV or other).\n\n>>>>> ITUNES Radio - 9/20/2013 update\n A SONOS Playbar and Apple TV provide a convenient way to play the New Itunes Radio on SONOS because both devices remain connected through your TV.  You select the radio station with the Apple TV remote, and with the SONOS controller app, you can ""group"" the Playbar's audio with other SONOS players in your house and/or adjust volume.\nAn Apple device could also be connected to the Line In input of a SONOS component (a Connect:Amp or a Play 5) and access ITunes Radio.\n\n***** FIVE STARS FOR SONOS *****\nI purchased my first SONOS Player (the Connect:Amp) in December 2011 and the PLAYBAR in March 2013. Never had any issues or problems.  I highly recommend SONOS.";Thumbs Up to SONOS' PLAYBAR
56;88.0;3.0;7.0;A really good concept with only one major hole in it.  As others have mentioned, there's only an optical in and not an hdmi in.  Sonos expects you to use the TV as your central switching device.  I bought it because I wanted to stream music and I liked that the system as a whole is configurable.  Would have been a no-brainer if they had included hdmi inputs and one output to the tv.  I then could have used it to totally replace my A/V receiver.;A really good concept with only one major hole in it
88;89.0;5.0;9.0;"While not a regular reviewer on Amazon, I'd like to take issue with the reviewer who claims that The Sonos Playbar ruins 5.1 sound.\n\nAs a growing Sonos fan-owner of several Play 5's, docks, bridges, Subwoofers and most recently a Playbar and 2 Play 1's, I applaud Sonos for constantly improving their line of hardware and software resulting in affordable and easy to use products that can vastly expand the musical horizons of those who own them. Not a month after I purchased my Playbar (a standout stand alone home theater enhancer, I was advised by Sonos that I could wirelessly add 2 Play 1 speakers which perfectly integrate with my Playbar and subwoofer to create a true 5.1 sound reproduction.\n\nTwo weeks after adding the Play 1's as rear speakers and choosing the Sonos home theater setup on my Sonos menu, I find that I greatly enjoy a home theater system which compares favorably with others costing far more. In short--if The Playbar leaves you wanting a ""little bit more"" surround sound-wise, add a pair of Play 1's which will add great depth and versatility to your home theater system. Well done, Sonos!";A rebuttal to The most helpful? Critical review.

100;91.0;1.0;9.0;I was in the market for a new surround system but did not want a large set up, which is why I wanted a sound bar. I did a lot of research and discovered the Sonos Playbar and was intrigued by the idea of being able to stream internet radio, connect different devices, etc. which is the whole idea behind Sonos. I liked the simplistic design and the iPad app looked like it would be fun to use. Of course I was excited when everything arrived, including the Bridge which connects to your router so you can stream to other wireless devices in the house. So I followed the instructions, hooked everything up, downloaded the iPad app--and nothing. It seems my Playbar is not recognized by the iPad (or PC) Controller. Great. So then I decided to call the customer service number, but they closed at 5 pm PST. Then I spent the next two hours looking for a solution online in the Sonos forums. It appears as though connection issues are a VERY COMMON problem, so if you are considering buying a Sonos product I recommend browsing them to get a sense regarding the amount of issues people face, even after everything is set up properly. So now it is after 9 pm and I've tried everything that Sonos recommends for my issue, and still nothing. I'll call them tomorrow and update my review as necessary, but I'm really disappointed. Sonos touts their products for their simplicity and ease of use, but I've just wasted my entire night with this hunk of garbage which has been ANYTHING BUT simple and easy to use. I'm two seconds away from returning it.;Horrible Experience So Far
102;92.0;1.0;9.0;There is absolutely no difference in the sound quality of the television without the soundbar versus with. What an expensive boo boo. If I had the original box, I would return it. PLUS, nowhere does it say in the Amazon notes that one must buy an additional connector for $50 AND have a Smart phone for hook-up. Possibly using the Pandora, or streaming ITunes would make it worthwhile. I can't say in regard to that. But if I could dig through the garbage to find that dumb box, I'd hope to dig up the original EXPENSIVE cost with it. Stick to speakers in the ceiling.;Why oh why oh why oh why.
32;93.0;2.0;5.0;"I am new to Sonos but when I was looking to buy a 4K tv, I saw this soundbar. I knew Sonos's reputation for high audio fidelity and loved the geeky, sound anywhere idea for my house. I purchased it along with the Subwoofer and the top of the line Sony XBR75X940D. The sound is great (and yes, get the Sub if you are getting this, totally worth it.) However beware of two things:\n\n1. If this is your first Sonos device (as it was mine) it must be physically connected via a cord to your ethernet connection or else the subwoofer won't work.\n\n2. This soundbar does not support DTS sound.\n\nI ""solved"" #1 by buying the Sonos Boost and connected that to an ethernet connection. Now the sound with subwoofer sounds great!\n\nThere is no workaround for #2.

The only workaround is to use the DVD disc at the expense of your image resolution. Needless to say, I'm disappointed in this product. When it works it's awesome, but it doesn't work with the latest blu-ray discs. Save yourself some heartache and look for another soundbar for your new TV. If you really want a Sonos connected theatre system, the recommendation is to buy a real AV system and use it with the Sonos Connect.";Does not support DTS sound. Disappointed? Me too.
49;94.0;1.0;6.0;I own several Sonos products and find (for the most part) the performance of the speakers and the iOS app. to be very good. I recently purchased the Playbar to pair with the Sub and 2 Play 3's as an upgrade to my home theater. The system has it's merits, convenience is one. The audio dropout problem when using a device that outputs Dolby 5.1 is a known issue and has been well documented (see Sonos support forum). Sonos own lame repsonse is a strong indication that the product fails to pass muster. Product is not good as a substitute for good receiver and regular speakers. Buyer beware. No star rating is indicative of Sonos lame response to complaints and lack of Support for DTS.;Be aware of audio dropout issues when using Dolby 5.1
51;95.0;5.0;6.0;"This is a great soundbar if you want to use the Sonos ecosystem. I love the connectivity and ease-of-use of Sonos. I have two Play 1s in different rooms and the Playbar + Subwoofer in the living room. There may be better soundbars out there, but this one sounds better than my previous 5.1 surround system (12"" Sub, a decent receiver, and high-end speakers).\n\nThe Playbar fills my large living room with powerful sound. I had it for a couple of days before my subwoofer arrived. While the Playbar will put out good sound on it's own, it definitely needs the Sub to compete with a good 5.1 surround system.

116;97.0;5.0;9.0;"Solution for single optical input\nI did my research prior to ordering the playbar and found an answer to how do I get 5.1 from all my inputs.  I have 3 different audio sources: Game Console, Cable Box, and DLNA from TV.  They make optical selector switches.  They may make automatic ones, but I found this manual one on Amazon.  It allows me to output optical feeds from my 3 devices into the switch and then select the output to the playbar.  The design is straightforward and works well.  Change inputs, turn switch.  You may need to acquire a few extra optical cables, but then you should be good to go.  5.1 sound to your Play 3's and SUB from multiple inputs.\n\nResults:\nTV output sounds great, so happy to put my SONOS investment to use with TV.\n\nLink to product on Amazon\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/C2G-Cables-to-Go-28734-Digital-Audio-Explorer-Toslink-Selector-Switch/dp/B0002OF2FC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">C2G / Cables to Go 28734 Digital Audio Explorer Toslink Selector Switch</a>";Single Optical Input Fix
123;98.0;5.0;9.0;Important:  Check first if your TV has an optical digital audio out or you will not be able to connect this playbar directly to your TV.\n\nIf you do not have an optical digital audio out on your TV, but you have a receiver check if that receiver has an optical digital audio out and then connect the playbar there (assuming you have your cable or dish provider connected to the receiver).\n\nYou could also connect it to an optical digital audio out of a DVD or BluRay or game system but then the sound will be limited to just that device.\n\nYou will also need to connect the Sonos directly to your router to set it up for the first time (like any other sonos product). If you do have the sonos bridge or any other sonos product connected to your router you could do it wireless.\n\nThe setup process was very easy and I used the Sonos app for the iPhone. The setup will guide you step by step and in less than a minute you should be ready to go.  The last part of the setup consist on pointing to the playbar the regular TV remote control so you can control the volume with your regular TV remote control.\n\nThe audio is fantastic.

I have only tested for a few hours but I am really happy.\n\nI would recommend this product to anybody.;Great product
59;99.0;4.0;6.0;"I'm an absolute Sonos fanatic owning 9 pieces, in all.  I run the Playbar + Sub + Play:1 surrounds in my media room.  I've owned the Playbar since a couple weeks after it launched but am just now writing a review.  I want to think it is the best performing speaker in the history of mankind, but quite simply, its not.  The bass is very light (can't expect too much from any soundbar) and it is not especially clear nor does it 'fill the room' with sound.  It sounds substantially better than TV speakers but still sounds flat.\n\nOn the positive side, it rounds out an existing Sonos ecosystem very nicely and the implementation is very clean.  I can control the volume with my app and listen to music with all the speakers with the use of my Macbook and/or phone app - just like any other Sonos component.  By itself, the Play:5 outperforms it when playing pure music as it has punchier bass and seemingly wider dynamic range.\n\nIn summary, I'd recommend the Playbar if you're rounding out your Sonos setup, but there are likely better options you should consider if that's not the case.  Spending close to $1800 for my system's quality would probably something I'd think about a bit more before I dove in, but I built the system slowly after I built upon the Playbar.\n\nOn a complete side note, the Sub is the best Sonos component, by far - but also the biggest luxury.  The Play:5's are probably second best due to their sound quality.  The other components in their line all somewhere under those.  The Playbar is probably the least ""bang for your buck"" since there are cheaper/superior alternatives to be had for the same price, but again, if you're a Sonos-nut I wouldn't recommend against it.\n\nAlthough this isn't a glowing review, its basically the truth - you basically have to weigh how much you value the wireless-ness (of the Sub and surrounds) and the Sonos ecosystem - if you don't then its no-brainer to not get this system.  However, if you're all-in to Sonos the system performs adequately, just don't prepare to have your socks blown off.";Get it for the ecosystem, not the speaker.
106;100.0;2.0;8.0;I have my playbar joined with a sub and two play 3's to make a 5.1 system. It is connected to a Panasonic plasma tv TC-P60GT50. The GT50 does NOT pass through to the optical out DD 5.1 when watching content from HDMI connected source. It WILL pass DD 5.1 out when watching content from Netflix or Amazon apps on the TV. I solved this problem by buying an optical switch and using it to switch the outputs from my various sources (Apple TV, Sony Blu-Ray, Direct TV box) to the playbar. This allows the DD 5.1 to go from my devices to the playbar and works really well in my opinion. I also use the setup as my alarm clock, my music device etc etc. I really like the Sonos system, I use the spotify and the radio apps most of the time. I use my ipad, kindle fire, and iphone as the controller and to me all work equally well.\nThe one main problem I have with this is that it does not decode Dolby Digital + or DTS. Though these suggestions are under consideration over on the Sonos support website.\n2 Aug 13\njust a little updating here...\nThe problem with DTS is getting to be more of a problem for me. Several streaming sites are adding DTS to their movie content, so those + blu rays I cannot play in the bedroom where I have the play bar.\nI have read that PS 3's can downgrade DTS to 5.1 but I myself have no knowledge of it, and don't want to buy a PS3 just for movies in the bedroom.\nBut now to the good news, I love the playbar for watching TV and listening to music. Some people have said it's not good for music, but to me I love it. To each his own I guess.\nI mostly airplay my music now from my macbook air ---> apple TV -----> optical switch ----> play bar. I also turn the game on in the bedroom, then group my zones together and have the game playing through the house.\n\n20 Jan 14 Update *****\nSonos has finally decided to NOT support DTS which is really disappointing to me. It's great hardware but the software side of the house is really being neglected due to choices by the sonos company. I have dropped my review and actually have to say I regret my purchase now. For the past year, sonos had DTS support under consideration, but recently changed that to not planned. Supposedly it's just a software update that will enable DTS but they are not going to undertake it. This is a problem because from most tv's they only output stereo 2.0 from the optical out when the source is fed from HDMI into the tv. And when this is the case the sonos system really sounds lousy. It really sounds good when you send Dolby 5.1 to the system or as I had hoped I could do, DTS. But as it is, my blu-rays are encoded in DTS and as such I can't watch them using the play bar, the only option is to use tv speakers while staring at a silent 700 dollar play bar.;Sounds great but software wise sonos is really dropping the ball

And then it requires internet access for a bunch of the features. This was all a major inconvenience and not something that is mentioned anywhere in the set up instructions. Jumped through all the hoops to get this set up and then discovered that the sound is extremely thin, ended up replacing this with a bose system.;Thin sound, requires wifi to even get set up.
61;102.0;5.0;6.0;Let me start by saying i have used many sound bars before settling with SONOS over a period of 5-6 years. I have used LG, Samsung, Sony ,Vizio and even BOSE. Among all i used VIZIO for long time and i was pretty happy with it. The main reason to move to sound bar is to avoid all wires and running them throughout the house. I used to have a AV system with 5 surround speakers but never happy with it . For subwoofer i used to have Butt Kicker which goes under the couch . I got rid of all and moved to sound bars for simplicity. Recently i wanted to have a premium sound bar so looked at BOSE Cinemate 150. its a good sound bar but the price was never justified. Within 3 days i returned the Bose. I was never getting surround sound.\n\nAfter Bose i tried SONOS playbar . The showcased SONOS in best buy never did justice to it. It looked and sounded junk  in best buy. I learned you can add more speakers later to make it surround and that to wireless. Though i used Vizio with same concept but the surround sound was not that effective. So finally i bought all three , playbar, subwoofer and 2 play-1 speakers. When i connected all i learned you need to have one of the component permanently connected to WiFi router. I cant as the WiFi is in a different floor. So to fill the gap ,i bought a used bridge for 12$. Now i have a complete system.\n\nTo test the sound i played few you tube videos with Dolby and 5.1 audio clips. It sounded awesome. I live in a town home and i cant use high volumes. Luckily my neighbor is an old lady and cant hear well. So she never complained until now . But i think she will some day due to SONOS. I found myself continuously turning off SUB to reduce the Boom Effect. I realized that the playbar and Play 1's are more then enough to produce good bass effects with out the SUB. I tested this for few days and convinced i should not waste money on SUB which just sits without being used. So any one who is concerned about bass and neighbors, i feel the playbar is more then enough and you won't miss the SUB.\n\nThe sound clarity is superb but i need to increase the volume to hear dialogs clearly. I used the dialog enhancer but not enough as i sit almost 12 feet away from TV.\n\nThis playbar cant play DTS but i don't care as long as i get surround sound . I watched the movie Deep blue See and i feelat one scene that the sound was traveling around me. Excellent Surround effect.\n\nI recommend this playbar for excellent sound when coupled with Play 1 speakers. May be you can skip SUB all together.;Wow, A terrific Soundbar for Surround Effect
124;103.0;5.0;8.0;For Starters, I never write reviews, but this sound bar combined with the SUB is the missing link I have been looking for.  I began using SONOS several years ago. Up until today, I had a SONOS connect hooked to a 5.1 receiver.  Changing settings and listening modes for movies and music was always challenging for family members.  I am not an audiophile but I know what sounds good. I tested a few movies and various genera's of music... no muss...no fuss.  Transitioning from TV/Movie watching to music is seamless.  The reduction in wires and no more fiddling with sound settings etc.. is just icing on the cake... I am so impressed I can go on and on about this outstanding sound bar.. My SONOS system is complete.;OUTSTANDING!!!
65;104.0;4.0;6.0;I love sonos products but this product isn't really for everyone.\n\nsound quality\nsound quality is great with an impressive sound separation for a system this small. make sure to always put in an open space so you can take advantage of the two side firing tweeters. center channel is a little underwhelmed which made dialogue hard to hear, but you can make it up by 1. turning up the volume or 2. using the speech enhancement feature. the soundbar sounds exponentially more room-filling when you pair it with a sub.\n\nsetup\nsetup was dead simple compared to many other sound systems. with the step by step instructions on the sonos app i doubt anyone would have issues setting the soundbar up by itself. and it works seamlessly with my directv remote so you don't have to use the sonos app most of the time.\n\nstreaming music\nother than the ability to play sound from your tv, it works just like any other sonos speakers. streaming music is very easy and the sound quality is great (if you pandora or spotify, make sure you subscribe to the premium service to get the full audio quality).\n\nnow the cons\n\nno DTS\nit's a really annoying because the soundbar doesn't support DTS, which is what most blu-ray sources have. all DTS sources will come out as stereo even if you force your blu-ray player to output dts. there are a few cheap samsung players that can transcode dts to dolby. and if you already invested in the expensive sonos system i'm sure you wouldn't mind paying 80 bucks for a new blu-ray player.\nbut i just gave up and ditched blu-ray all together and bought an apple TV (most movies on apple tv have dolby digital 5.1 so player can play without an issue). this didn't bug me as much as it should because my TV is mounted on the wall and there is no space for a blu-ray player anyway. luckily, with the soundbar's IR repeater feature i was able to hide the ATV out of sight while making sure the box gets the IR signal from its remote.\n\nno surround sound support on many TVs\nthis issue doesn't really bother me too much since my sharp aquous was able to output dolby but as i learned from other users, sound signal will be down mixed to stereo if the TV doesn't support bitstream. fortunately, there are quite a few new TVs in the market that can do bitstream already. but it's hard to know because the manufacturers do not list it on their product info. if your tv doesn't have bitstream support you need to use an hdmi switch with an optical port output. but it shouldn't be too much of an issue since most people have enough room for an extra box in their TV stands anyway.\n\nbottomline\nmake sure you learn all its limitations before buying the system. if you are willing to compromise with its limitations, playbar is a great choice for you and i am sure it'll impress you with its great sound quality.;nice system but not for everyone
47;105.0;4.0;5.0;First of all I have to say I love my SONOS system, its easy to configure, gives great sound and the best part is totally wireless. Since I hate having cables everywhere I always tend to hide them behind the wall or make special installations. This totally solved my life!\n\nThe configuration is pretty straight forward, and it works right away with my OLED LG TV. I used to have a full home theater BOSE system with an Onkyo receiver and I have to say I'm so impressed with this system that it covers all my needs.\n\nThe only flaw that I see and I'm sure it will depend on the Television is that when I sent passthrough for the 5.1 channel I got lip sync delay. On the bright side my TV supports lip sync unitl certain point so this totally fix the issue. Before buying I will definitely check that it supports 2 things:\n\n1.- Lip Syncing\n2.- Support for Digital Dolby Passthrough optical.\n\nCheck also this link before buying for hometheater to see if your tv is compatible ( https://sonos.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1931/related/1 ).\n\nI bought the SONOS Playbar with 2 PLAY:3 and a sub. Totally recommended if you like watching movies!;Read this review before buying!
48;106.0;5.0;5.0;First, let's address the elephant in the room: the price tag on this thing is a whopper! I'm still feeling super guilty about spending the money. Add to this, don't even think about getting the Bar without the Sub, which means doubling your cost. Pile on the guilt-factor! So, does that make it worth the price? I'm still not 100% convinced of that, but this thing (with the Sub) is simply fantastic.\n\nIf you are buying just the bar, it's fine. It has better sound alone than a bar/sub combo I bought (and returned) from Samsung. Audio is crystal clear and it gives the TV the much needed audio boost most flat screens need these days. Set up is super-easy. As soon as I installed the app, it picked up my wifi and started the set up. [A note here: if you are going to add any additional Sonos speakers to your system, at least one should be connected via ethernet. I have a bridge in my TV console, so this was easy for me. It isn't necessary to have the bar hard-wired, however, as you could add another speaker connected to ethernet later on.]\n\nThe Sonos app is the only way to set up the bar. Once the app is up and running, you play your music via the app. This is different, but works great. I don't like to have anything on the screen when listening to music (like you have to with TV music channels) so this is perfect and WAY better than bluetooth! Gone are the days of switching sources on my sound bar. I can access my iTunes library (Apple Music is in beta now) and Sirius from the app and instantly start playing either. When I'm ready to watch TV, it picks up the TV sound right away. So easy! Like many things should, this just works.\n\nWhere this bar really shines, though, is with the addition of the sub. Without it, the bass on the bar alone simply falls short. In this facet, I would say it is definitely NOT worth the price. But, if house shaking, chest-thumping, bass isn't what you want/need, the bar is certainly great by itself. Add the sub, however, and you get some of the best bass I've heard in a sound bar set-up. When the volume is down, it provides just enough bass boost to enhance any TV, music, or games. Crank up the volume, though, and hold on! This things thumps! Explosions are huge, music is better, and games are propelled to the next level.\n\nThe bar is supposed to simulate surround sound, but don't expect much. I've heard a little bit of 'movement' from left to right (or right to left) in the sound, but not much. My understanding is that this improves with the addition of more speakers. However, the slight 'movement' you do get, adds more depth then you would get from your TV alone, or other sound bars I've had/heard.\n\nSo, the bottom line is this: It's expensive, and even more so with the addition of the Sub, or more speakers. But, it's one of the best sounding bars out there, alone, and simply superb with the Sub. If you are looking for a sound bar set-up, and the price isn't a deterrent, this is definitely the way to go.;Great, but don't even think about buying it without the Sub
90;107.0;3.0;7.0;Overall, this is an excellent speaker, let down my limited connectivity options.\n\nWe also have a sub and a pair of Play 1's for a 5.1 system. On all these speakers the sound quality has been excellent. For TV watching, The sub is great, but we really need to jack up the levels of the Play 1's in order to notice them. Even then, its not too impressive. That said, the Sub and the Playbar provide very good immersive audio, but not quite the cinema surround sound experience you might hope for at this price.\n\nA few things to note:\n - only a single optical audio input is provided. For almost all televisions, this means that you will only get stereo (not surround sound), out of the TV if the signal comes in via HDMI. A smart TV's streaming internet content, and cable sources seem to provide 5.1 sound. Why? Who knows, but it seems to be a limitation of the majority of TVs. That being so, it would have made sense for Sonos to add a second optical input to this thing (e.g. for Bluerays or game systems). Sadly, I have to unplug the audio from my TV and into my PS3 when I want to watch a movie.\n\n - the ability to control the volume of the speaker through your existing TV remote is excellent -- who wants to dig out their cellphone, unlock it, find the Sonos app, launch it, find the TV group, and hit mute to mute the TV or change the volume? This was a very thoughtful idea.\n\n - you can stream music to all sonos speakers from your PC and mobile devices. However, you're locked into their walled garden. Although you can access 3rd party content (such as Spotify), you can't, for example, use the spotify app directly and for their excellent music discovery and and social features. Similarly, if you have a favorite podcasting app, you can't easily get it to play through a sonos system. Similarly, all of their speakers have a dedicated mute/pause and volume +/-. In retrospect -- extremely useful.\n\n - its impossible to stream audio many content sources. I can't stream youtube/hulu from my laptop or games audio from my PC. Although some sonos products have a line in, who wants to tether their laptop. And why take a high quality digital audio source and make it analog, and then digital again? It seems to defeat all of the benefits of having a pure digital wireless speaker system. It seems easily resolvable with a software update from sonos -- however, after many years (and many user's requesting this feature on their site's forum), it seems they don't have the will -- so don't hold your breath.\n\nHaving your choice of speaker system system dictate what you many and may not listen to, and how you may listen to it is a terrible thing. Shame on Sonos for not fixing this.;Sounds great. A some connectivity shortcomings.
118;108.0;5.0;7.0;"I have been a big fan of Sonos for awhile, already owning a Play:3, two Play:5's, and a Sub. I decided to buy the Playbar with another Sub, because I knew it would be exactly what I needed to upgrade a mediocre Vizio sound bar I had prior to this.\n\nThe sound quality of the bar is definitely great. I think you can compare it to a pair of Play:3's, which is a similar price point. I tried it without the Sub, and I can say that it does sound competent solo as you would expect. However, when you pair it with the Sub, it takes on a whole new life and the music becomes warm and rich. It is a lot of expense, but if you can get the pair, it is an almost perfect setup.\n\nThe greatest thing about the Playbar is that it is two devices in one. It has autoplay that kicks in when you turn on your TV, and the TV audio takes over. You can also use the Sonos app to play all of your favorite music services, podcasts, etc. All of the great Sonos features you know and love, and a great soundbar for your TV as well.\n\nThe big surprise that I had is that I could use my Logitech Harmony remote to control the volume. I didn't even know it had that feature when I bought it, and I expected I'd have to use the app to control the volume like my other Sonos devices. My Harmony was already set up to use the Vizio, so when I went through the Playbar setup process I was able to ""learn"" the Vizio volume +/- and mute. Now I can control the volume from my Harmony, and I didn't even have to reprogram it. The learning process is very simple.\n\nMounting this was super easy as well. I bought the Sonos kit separately for this, which comes with everything you need in the box. It would be nice if the mounting kit came with the Playbar given the price. However, some people likely won't need it, as they'll lay the Playbar in front of the TV.\n\nOverall I'm very pleased with this, as I am with all of my Sonos equipment. It just works, and it sounds great.";Exceeded My High Expectations
62;109.0;1.0;5.0;I have 3 Sonos Play 1 speakers that I love.  Recently ordered a new Sonos Playbar.  It showed up badly dented and with the internal packaging open.  Since the internal packaging was open and the speaker damaged, but the box undamaged and sealed it appears that Sonos took a returned speaker and put it in a new box.  Very disappointing from a company that sells a quality product.;I have 3 Sonos Play 1 speakers that I love. Recently ordered a new Sonos Playbar
63;110.0;2.0;5.0;"I am huge fan of Sonos and have been for several years and have six zones with their products currently. When an opportunity came up to add a home theater for a new area in my house I immediately thought Sonos Playbar because the room was only 230sq/ft, I ordered a new Sony 4K TV and Playbar and Sonos subwoofer and was waiting for a delivery date. I was so excited about the entire project that I decided to start reading about the connectivity options of the Playbar in anticipation for an afternoon of fun setting my new equipment, that's when I started reading comments from Playbar users on the Sonos website which pointed a glaring omission in the Playbar design. It appears that Sonos decided DTS or DTS-HD was not important enough to include support. You read correctly, the Sonos ""home theater"" product cannot decode one of home theater's finest digital sound encoding surround systems. I can't imagine being in a design meeting for a $700 piece of surround equipment and no one had enough pull to say ""this is wrong, let's find a way"". Needless to say I am canceling my $1400 Sonos Playbar/Subwoofer purchase and going with a conventional receiver & speaker setup. That Playbar sure would've looked nice.. too bad.";I was so excited about the entire project that I decided to start reading about the connectivity options of the Playbar in antic
83;111.0;4.0;6.0;"I am really reviewing the entire Sonos family. I started with just the Playbar and the Sub. They sounded fantastic, and they were ridiculously easy to install, so I ordered some more. They are expensive, but I justified the price on how easy they will be to take if I move, plus the money and aggravation I saved by not running wires, buying an amp, hiring a home theater installer, etc. You must look at the whole picture on cost.\n\nHere's my setup:\n1. In the closet with my router, the Sonos Bridge.\n2. In the family room, the Playbar and Sub.\n3. In the kitchen (the other end of a large space that includes the family room), a stereo pair of Play 3.\n4. In the master bedroom, a single Play 1 (but I will probably add one more to get stereo).\n\nWhat I like:\n\n1. Easy to setup. I used the Windows app, and just added each component. It recognized each one, asked some simple questions, and it was done. The setup program ""listened"" to my setup, and then adjusted the sub levels for me. The linking of a stereo pair was also simple.\n2. Easy to add a Spotify account. Easy to add internet radio feeds for local stations I prefer.\n3. Friends came over with their own iPhone and Android phones, downloaded the Sonos app, and we took turns running the playlist. It added an unexpected and fun social angle which reminded me of the early iPod days, when we took turns plugging in.\n4. I could group the kitchen and family room so they play the same source with no phase delay. It sounded great. For a party, I will group in the bedroom so the whole house has the same source.\n5. I guess I should have said first -- they sound fantastic. I am not an audiophile, but I do know what I like. This have a rich, full sound. Not sure how to describe. The sound is just feels ""complete"", if that makes sense.\n6. Two settings I have not tried yet, but sound useful: ""Night"" mode for when the rest of the family is sleeping, and ""Dialog"" mode that favors dialog over explosions, unlike today's movies.\n7. Using a modern TV as the input switcher is genius. You plug multiple HDMI inputs into the TV, and then take the digital audio from the TV to the Playbar. Boom. Just saved a couple grand on a receiver that would have been an expensive HDMI switcher.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n1. No Windows Phone app.\n2. No Windows 8 touch app.\n3. No support for Xbox Music service. In general, I hope Sonos realizes soon that Microsoft is not quite dead yet.\n4. No battery option. I wish the smallest speaker was rechargeable so I could temporarily move it elsewhere. I am going to try to order replacement power cords for the Play 1 and just strategically place them in other rooms.\n5. More mounting options for the Playbar would be nice.";I will never run speaker wire again
84;112.0;5.0;6.0;Love the sound. Bass is better that expected. Will add additional Sonos components to the system shortly Bought on Amazon as slightly used. No problem there. The problem was each Sonos component has a serial number and a registered owner. Amazon neglected to inform me of this prior to purchase. They also neglected to enclose the software that comes with it. Well, To my TOTAL SUPRISE nothing worked....correctly. I called Sonos, left my name and phone. Not only did they call back, the tech was GREAT. Amazing technology, even more amazing support. I am a fan!!!!;I have Bose, Yamaha & now Sonos.......The Sonos Play Bar(so far)
97;113.0;1.0;6.0;I was very dissatisfied with the sound quality considering the high price, I couldn't even tell the difference from it to the TV speakers, so I returned it, but the wireless capabilities were nice.;Sonos playbar
66;114.0;1.0;5.0;Don't drop $700 on a sound bar. You could get a decent $300 tuner that has wireless streaming and a bigger $400 center speaker that will sound better for the same cost. And absolutely don't buy this if you want a 5.1 surround setup. For that cost there are many better alternatives. The fact that anyone would make a $700 speaker that doesn't have regular speaker inputs blows my mind.;PRICE POINT IS WAY TOO HIGH
112;115.0;5.0;6.0;I have had lots of various speaker and entertainment systems over the past 20+ years (Bose, Klipsch, Polk, etc.) and I have to say for the price I am VERY impressed. I'll be honest in that you need more than the Soundbar by itself (definitely needs the SONOS sub and at least 2 play3's for a full system), but the ease of use, fact that it is wireless (does need an electrical outlet), and the versatility of the SONOS iPhone or Android app has me hooked.  I started with a single system (Playbar, Subwoofer, 2 Play 3s) and am now up to multiple systems through my house.  It can get expensive (and almost addictive as you will want it in every room), but well worth the money.  I highly recommend.;Simply Amazing!!!  SONOS is addictive!
73;116.0;3.0;5.0;I wanted to like this product, and the sound is pretty good when paired to 3's for surround and the subwoofer, but two glaring problems.\n1.  TV dialogue delay is off, no matter how much I adjust it. It is bothersome enough that I only use the soundbar when watching sports or something else that you can't see the actors mouths. Went back to the store I bought it at to see what they were doing and found they had the same problem, so they only demo it with sports, etc.\n2.  Only connects to certain TV's. So even if your TV has a digital audio out, it may not be compatible. Check Sonos' web site carefully before purchasing. Luckily I was able to return my TV and buy one that was compatible.  I eventually ended up with a Samsung.;Good sound, paired with 3's for surround effect.  But can't make TV dialogue match the video.
117;117.0;5.0;6.0;"I had a Sony 3D sound bar to pair with my 55"" Sony Bravia and I was looking for something a bit better. I visited Best Buy and the Magnolia guys demonstrated this for me and I was blown away! It is technologically advanced and innovative allowing you to connect to your router to sync up with your Ipad or Iphone to not only control but play music wirelessly. Plus the sound connected to your TV is awesome. Forget the cluttered look of a home theater system with a receiver and wires coming from every direction, this is one single bar connected to the TV with one wire. The set up could not have been simpler. Plus it syncs with any universal remote and paired up with my Harmony 900 nicely. The total set up to less than 10 minutes and I was up and running. I eventually would buy the other speakers to pair with this playbar but for now this does a great job on its own. My only concern is that it is pretty large and takes up the front of the TV but who cares. It does a great job and cranking it up, it blows away any 5.1 system!";Huge Sound from this awesome component! Nice addition to the room!
121;118.0;5.0;6.0;Update:  I've now purchased and paired the Playbar with the Sub from Sonos.  Wow.  Great sound.  Better sound.  This is a great pair...\n\nI bought the Sonos Playbar through Amazon a week before release.  About a month earlier I bought the Klipsch SB3 soundbar through Amazon (which is also excellent), but had to try the Playbar when I heard the release announcement as I have several other Sonos products in the house.\n\nI was so pleased with the Klipsch product, that I honestly was skeptical that the Playbar would be competitive.  The Klipsch comes with an excellent sub, so I expected the Playbar to have less bass, but the Klipsch bar itself is also excellent, so I didn't think the Playbar would be able to compete at the same pricepoint.\n\nHaving now spent several days with the Playbar, I have to say I'm impressed.  It's significantly smaller than the Klipsch product (which is good), yet equals the SB3 bar in sound and actually excels significantly in surround simulation.  I love the ability to finetune the Playbar output for Speech Enhancement and Night Mode, as well.\n\nI know I'll have to add the Sonos sub (another $699) to augment the bass output, but I have another Sonos zone in this same room (and high end speakers) that I'll be replacing with the Playbar and Sub, so the cost isn't a factor for me.\n\nWell done Sonos...;Pricey, but Excellent
76;119.0;4.0;5.0;Review edited.  Now I've got it working and it sounds nice.  It was a little difficult to configure but it can be setup in an area with an Internet connection & then moved where there is no Internet connection.

The manual seems to state that unless yuo buy the Sonos Connect and use it for on-line musci, there is no way to configure this bar.

Documentation is extremely poor.;doesn't work for home theater, only for streaming music
82;120.0;3.0;5.0;"Overall, I would say I am very happy with my purchase. The sound from this speaker is a 2000% improvement from what I had before from just my TV, but a few points below to mention that made me rate it only 3 stars.\n\n+ Connectivity to almost all my different music sources (mp3 library, Pandora, local FM radio) is incredibly simple.\n- I still have a CD library; cant really play that on this speaker.\n+ TV now sounds way richer.\n- I feel like I'm still missing out on a little something on my TV sound and I want to add the SUB, but at $700 for the sound bar I would have expected the SUB to be included, not be another $700 add-on.\n\nAnother drawback is that this speaker is ALWAYS ON. There is no OFF switch, no way for me to disable it other than unplugging it, It consumes a non-negligible 13W for just sitting there.";Great Sound and Connectivity
93;121.0;2.0;5.0;I'm sending back the Sonos Playbar we just bought. Audio DRM issues make it impossible to actually do what it promises for most people. Most (but not all) TVs take in multiple HDMI inputs from a variety of sources that can include surround sound. Most TVs have a handy optical audio out port that sends the sound from your TV to a more awesomer sound system...and most TVs change it into a lame 2-channel stereo signal on the way out. WTF? Is that to keep us from pirating the audio from Star Wars? The whole reason I got the Playbar and two additional Sonos speakers was to get surround (as they tout on their site and on Amazon). Will your TV pass through the full surround audio to your new Sonos Playbar? No real way of knowing. There is a partial list on the Sonos support site, but TV vendors don't list this feature (or even have a standard name for it), so good luck. If you are one of the lucky few with a magic TV that *does* pass through full 5.1, this is a great solution. That a big 'if' for most people.;Surround Probably Won't Work from You
98;122.0;5.0;5.0;If you want amazing sound and have $700 to burn, this is not the speaker for you. There's no low end whatsoever. Now if you have $1400 to burn then definitely get this and the Sonos Sub and you're good to go.;If you get the playbar get the sub too.
101;123.0;3.0;5.0;Purchased the Playbar with high expectations...perhaps too high.  It does sound good but definitely lacks bass.  I suppose I may splurge another $700 for the SUB but first...customer service is pretty poor.  I have been unable to download my iTunes library which is one of the main points for Sonos versus other systems. Sent an email to customer nearly 2 days ago and still waiting for a response.  I guess I got spoiled by Amazon's lightning quick Customer Service.  If Sonos doesn't contact me soon, good sound or not, the playbar is going back!;So far not too impressed...
103;124.0;5.0;5.0;I can't begin to say enough good things about the Sonos Playbar or Sonos as a whole.  The system works great.  The sound quality is very good, and the ability to listen to all my music as well as a host of online music sources makes the Sonos system great for anyone who loves music.\n\nI have always loved good music and nice speakers, I don't believe that the Sonos speakers are the best speakers I have heard or even that I own.  But they do sound great and when you pair the good sound with the ease of use of the system it is something that I would recommend to anyone.\n\nI own a Playbar and a Sonos Play:3 and a Sonos Play:5, they are all great.  I would warn anyone considering purchasing the Sonos Subwoofer it is extremely powerful.  While it sounds amazing, if you don't live in a single family home you may have trouble with your neighbors.  I returned my Sonos subwoofer because I realized I was never going to be able to play it more than at 25% without making my neighbors in my condominium very mad.  That being said all of the Sonos devices have good bass from the devices.\n\nI have the Sonos Playbar in my living room which is an open living room/kitchen.  It is plenty loud for the room and the bass sounds nice.  The bass isn't going to blow you away, but I do think the bass is definitely adequate without the sub.  Even the Play:3 and Play:5 sound good without the sub.\n\nI would recommend this product and all Sonos products to anyone who wants the flexibility to listen to music in various rooms and doesn't want to deal with the hassle and costs of putting wires in your walls/ceilings.;SONOS rocks!

The SONOS PLAYBAR is awesome.  The sound is fantastic and definitely improved the sound of our Aquos 46"" TV.  We started with that and then bought 2 PLAY3's and then a PLAY5.  The sound is awesome and it's easy to use.  Our house and T room is small so we didn't need the SUB Woofer but if you had a really large room I can see where that would be great.  Definitely a thumbs up!";SONOS PLAYBAR is a great addition and so easy to use and add on to!
108;126.0;4.0;5.0;Has made sound output from the television much more crisp. Cinematic events are much more theater-like. It is a little difficult to hit the right volumen with the controller's slider because the range is compressed. Speech enhancement feature for actors who mumble or speak with a foreign accent does actually work. Expensive. Worth it. Overall a wonderful addition to the home viewing experience.;Makes Live TV More Alive
109;127.0;4.0;5.0;Excellent product, and it should be excellent given the price.  This unit is a lot of money, but you get what you pay for.  Extremely easy setup and dovetailed instantly with the other components in my Sonos system.  Highly recommended system if you like home automation, and streaming music from essentially every music source on the planet.\n\nThe only glitch was my 8 year old television's digital fiber optic connection was too old to work with this.  Tech support quickly provided a workaround and it runs out of my DVD/BlueRay perfectly.  Will be upgrading the TV soon -- possibly the highest praise I can give this product is that I'm more than willing to upgrade my television in order to get the full benefit of this unit's output.\n\nIf you dropped the price a bit, I would have a houseful of Sonos equipment - multiple units in every room.  Volume people, make your money on volume.;Fantastic Sound
110;128.0;5.0;5.0;I was pleasantly surprised with this system. I also bought the sub and two play:3's for 5.1. Without these additional speakers I was still completely blown away at the surround sound like effect. I owned a high end receiver and some very nice speakers which I sold for $1700 on ebay. Recently I had a career change which requires me to move constantly and live in apartments. Being a neat freak and not liking the sit of wires, keeping my stereo would have been nearly impossible.\n\nI was very pleased with this speaker, enough to buy a second which I am using for my computer (Call of Duty rocks). Typically speakers are tweaked for either movies and tv or music listening, this is something that Sonos did a great job at fixing.\n\nThe only minor gripes I have are cosmetic. The black felt appears a bit grey in high light environments and squashes with my full black tv.\n\nFor being very picky about sound, this gets my recommendation for sure!;Better than my $3k stereo. Got ride of AV receiver and cords!!
122;129.0;4.0;5.0;"The Sonos Playbar is a major improvement to the TV room audio experience in our home.  I had been thinking of investing in better audio for our TV room for some time, and as a Sonos Play:3 owner was in the back of my mind hoping they would do something in this space.\n\nAs noted, I do already have a Play:3 in a different room from where my TV is located, connected with a Sonos Bridge.  Having the bridge already setup made the Playbar setup pretty simple, since it could connect to it via wifi.\n\nSetup was pretty straightforward, with a few caveats:\n\n-I unboxed the unit and placed on my Home AV cabinet, in front of my TV.  My Samsung plasma (2005 vintage) is not wall mounted. The Playbar unit fits easily in front of TV\n\n-connect optical S/PIDF cable from TV to Playbar.\n-power cable.  Wished the power cable was a few feet longer but was able to adjust things to make it work\n-the setup instructions included with the unit are simple to understand.\n\nAfter physical setup, I launched iphone Sonos app, and began to walk through a setup wizard to get Playbar paired with the Bridge, and setup Playbar to respond to my TV remote volume (I have Dish network and use their universal remote).  The Playbar ""learns"" the IR commands from your TV remote as part of this process, so you can continue to use that same remote.  The only issue with this process came when I went to disable the Samsung TV built-in speakers.  The TV continues to receive volume +/- commands from the remote even after its built-in speakers are turned off, but pops up a ""Not Supported in this Mode"" dialog box every time I try to control volume.  Long story short, the only way to work around this problem was to go back and re-do the Playbar IR learning process, but choosing a different set of IR codes not supported by the TV.  FYI, the Dish Network universal remote adapts to this well, it has a mode where only volume+/- keys can be assigned to control an AV receiver and not the TV.\n\nAfter setup was complete, use of Playbar is pretty smooth sailing. The playbar offers a major improvement to our TV audio, and I find myself seriously considering adding Sonos subwoofer and additional Play:3s to our TV room to get a true 5.1 experience.  The ability to ""group"" my Play:3 and Playbar together offers some great new experiences to my family:  1)we can stream music from huge range of internet services and have it play both in the TV room and Play:3 (living room) at the same time, 2)I can now play TV audio on my Play:3 in the living room, which is very useful when there is a big football or baseball game on TV and I want to continue to hear what is happening when I am in the living room.\n\nIt is worth noting that except for the IR remote volume+/- and hardware volume +/- keys on the Playbar unit, all control of the playbar is done via PC/mobile/tablet apps.  For example there is a setting to make it easier to hear voices in the app.  At times I find myself wishing that it was possible to access these features via IR remote or via buttons on the Playbar hardware, instead of having to launch an app.  But all-in-all, I highly recommend this unit if you are looking to enhance your TV room audio experience.";Major Upgrade for my TV Room Audio Experience
127;130.0;5.0;5.0;"This is a great product for anyone who desires fantastic sound quality and a totally wireless install.  It has been the perfect accessory to compliment our Samsung LED TV.  I mounted the Playbar on the wall directly below my 46"" Samsung LED TV, and it looks and sounds amazing.\n\nThe Playbar was very easy to install and connects wirelessly via our Router with the Sonos Bridge (purchased separately). The set up instructions were simple and easy to follow.  Note that the Sonos Bridge is a required component and needs to be hard-wired to the router, and the Playbar needs to be in wireless range of the router.\n\nSetup took 15 minutes, and I now have the ability to wirelessly control the volume and inputs, as well as song selections from (Pandora, iTunes, TV, etc) via my iPhone or iPad from anywhere in the house is great - especially when the kids have cranked up the volume--- the sound quality at low and high volumes is crisp and clear for both music, TV, and Action Movies.\n\nThe sound quality and bass is fantastic for our living room (12' x 16'), and is a huge improvement over our older surround system, and is a much cleaner install.  I have been able to remove 3 speakers, a subwoofer, and the legacy amplifier, which has dramatically cleaned up my living room.\n\nI am looking forward to expanding my system to include the Sonos Connect to tap into my in-home stereo/speaker system, so that I can control the sound for the whole house from my iPhone or iPad.  Great product, especially for homes without fully integrated AV systems.\n\nOverall great product I would highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys listening to great audio.";Fantastic sound quality and easy set up

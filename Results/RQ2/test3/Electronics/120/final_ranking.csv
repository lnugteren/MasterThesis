0;69;55;0.8954178467171523;this lens is a great buy it is a fraction of the cost of the nikon equivalent with such a great discount you have to expect somewhat less performance however this lens still does a great job n nthis lens is very sharp above f 4 0 at 2 8 is tends to have a some chromatic abberation ca you will be able to see this a bit at 100 zoom levels in some pictures it is not bad but it is present n ni ve also noticed that the lens has a bit of edge softness when i m shooting in a high light setting i e outside or when i m dousing a subject in studio strobes the photos are perfectly metered i checked the camera s meter against my handheld light meter and it just seems that when there is a lot of light the elements in the lens ghost the edges when i realized that this was n t ca but was more like internal flare from the elements i decided to experiment on how to fix this what i ve found fixes this is shooting a stop down i typically just set my nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href nikon d7000 dp b0042x9lc4 ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf8 nikon d7000 a nbsp to shoot one stop lower than metered when i use this lens in a high light setting i ve noticed that i do n t get the edge glare and then i can easily add the light back by adjusting the exposure in nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href adobe photoshop lightroom 3 dp b003739dvy ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf8 adobe photoshop lightroom 3 a this might sound like a lot of work but if you automate the import settings in lightroom you never know the difference n neven though i ve just talked at length about the softness issues of this lens i need to point out that the issue is rather minimal and most people wo n t notice it i had some prints made after getting this lens without any corrections and i could not notice the softness if you are seeking a perfectly tack sharp image get a prime lens less lens elements means less interference with the light n nthe zoom range of this lens is very nice 28mm on a dx sensor is really like 42mm on a full frame and 75mm is actually 112 5mm 113 it is still a nice zoom range though i shot a wedding a few weeks ago and i used this lens about 85 of the time the only other lens i used was an 18 200mm zoom to take longer shots and get the more wide angle looks n nthe auto focus is not as good as in a nikon lens this does not mean the auto focus is not good it just means that nikons are a little quicker do n t hunt as much and are a little quieter that said this lens still focuses well it is not distractingly loud even in a quiet room i can hear the motor because i have my head up against the camera however when i ve asked no one else can hear it really i am still very satisfied with the auto focus n nthe construction of the lens is plastic it does not have a cheap feel nor does it feel flimsy the plastic body keeps the weight down which is nice after carrying this thing around for 8 hours i was glad it did n t weigh twice as much n nthe lens hood is nice but it is a little stiff going on and coming off i m always a little concerned i might snap it n nthe rear lens cap is worthless i replaced it with a nikon rear cap and never looked back the front lens cap is great and it works just as well as the nikon brand n noverall i would purchase this lens again i have been very happy with it at less that 1 3 the cost of the equivalent nikon lens i believe this product performs quite well if you train yourself with this lens you will produce very nice photos and be happy with it n n cheers
1;41;41;0.8864928432165083;intro n ni heard how sharp this lens was and wanted a backup to the beautiful sharp and well built tamron 24 70 2 8 vc model that i have i am an advanced amateur and do shoot a few weddings events family portraits etc and i wanted a backup or something i could consider a contender of my workhorse should some mechanical mishap or accident happen i did not buy this lens on amazon rather i purchased it from a private owner professional photographer in almost brand new condition for 350 usd if you look around mostly online you can get this lens a lot cheaper used just beware as i found out you have no warranty if you buy from a second party n ncurrently as of this writing i shoot nikon with a d700 and d90 in the comments section i will post a url so you can check out some sample pics i took with this lens so far amazon does n t allow urls in the body of reviews for some reason n nthe good n ni love the 2 8 aperture i do n t know if i will ever shoot another lens that does n t have a constant high aperture low f stop number available i love the sharp pictures i lucked out and it appears to me the lens i purchased and tested is indeed sharp and the focus is right on the money great iq n ni have or had three other lenses by tamron and all are sharp and i am a fan 24 70 2 8 vc 70 300 vc zoom and the old 90mm macro sold great lens super slow i recommend any of these lenses including the 28 75 being reviewed n nthe bokeh is decent not wonderful but not bad imo bokeh can be an opinionated issue n nit is very lightweight it hardly adds any weight to my d700 this is a good thing n nthe bad n ni never had a problem with my nikon d700 and i owned it for about a year when i put on this tamron lens i shot a few shots and the auto focus froze and the buttons on the camera play menu info etc would not work the lcd would n t come on i have a grip i monkeyed with the nikon grip buttons and everything came back i am blaming the grip official nikon and not the lens necessarily but it was weird and has n t happened again yet just thought i would mention it in case anyone else experienced this n nthe day after i purchased the lens it seems the zoom lock slider button is broken it will engage in the lens but when i try to engage it back up it just sits there and does n t snap into place and freely moves back and forth not a big deal and i may eventually just put a drop of elmer s glue on it to keep it in place as i doubt i ll ever use it n nthe zoom is very stiff i have used it and tried to break it in by moving it back and forth zooming excessively 28mm to 75mm and back again it seems to have loosened up somewhat this seems to be a big complaint about this lens n nthe hood easily cracks the hood that comes with it has a big crack in it i do n t know if i did this or if maybe it came like that and i am just noticing it however it does appear kind of flimsy and weak in the spot it cracked in i ordered another on amazon for around 22 taxes shipping oem we ll see how this one does n nslow focusing this lens does slow focus and hunt in low light it is supposed to be a fast lens in low light do n t hold your breath it however has been acceptable so far in my limited testing just not fast nor super slow just slow enough n nsummary and rating n ni like this lens i have liked all my tamron lenses i especially love the tamron 24 70 2 8 vc lens it is much bigger and heavier but the build is no comparison the focusing is fast on the 24 70 as it has a usm motor finally weather sealing and vc is the name of the game if you can afford it and are on the fence i would highly recommend the tamron 24 70 2 8 vc this is my workhorse but if you are looking for a cheap walkaround lens that has great image quality this lens is el cheapo with outstanding iq n nthis lens is light constant aperture with did i say great image quality and will work on a dx crop sensor and fx full frame body the build is average at best although i experienced some problems ymmv i also purchased this lens semi new so it was used once or twice for all those factors i am giving this lens a 4 star rating i would highly recommend it to the hobbyist occasional to advanced amateur and maybe semi pro you ca n t beat the image quality for the money and that s the most important thing as long as the lens works semi pros and pros weddings and sports i would probably look elsewhere or have this available as a backup or secondary lens the slower focusing and build worries me
2;7;111;0.8829913328644751;i am someone who swears by canon and would not buy any other lens tamron has made me swallow my pride with this lens i have to admit this is one gorgeous piece of glass especially for the price and the 2 8 aperture comes with a hood body kinda feels a little cheap but to me all that matters is the quality of the pictures and i am completely satisfied thoroughly impressed with the quality of the photos n nvery sharp images at 2 8 through out the zoom range i even took a portrait with this lens at 65 70mm 1 250 2 8 iso 400 with my eos 3 35mm one of the best portraits i ve taken incidentally this is the first photograph i clicked with this lens and i have to admit that i am floored honestly i am toying with the idea of buying one more for my 20d n ngorgeous background blur which is one of the factors that impressed me the most and the dof is good enough to focus the subject completely i like to focus on the subject s eye and have enough dof to cover the entire body depth of the subject rather than blurring out any part of the body this lens serves the purpose and would give the portrait a really professional feel n nthe other factor that impressed me is the minimum focusing distance i took some macro shots in a tide pool in point loma san diego and i am thoroughly impressed with the sharpness 2 8 as well as the distance i think i went as close as 7 8 inches did not measure as seen by my friend and was happy with that too n nin short if you are toying with the idea of buying the 24 70 2 8l which was the case with me and want to leave that for an upgrade you wo n t regret buying this lens i think i will wait for the canon 1 2 3 rebate for the 24 70 2 8 and will still keep this lens as a part of my kit n n5 stars must buy n n nupdate on 17 mar 2007 n ndecided to go for an upgrade to canon 24 70 f 2 8l and conducted amateurish tests side by side at various focal lengths and apertures all else being the same ended up returning the canon and decided to keep the tamron the canon was certainly a good copy tacccckkkk sharp but could n t beat the sharpness out of the tamron the tamron came out much sharper across wide open apertures centers edges as examined by the naked eye at 100 image size and equal sharpness between the two lenses at f 8 and above stunning image quality in both the canon locked the exposure much more consistently than the tamron which moved a half a stop or so while trying to focus the only two areas where canon beat tamron was n 1 canon focussed silently and much more smoothly compared to the tamron n 2 build quality canon is really built like a tank cant think of any other word tamron feels cheap and plasticky when compared to the canon n nfinally i did n t feel like i was getting much value for 800 more as my tamron was already giving superior tack sharp image quality however for 1 3rd the price 1 3rd the weight i decided it was too pricy and upgrade and returned the canon go tamron n n nupdate on 23 nov 2007 n nalmost 2 years with this lens could n t be more satisfied this lens has never failed me during multiple trips in extreme conditions of heat cold and extreme s california wild fire winds no dust or other issues ni did notice that images were soft after f 16 due to diffraction but i do not think that is the lens fault images at f 22 and f 32 are very soft and unacceptable for professional prints or enlargements above 8x10 when shot at 8mp 20d but that was more my fidgeting to see what happens at those apertures i almost never use anything narrower than f 13 so it doesnt concern me overall very satisfied with this purchase this one is a keeper even if i buy the 24 105l or 24 70l
3;76;71;0.8714284056963607;so you know where this review is comong from i am an amateur i have a canon xsi 450d and about 1 5 years of dslr experience ni thought that the new kit i got was so difficult to learn but it turns out that my kit lens was just not so good n nthe fact that a petal hood is included makes a nice plus and the lens cap is the type you squeeze together from the front so it s easy to get on off with the hood in place i leave it on 99 of the time good protection n nthis tamron was a great choice for an all around lens nusually wide enough and can zoom in for nice bokeh in the background of portraits nthe sharpness especially on a crop sensor is outstanding from f 4 on up at f2 8 it s a touch soft for me but still very usable up to 8x10 prints much sharper wide open than the venerated canon 50mm 1 8 ii even at f 2 8 i sold my nifty fifty after getting this lens becasue it is more flexible and i never liked the shots i got between 1 8 and 2 8 anyway too soft n nin professional reviews this lens is sharper than the canon 24 70 f2 8 l i have confirmed that in a store on my body i compared their l to the tamron with a magazine full of text the text especially away from center was much sharper with the tamron than the canon l much n nso 1 3 the cost and half the weight the canon lens is weather sealed and moslty a metal chassis if those two items are important to you then get the canon otherwise the tamron is the way to go n ni also considered the sigma 24 70 f2 8 but the weight filter size and flare resistance were all better with the tamron n nthis lens works great my only caveat is that the zoom movement is opposite to the canon lenses which is a little disconcerting when you switch but not a big deal
4;88;47;0.8691945524576166;i purchased this lens because i could n t budget three times the cost for the canon equivalent i particularly wanted this lens for use in photographing weddings as well as photographing wildflowers using the shallow depth of field offered by the f 2 8 n nit s a great lens for photographing flowers and i m pleased with the outcome when using the lens at f 2 8 i m not so thrilled with the quality of images when shooting landscapes though they seem a little soft at f 11 and greater i have n t had the opportunity to use the lens for portraiture in low light situations n ni do want to mention something that occurred after using this lens for an entire day when i put on my canon 24 105 l glass lens the next day i started getting error messages that my camera had lost communication with the lens this was my first time ever receiving a message like this and the only thing i had done different was use the tamron lens n ni cleaned the contacts and so far so good then i read in an online forum that some tamron and sigma lenses come out of the factory with some sort of oil on their contacts and this can cause problems i certainly did n t want to destroy my 7d by using a cheap lens so this was a concern the contact cleaning seems to have done the trick i hope it does n t occur again n nall in all it s a good lens if you re on a tight budget but if you can afford the more expensive l glass go for it there is a difference i ll try to remember to report back again after using the lens for portraiture
5;22;18;0.8632233342636192;i have owned this lens since 2013 and i love it i bought this after realizing the limitations of my 18 55mm kit lens on my rebel t3 i wanted a zoom for the flexibility that it offers and at a fixed aperture i researched lenses for a month before deciding to go with this one and i have been very pleased i like the 28 75 focal length as it is pretty close to the 24 70 focal length of canon s l series lens and both have the 2 8 aperture obviously the canon 24 70 l is going to be a higher quality lens but i was surprised at the great picture quality of this tamron lens for so much less money n ni have found the lens to produce images with great color contrast beautiful bokeh and sharpness i did notice some vignetting which seems more noticeable now that i have upgraded my camera to a full frame 6d in the bright sunlight the vignetting is more noticeable but nothing too distracting i usually crop in a little and its good n nthe focus is n t nearly as fast as canon s l series but it is n t painfully slow like the canon 50mm 1 8 either same with the noise it makes some noise focusing but it has n t ever bothered me or disrupted a photo n noverall i love this lens it remains on my camera the majority of the time i may in time upgrade to the 24 70 canon l but right now i see no reason to do so as i am getting great results with this lens
6;8;24;0.8533267892249933;first of all this lens is fantastic there are a few reasons why and i will go over them but if you are looking for a great walk around lens that is nice and fast look no further this lens is heavy built well and produces wonderful images n nvisit tamron s site to download the lens guide pdf http www tamron usa com lenses prod 2875mm asp ad image 0 n nlet s get down to brass tacks the pros and cons of this lens i will tell you why i like this lens and how i use it n ni am a working photographer i earn a living shooting weddings and events in hampton roads virginia this lens helps me earn money because it produces great results in a wide range of applications to be truthful i push the limits of both my camera and the lighting situations i find myself in and would consider my knowledge at an expert level n nfirst there must be a basis for comparison lenses are not created equal and the price of a lens is volatile that is to say that once a professional level of optics are attained very small advances in performance can come at a very high cost ntherefore i consider the category sensor size the lens is designed to work with distortion chromatic aberration aperture and price in that order n ncategory constant f2 8 28 75 full frame lens nthis lens is competing with other lenses with constant aperture at f2 8 with a focal length between 16 75 tamron ndoes offer a weather sealed version of this lens for around 1100 it has a pezio drive and is directly competing with the nikon 17 55mm f 2 8g ed if af s dx lens you can find these two lenses here n nnikon http www amazon com nikon 17 55mm 2 8g ed if nikkor dp b000144i2q 1399 ntamron http www amazon com nikon 17 55mm 2 8g ed if nikkor dp b000144i2q 1099 n nsensor size nno the lens does not have a sensor in it but it is made for a full frame camera you can use this lens on an apsc sensor size which is good some even believe that you will have better results using a ff lens on an apsc sensor because of the crop factor pulling the sharpest part of the lens the center area into focus and discarding the edges of the lens n ndistortion ndistortion this is a legacy designed lens this is important because the lens was designed when cameras did not have built in line correction and micro correction moreover this lens was designed when the average consumer did not have access to programs like dxo optics pro 9 and light room both of these programs have built in profiles to correct lens distortion on specific camera bodies n nthis is important to you because it was designed when the lens had to be good optically because corrections in post production were very difficult this lens hit the market in the at least 2003 n nthis lens has some soft areas wide open at 28mm they are mainly in the edges of the lens center is tack sharp this is not a bad thing though remember that an aperture of 2 8 should give a very shallow depth of field and an extremely narrow focus therefore one would expect the edges to be soft i absolutely love this dxo optics has tested this lens and approves of it but do n t let someone else s numbers confuse you all their numbers mean is that it is a great lens for the price i m sure that someone will begin comparing this statement to some 4k plus lens but remember this lens is not competing in the 4k arena it does however hold up very well n nin my use i have seen very little to no distortion i take portraits of individuals and groups so i would not expect to see a lot of distortion if i were taking photo of buildings any distortion the lens has would become more apparent n nchromatic aberration nso far i have seen nothing that i would say detracts form the image the lens is prone to flaring when pointed toward direct bright light like a sunset but what better of an image to get than a silhouette of a bride and groom with a natural lens flair for me its great maybe not so much for you n naperture nthis is an f2 8 constant throughout the zoom range right yes but do you know what that means are all 2 8 s equal the answer is both yes and no to make this simple aperture is nothing more than a mathematical ratio it actually looks like this f 1 2 8 we just drop the 1 and display it as f2 8 n nso now that you know it s a ratio what is it competing it is comparing goal length to the diameter of the aperture or how big of a whole the aperture has at a known focal length to find out how big your aperture is in mm just divide the focal length by the current aperture so a focal length of 100mm at an aperture of 2 would be 100mm 2 50mm this means that your aperture would be physically open by 50mm at a focal length of 100mm n nthis is important because as ratios are always comparing aperture diameter to focal length they should be constant across different lenses so you could say that a 50mm prime at an f2 has an aperture diameter of 25mm the example above showed that a lens with a focal length of 100mm at an f2 would be 50mm in diameter this is correct but would be costly to build and quite heavy instead many lenses have an articulated aperture which is to say that their maximum aperture changes throughout the zoom range you will usually see something like an 18 55 f3 5 5 6 that means that on the wide end of the lens the max aperture is 3 5 so 18 3 5 5 14mm and 55 5 6 9 82mm n nthis lens example from above is almost always going to be bad in low light and would probably be a kit lens the tamron lens that this article is about is a 24 75 f2 8 which means that the max aperture on the wide end is 24 2 8 8 57mm and on the zoom end the aperture diameter is 75 2 8 26 78mm let s compare them ncommon 18 55 f3 5 5 8 max aperture diameter wide angle 5 14mm max aperture zoomed in 9 82mm ntamron 24 75 f2 8 max aperture diameter wide angle 8 57mm max aperture zoomed in 26 78mm n nbigger diameter aperture is better because it gives you more usable light in low light situations it also gives you more control on depth of field n nprice it s 500 this is a steal for this lens it works in many situations and gives you the most control over your creativity considering the alternatives it is about or less the price i have truly enjoyed this lens and you will too my suggestion is to buy the body of the camera you want do not buy a bundled lens and get this lens as your walk around lens

7;43;19;0.8466733267425309;i bought this lens expecting what i got a solid walk around touring lens that takes good not great quality photos i do n t want to lug around a heavy and expensive canon lens when i m out and about taking leisure photos because if something breaks i am out 500 with this lens and versus 1500 or more for a canon l lens this lens is currently paired with my 5d mk iii but i took some test pictures on my wife s t5i below is my impression from both n nbuild the build quality is sturdy it does n t feel cheap so much as middle of the road in build definitely a higher quality build than the canon ef s lenses i ve dealt with but nowhere near as solid as a canon l series there is a lot of what feels like quality plastic on the body and the focus and focal length adjustments have a nice rubberized feel n npicture quality the pictures i took with my 5d mk iii were very good at f 2 8 they were generally sharp although there was some softness in the middle and a bit of vignetting and really nice compression in the unfocused areas bokeh at f 4 the sharpness was pretty fantastic through out the photos and the majority of the vignetting was gone however so was a lot of that great compression i found at f 2 8 over all the pictures were good i have no complaints on my wife s t5i this lens really demonstrated to her what her camera was capable of the results were generally the same as the 5d mk iii considering the lower pixel count however the vignetting was almost non existent at f 2 8 probably due to the crop and the pictures appeared to be a bit sharper in the center at f 2 8 as well i would say this lens performs best in terms of overall picture quality on crop frame cameras n nauto focus this is why i am knocking the lens a star between both camera s i have about a 25 keeper rate using autofocus i m noticing a lot of back focusing with it in auto focus it also has some problems finding a focus on targets that are close but still outside of the 13 minimum focus distance on the t5i the autofocus was slower than the 5d mk iii but not by a significant amount on both cameras when the autofocus hit without back focus it hit well as the pictures were great n noverall it s a good lens although do n t buy it expecting to get your pictures put on national geographic i would recommend this lens for two types of people people with full frame camera s wanting a lower cost walk around lens or people with consumer grade crop sensor camera s canon rebels wanting to experience what a higher quality piece of glass can do before jumping up to a higher quality crop sensor or full frame camera
8;101;76;0.8442390703458097;now let me say first and foremost that i am not a professional photographer by any means but i am a decent amateur photographer and read up on this lens for months before i pulled the trigger and bought it my only regret i wished i would have done it sooner so that i could have enjoyed it longer the reviews on this site were extremely helpful along with the images people have uploaded taken with the lens after reading this lens review and the ones here here is my own i own the canon rebel xsi n ncons n no is image stabilization at first i thought this would be a problem but it s really not what it does do is make you really take your time and make you a better photographer i do wish it came with it for that just in case moment but the lens is sharp enough and heavy enough you can overcome this very minor thing n n a tad noisy yes it can be a bit noisy but it s not as bad as what i had read on a few reviews very minor but compared to my 18 55 kit lens i did notice it but it s not enough to take away from the image quality of this lens n n focus can hunt sometimes but it s a very rare thing i have seen in the 200 images i ve taken so far with the lens out of all of those images it s done it to me twice that s it n npros everything else n nthe cons i noted above are more of a hey you need to know type of thing but they are not enough for you to not think about buying this lens i have used it in low light sports shots with my daughter at soccer nature shots sunsets sunrises and they have all turned out just fine would i have liked to own the 24 70l lens sure but at 1350 vs 381 not even a 2nd thought n nread the reviews on here read the slrgear review and then buy this lens
9;93;52;0.8362178239085942;i am a wildlife photographer and my walk around lenses are not other folks normal lenses i e 300mm 400mm and 500mm i have a canon 17 40mm lens that i use for landscapes etc but i needed wanted a lens in this focal length for general use and a fast lens in the f 2 8 range i rented the canon 24 70 a couple of times and really liked it but was having a hard time with the price of that lens after reading the reviews on this lens i decided to give it a try after all i could return it if not pleased n ni am not one to shy away from expensive lens purchases but i am so happy with this tamron lens all i can say is wow it is great and every bit as good as the canon i am a loyal canon user so for me this is really saying something it is not as heavy or as large as the canon equivalent lens but works perfectly on my canon 7d and 1d markiv camera bodies n nthis lens will not be returned and is in my camera bag or on one of my camera bodies every time that i go out at home it stays on my 7d for quick around the house images of the grandson or whatever so very pleased
10;84;23;0.8284097262120732;i spent quite a bit of time researching what sort of lens would give me the very best value as a budget but sharp high quality walk around lens for my new canon 70d and this lens just kept coming up side to side comparisons between this lens and the far more expensive canon ef 24 70 f2 8l lens were very very comparable and in fact in some cases the tamron even bested the l series super lens from canon with 2 8 all the way through and supposedly just tack sharp i was super excited to get this lens and thus far it has definitely met and exceeded my expectations at full focal length there is great bokeh with the nice fast 2 8 aperture and at less than 500 for this level of sharp image quality it was a no brainer awesome lens will update in the future after i have had a little bit more time with this baby n nedit n nunfortunately i m not going to be able to keep this lens i ve really liked it very sharp photos all around good build quality lots of little details like the lock button to prevent the lens from creeping down as it hangs from your neck as other zoom lenses i have used have tended to do lots of stuff like that overall it really is a great lens for the price especially for that fast 2 8 aperture all the way through but i kept getting some sort of electronic communication error between the lens and the camera a 70d whenever i was trying to shoot video sometimes it would function properly recording video for maybe 30 seconds sometimes several minutes but every time it would just stop recording and give some error like ensure lens is properly attached this would n t do so i packed her up and sent her off to tamron in new york for repair then they told me that i had purchased a gray market lens and refused to service it whatsoever so i have my hands tied for the couple of weeks that i have used it it has been great but i m going to have to send it back i need it for video too not just wonderfully sharp photos not sure if i will try another one yet this time from an authorized seller so i can actually get it serviced if i have to again or if i will go for another brand
11;1;7;0.8261842254675179;i have never bought a non canon lens because i just love the look feel and optical quality of the canon line particularly the l series lenses but i kept reading glowing reviews about this lens on multiple websites so i went out and took a look n nfirst impression the build quality is not as good as a canon l series lens duh it costs about 1 4 as much for goodness sake this is a plastic lens not metal but i must admit that the build quality was pretty darn good better i think than the sigma lenses i ve seen fit and finish was very nice and tight i d give the build quality a 4 5 not bad i figured i could live with it n nnext i put the lens on my camera i d read reviews complaining about the speed of the focusing it may not be quite as quick as my 200 f2 8 l series lens but it was pretty darn good and for my purposes plenty fast a 4 5 5 n ni d read reviews complaining about the noise and the fact that the af was not usm i thought the af worked very quietly not at all distracting and barely discernable noise not an issue n nthen i took pictures with the lens and i was absolutely floored how in the world did tamron manage to produce a lens that performed so well optically for such a reasonable price beautiful contrast excellent resolution gorgeous colors and extremely sharp particularly above f2 8 but f2 8 is very good as well n nobviously the first comparison that comes to mind is between this lens and the canon 24 70 f2 8 l i would say i kid you not that this lens is in every respect optically the equal of the canon or better than the canon i could not believe it n ni tested this lens directly against a brand new copy of the canon 24 70 f2 8l method i tested both lenses on a tripod f 2 8 and 8 0 28mm 50mm and 70mm target limestone wall 9 5 feet parallel to the sensor plane remote release employed no mirror lockup center and all four corners were evaluated to my naked eye on a monitor using 100 crops both lenses were new copies received within the last 7 days n nthe limestone wall lent itself perfectly to evaluating sharpness and subtle contrast and color rendition there was enormous detail present in the wall with subtle colorations present n nfindings n n28mm f8 tamron definitely sharper in the center and corners n n28mm f2 8 tamron definitely sharper in the center and corners n n50mm f8 tamron slightly sharper in the center and very slightly sharper in corners n n50mm f2 8 tamron slightly sharper in center and equal in corners n n70mm f2 8 canon sharper in center and at corners incidentally noted was inability of tamron to focus as sharply as i was able to achieve with manual focusing n n70mm f8 tamron sharper in center with canon slightly sharper in corners n nsome have said that there is less flare with the canon but if you use the lens hood that should not be a problem i did n t notice excessive flare in my copy n nadmittedly there is significant copy to copy variation in both the canon and the tamron but my findings convinced me that at 1 4 the price and with the tamron weighing 1 pound less than the canon that the tamron was the lens for me optically 5 5 n ni can not recommend this lens highly enough it is the first non canon lens i have owned and i am thrilled
12;15;5;0.7808287123640895;got my digital rebel xt 350d about a week and a half ago and was deciding between this tamron 28 75 f 2 8 the canon 24 85 and the canon 28 135is and for my money this became the hands down choice i researched this decision for a good month and a half the digital rebel xt was not yet released in the us so i had some time to decide and my goal was to buy a lens to start out the xt with that was able to bring out the true power of the new 8mp xt the lens is faster and better quality than the canon 24 85 and although it is n t as long range as the canon 28 135is it is smaller lighter cheaper and feels better on the rebel than the 28 135 for everyday use n nif you are looking for a solid lens to cover most of your subjects from telephoto to portraits to some strikingly sharp up close macro shots and be able to leave it on the camera without much hassle this is the lens for you as far as image quality goes this lens is comparable to the much much pricier canon 24 70l series and furthermore it is smaller and lighter than the l series n ni was skeptical at first about buying any third party lens and i still am but this specific lens speaks for itself the lens speed was the final straw in my decision at f 2 8 this lens is quite a bit faster than the canon 24 85 f 3 5 4 5 and it comes with the tamron 6 year warranty i bought this lens for 399 and it was worth every penny n nif you are looking in the long range for setting yourself up with a multi lens system this lens fits quite well without much overlap with other high quality lens i plan on getting a canon 50mm f 1 4 for fast portraits a canon 50mm macro for super close shots and the canon 70 200l for longer range shots to round out my ability to shoot a variety of subjects the only overlap with the tamron 28 75 is the 70 75 range which is nonconsequential to me hope this was helpful
13;18;106;0.7632042847151493;i was skeptical about the rave reviews and have had mixed luck in getting sharp copies of canon and sigma lenses but decided to give tamron a try i tested the lens on both a full frame 5d comparing to my canon 24 105mm l lens and on a cropped frame xt comparing to my canon 17 85mm is lens i was very pleasantly surprised that once stopped down a little this tamron lens is ultra sharp and the focusing is right on for both near and far objects as carefully as i tried i could not manually focus this lens any more accurately even in the bright viewfinder of the 5d than the autofocus and in most cases my best manual focus attempt was much softer than autofocus not only is the lens sharp it has the same eye popping contrast that is sometimes found on the best l lenses details in the image have a 3d quality not usually seen in cheap lenses n ncomparisons n n28mm nthe tamron has usable sharpness wide open at f2 8 but gets super sharp in one stop down to f4 and slightly better by f5 6 it is just as sharp in the middle as my excellent canon 24 105 when wide open at f4 but not as sharp near the edges on the 5d at f5 6 both lenses are essentially equal over the whole full frame on the 5d at 28mm on the xt the tamron sharpness greatly exceeds the canon 17 85 lens at f4 5 5 6 and f8 over the whole frame the canon lens is not soft but the tamron is just eye popping sharp n n50mm nsharpness of the tamron at f2 8 is less than at 28mm but still usable on smaller prints maybe 8x10 sharpness increases greatly by f4 and is almost as sharp as the wide open canon 24 105 again at f5 6 both lenses are essentially equal over the whole full frame of the 5d comparing to the canon 17 85 on the xt the tamron is slightly sharper at f5 6 and gets sharper still at f8 over the whole cropped frame n n75mm nhere the f2 8 is quite soft in my opinion maybe ok for a 4x6 but gets much sharper at f4 at f4 the canon 24 104 is still definitely sharper but gets only slightly sharper at f5 6 while the tamron gets significantly sharper almost matching the canon l lens at f8 the tamron equals maybe a tad better the canon sharpness my copy of the 17 85 is strongest at the long end at 75mm f5 6 it matches the tamron sharpness and contrast but does not improve as much by f8 where the tamron sharpness pulls away n noverall the tamron appears to be an outstanding lens for either full frame or cropped frame if you do n t need wide angle it does not have is but does have a usable and fast f2 8 at the wide end it becomes very sharp by f4 for 28mm by f5 6 for 50mm and by f8 for 75mm n ni suspect that the tamron is similar or better in performance to the canon 24 70 l which weighs twice as much and costs 3 times as much the tamron matches the 24 105 across a full frame when both are stopped down a little the tamron is about the same size as the canon 17 85mm lens costs about 200 less but seems to have superior optical qualities especially at 28 50mm it also provides the f2 8 option for increasing shutter speed to freeze motion the 17 85 is much slower f4 to f5 6 but gets wider and slightly longer and has is for static scenes in low light it s a tough choice which depends on the camera and intended usage
14;37;11;0.7440447959175265;i purchased this lens and rented the nikon 24 70 2 8 the nikon lens is a tad sharper but also costs about 1k more for the price of the lens this is a great value i have used this at sporting events and in my studio i ve ended up leaving it on my camera as my go to lens it has a great variety or focal length and the fstop is great
15;25;6;0.7353187122563614;i ve used a ton of different lenses and this one is the one that i like the most besides my friend s canon 24 70l lens the shorter lenses like the stocker 18 55 is n t very zoomable but does have a wide angle aspect the digital slrs with 1 6 or 1 3 crop factors benefit greatly from the 28 75mm lens for uses where ultra wide and telephoto is not required this is a very useable walk about lens the fast 2 8 aperature is very helpful n nfor the price you can get other canon or non canon consumer grade lenses that may have a bit more reach than the 75mm reach of this lens but they have either much slower lenses harder to take low light situations without a tripod or even with image stabilization that this one does n t have or the image quality is far less n nyou will be very surprised with the quality of this lens i have never been one to blindly buy a lens just because it is a canon lens even some of the l lenses are easily comparable to the off brand sigma or tamrons
16;40;4;0.6260046575266696;i wo n t go into a lot of details of this particular lens as previous reviewers in my opinion have hit the nail on the head this is my first third party lens after doing research for several months on the net reviews in looking for a new all around everyday carry lens i have enough canon glass which are very good but this particular tamron lens beats matches my canons in nearly every quality category plus this lens is lighter and costs much less yes this is a keeper
17;57;3;0.6068080404718837;when i bought my canon 20d recently i really needed to get a lens for mostly indoor shots i needed something that was affordable the cost of the 20d wiped me out and a continuous 2 8 i was hesitant to buy a non canon lens but this lens is fantastic n nit takes excellent pictures and it is so affordable i truly ca n t say enough good things about it i almost never take it off my camera

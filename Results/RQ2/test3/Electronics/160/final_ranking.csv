0;111;46;0.9196665727626985;i m a big fuss when it comes to sound quality and the requirements of my musical items in my spare time i write and record music and as a guitarist i spend lots of time around tube amplification and speakers so i generally know my way around sound i would n t go as far as to call myself an audiophile but i am the only one of my friends who gets annoyed by low bitrate tracks my daily driver headphones are a set of klipsch image s4 s and my home headphones are a pair of akg k242 hd s so i m referencing those with regards to sound quality here it goes n nbuild quality nthe overall feel of the satellites is pretty much what i expected they are plastic enclosures though the plastic is a nicer quality and the grilles are nicely made no fraying stitching showing etc the legs are made of metal and feel very sturdy though one of them the right satellite was n t sitting flush to my table which required me to bend the left leg a little not a big deal at all and it was mostly me being a stickler but i thought it was worth mentioning oh and it comes with a little baggie of rubber adhesive feet that you can apply to the bottom of the satellites so they do n t move and sit on a base that wo n t reverberate their sound through a desk these are an absolute pain i ruined two of them by pulling off the adhesive along with the sticker you really have to get your thumb in between it or else you ll ruin it be careful not a big deal though because they give you 12 when you only need 8 in total 4 for each satellite overall though the construction is solid wood satellites would ve been cool but at this price range that s asking a lot the sub is nicely built from what i can tell a nice finish with proper speaker wire for the satellites and not some proprietary connector a nice touch as it ll be easy to replace if need be and who knows maybe you can use different satellites though i would n t mess with it the only downside build wise is the lack of a power switch on the system that s right short of unplugging it you ca n t turn it off oh well apparently klipsch states that it was designed this way but knowing that many owners of these have had the amp in the unit fail it s still concerning though i wo n t make that an issue unless mine decided to eventually fail in which case i will edit this review n nsound quality nso here s where it matters honestly the looks of a system mean little to me if it sounds like garbage but like almost every klipsch product i ve encountered the sound quality is sublime for its price like my set of image s4 headphones these promedia speakers are the best sounding 2 1 multimedia speakers in the price range that they are the competing logitech z623 s while a solid system are blown away here while they are just as powerful at 200 watts they lack certain aspects of the klipsch set that makes them a less worthy system in my opinion i ll break down the klipsch set comparatively as follows n nhighs nthe high end range of these speakers is greatly enhanced over most other multimedia and 2 1 speaker systems in this range through the utilization of a 3 4 horn tweeter as well as the larger midrange driver in the satellite most systems such as the competing logitech z623 in this price range have satellites with only a midrange driver this addition on klipsch s end allows for more shimmering highs and a cleaner sound stage with a much more defined tonality n nmids nthe midrange on these speakers is excellent the high mids blend perfectly due to the addition of the tweeters which let the midrange speakers focus on what they need to the midrange and not try to compensate this allows a more airy and open soundstage for the satellites as a whole any lack of midrange bite that these may have is easily dialed out with proper eq ing on your pc n nlows nah the lows they re definitely there and while they may not be as powerful as the logitech system i found that they are more accurate and better accentuated if you re really just trying to find a system to do low end thump or you re just trying to blast your dubstep as hard as you can at a party this is n t your system do n t get me wrong there s quite the bass on tap and i crank dubstep on them occasionally but it s not going to be insane the knob for the subwoofer adjustment is also not as linear as i had hoped at least at normal listening levels for example if considering the knob as a scale from 1 to 10 the bass level when set at 10 is not double what it is at 5 the bass intensity seems to peak at roughly 1 o clock on the knob and everything after that seems to do less and less still that s more bass than i would want anyway and to be honest it begins to distort unfavorably but that s expected of any audio with it s parameters maxed i have my subwoofer control set at roughly 10 o clock i find this is more than ample the bass itself is very articulate as well i listen to a lot of metal and with many other systems quick double bass often turns itself into one muddled sound without differentiation in this regard the klipsch system is very good it s not perfect and it can get muddy with certain things but it s leaps and bounds better than the subs offered in comparable systems at this price the range on the sub is also very good bass notes in very low registers are n t lost though a move to an 8 sub would have made things even better still at this price who can complain n noverall soundstage nthe overall presence of these speakers is incredible there s a 3d depth to music listened through these that not many other systems have and music really tends to pop through them there s a much more organic presence in this set of speakers than many of the other i had looked at and listened to they re definitely the best in the price range with regards to accuracy they re also very low noise there s almost no hum from the speakers and no audible buzzing from idle when sound is not being played through them with that regard i was very impressed outside the realm of music things are wonderful though honestly not as great as with music watching film is a joy but the same articulate nature of the subwoofer gained from reduced output shows itself here while the aspects of the sub that make it good for music such as articulate rather than powerful bass can help it in film where they whirring of helicopter blades individual come through much better than on the more powerful and more muddy subwoofers of competitive speaker systems the lack of what seems to be sheer bass power hurts slightly rumbling explosions feel excellent but not overwhelmingly exhilarating like they do on the logitech z623 for example if you re looking for the biggest bass you can get regardless of accuracy or if you primarily watching film with these speakers you might be a little happier elsewhere but as far as a whole soundstage package goes taking into account movie and music listening you ca n t do any better than these for me i d much rather take bass accuracy than abundance quality over quantity is the name of the game with these speakers and they do n t disappoint in that regard n nsome issues nthe only issue i have with the subwoofer and in all honesty the system itself is it s inability to fill in the small gap that is the low mid frequency range there s a tiny albeit present acoustic gap in that frequency range which ever so slightly accentuates the disconnect between the satellites and the subwoofer what i mean by this is that occasionally the satellites sound separate from the subwoofer almost as if there is a missing part of the system that should be there to reproduce certain sounds in all honesty i ca n t fault the system for this this is an issue with all 2 1 multimedia sets a large sub and relatively small satellites in comparison generally causes something to be missing in this case a speaker in between the subwoofer s size and the satellite s midrange driver to take care of the frequency that said it s a very small range that would require a whole new speaker orientation and design to take care of so it s not a big deal it is n t there like i said it s just the nature of 2 1 systems in general but this is a sound review so i might as well mention it n nanother small issue that arose was some crackling in the midrange drivers of the satellites upon first using these speakers there was a faint yet audible buzzing of the drivers which to be honest upset me a bit it ruined the tonality of a lot of songs and it kind of distracted me from the music luckily though the more the speakers were broken in the more it faded and it s as far as i can tell now gone at least in normal listening conditions without isolating the speaker through eq ing and turning off the sub as of now though i m going to chalk it up to normal noise from speakers that are simply un played and need to be broken in but it s worth mentioning as a new unit may show these signs and might be alarming or annoying to first time listeners n nconclusions nthese are without a doubt the best 2 1 computer speakers you can buy their long track record proves that the addition of tweeters in the satellites is a wonderful boost to the liveliness of the soundstage and the focus on an accurate rather than boomy subwoofer is excellent for those who demand an accurate reproduction of their music rather than a colored soundscape of course these are n t going to beat a set of nice bookshelf speakers and they certainly are n t as accurate but for a 2 1 system at this price range you ca n t do any better in my book though there are questionable aspects of their long term reliability you ca n t even turn them off short of unplugging them which is even worse for the amp coupled with the fact that there are a good number of people complaining about the amp blowing out on theres mine work perfectly and show no signs that they might break down in the near future so taking points off for that reason would n t be fair can you get better sound of course can you get better sound at this price i really do n t know if you can other than going used and hunting down an amplifier and a pair of good bookshelf speakers but then you re missing the point 2 1 s are easy and simple solutions for those who do n t want to deal with amps large speaker enclosures and dedicated systems with that in mind the klipsch promedia 2 1 is at least to me your best bet at their price and they re certainly the best sounding 2 1 multimedia speakers i have had the pleasure of using
1;98;59;0.9185245855495875;i purchased this speaker system about 3 years ago and it has been a constant love hate relationship there are so many pro s and con s for these speakers i m not gon na go into all of them just the ones i considered to be most relevant in my uses nthe pro s include n amazing sound quality and range i love feeling the rumble and with this sub i rarely turned the tone knob above about a third for a movie and maybe halfway or so for some hard trance metal rock and even some older rap the mids were clean and clear so clear that i could hear someone coughing in a live recording of mannheim steamroller and the highs unreal you can put in some old big band jazz like maynard ferguson and there is almost no distortion to the screaming trumpet no matter if i was watching a movie via my laptop jamming to pandora through my phone or using an old sony walkman the sound was always superb n very strong design considering the made in china sticker i am amazed that i only just managed to destroy this system but in a way this was also a downfall in my opinion more on that in a minute n small footprint i originally purchased these to install int he sleeper of my kenworth w900l a semi notorious for having one of the smallest and tightest living quarters in the industry the component speakers are perfect for either hard mounting on a wall or using the permanently mounted feet if you use them on the desktop the foot design makes it easy to keep a tape or paperclip dispenser on them the sub also has a fairly small footprint and since it is ported and side facing there are very few limitations on where you can set it n on one of the satellites there are stereo jacks for both an extra audio input device and an output jack for headphones n volume and tone controls are very simple and very sensitive the included amplifier definitely does what it is intended for n nand the cons n as stated earlier this is built quite well so much so that if there is even a small problem you can not fix it but must replace the entire get up a lightning bolt fried my surge protector and managed to do damage to the power module of the amp because of this all three speakers are useless now the amp is coated with a layer of melted glues making it impossible to even remove a chip for any kind of inspection n the wiring is very poorly designed in many ways first you have to run the obvious power and speaker cables no problem right this system adds in another wire which in my opinion is the weak link of this whole package you must run an extra wire from the primary satellite speaker to the sub alongside the normal speaker wire this extra wire is the control tether for the volume and tone controls nothing more and when plugged in it pushes the sub enclosure a few inches out for fear of crimping the wires the jack for this wire is also very temperamental after a few days of use i would have to sit there and wiggle the wire to get the circuits to close n the power switch location sucks the toggle is located near the bottom back side of the sub this means that you need to be very nimble if you want to put the box out of sight the switch is also located right by the above noted temperamental wire so bumping it out of place when turning on the speakers can be more than a mild annoyance n nso with these things considered would i buy them again probably not this particular design while i absolutely love the sound quality i think that the wiring issue and the fact that you can not do any sort of upkeep is a really big fault i hate having 3 speakers here that all sound great but i ca n t use because of one little circuit board getting fried i hate having to go out and buy a whole new system because of this so for a home entertainment system in a house i plan on dieing in i would definitely consider installing a plethora of klipsch components and speakers but for anything less i doubt i will
2;86;39;0.8997768883775539;i was looking to replace a set of 20yr old 2 1 speakers that still sounded great but one speaker would stop working on occasion the speaker was not blown just a wire would have to be wiggled and played with to get it going again n nmusic movies and games all sounded great with my old speakers yet i was hoping for even better sound and had always considered klipsch a higher end line i found the klipsch on sale for 99 99 at a local store so i purchased them after reading many reviews both positive and negative n nfirst thing i noticed out of the box was that these things were extremely light especially the subwoofer i know with electronics and advancements that lightweight is not necessarily a bad thing but for speakers with magnets etc the promedia just felt off my old subwoofer is about one quarter the size yet weighs probably 10 times as much as the klipsch even the satellites weighed a lot more than the promedia ones n nthe construction on the klipsch looked okay but feels very cheap they are wood but poor quality wood the screens on the satellites also felt low end there is no on off switch on either the satellites or the subwoofer not a deal breaker to me since i leave mine on all the time but worth noting lastly the knobs on the satellite felt weak and had way too much play i use the volume mixer with my computer and with these i think you would have to unless you want to break it right off the speaker n nbeginning to feel a bit apprehensive i hooked up the new klipsch and kept my old set right next to them hooking up is fairly simple connect satellites to sub with red and black wires and connect the funky amp connection similar to a ps 2 mouse connector n nthe klipsch satellites sounded pretty good but the subwoofer had very little tight bass response i played a variety of music through them to get as full of a range as possible throughout every song the satellites performed well but the sub ruined it i was not expecting audiophile quality bass response but this thing rolled and flabbed along not tight and not clean if you want loud booming hanging bass you may be okay with it if you are looking for decent somewhat tight and clean response then this will disappoint n nflipping back and forth with the same songs through both the promedia and my ancient speakers the klipsch satellites were a bit better but the subwoofer could not make a scratch i paid about 75 for mine way back so i had hoped the promedia would have been at least on par after all i bought the klipsch to be an upgrade n nhaving read that new speakers sometimes take a little bit to be optimal i continued using both for a little over a week both were never turned off and kept on during this period the promedia never got any better the satellites were decent sounding but the sub was just ruining it n nthe promedia 2 1 set has been sold for about 10 years maybe five years ago these things were near the top but not now they may look the same and have the same name but the materials the construction and the quality appears to be quite different i have my doubts that the current promedia would last a year so i returned them n nif you are looking for a mid to high end speaker set then this is not it i am giving this product 1 star because while it sounds decent everything else about it leans heavily towards basic low end if they were between 50 and 70 dollars i would rate them higher however seeing as they are expensive and supposed to be mid high end they fall far short in my opinion klipsch should be embarrassed to have their name on this speaker set
3;93;146;0.8768656446481525;i am very happy with the klipsch promedia 2 1 i read as many reviews as i could before purchasing considering the gmx a 2 1 among others i really had klipsch in mind because of their track record and the raving reviews it definitely performs and has plenty of power much to spare i can not speak so much to the quality because i do not have a trained ear for intense listening all i can say is that it sounded way better than my old speakers computer show piece of junk i also own the logitech z 560 thx 4 1 system for my computer at school comparing the two it seems like the klipsch system has more power both have plenty to spare i assume that having a separate tweeter improves the quality of the highs but i could n t really hear a difference also the klipsch gives you more control over the subwoofer when i turn the subwoofer down on the klipsch it is very close to off when i turn the bass control down on the logitech the subwoofer is still booming the klipsch system is fairly easy to set up the lack of bare end wires the klipsch has a mini jack on the speaker end might turn some users off does n t really bother me the price of the system is a real hit to the checking account and i m not even sure it s worth it for more i could have purchased the z 560 s again alas no room for it and no 5 1 sound card for this this system will be overkill for most users but if you like big sound without distortion and you have some money to spend here is your system gamers should probably get a 5 1 system by klipsch promedia not gmx or logitech you can read plenty of technical reviews with fancy graphs and numbers and jargon like soundstage online they all proclaim the klipsch promedia 2 1 the standard by which every other 2 1 computer speaker system is measured design wise these are n t exactly sexy but not hideous or out of date either they are quite large larger than the logitech sattelites i recommend these speakers to the buyer not on a tight budget who listens to a lot of music i do n t recommend these speakers to gamers or buyers who want to watch dvds because of the lack of 5 1 just for the heck of it i ve also seen heard a klipsch promedia 5 1 setup probably playing stereo mode broadcast to an entire street block it was n t anythign close to a concert but if it s enough to travel that far with clarity it s certainly enough to fill up a room
4;129;63;0.8680166276845024;anyone who rates these klipsch pro media 2 1 speakers high likely has not had them for very long n nthe good for the purpose of being computer speakers these were initially what i thought was one of the best purchases i d ever made out of the box and freshly connected i was blown away with the sound quality and grinned from ear to ear really could n t have been happier n nthe bad however after about 5 months issues started to develop with the quality at first i noticed a crackling shorting out sound from the satellites whenever i adjusted the volume this progressively got worse over the next few weeks then intermittenly one of the satellites would have no sound i found that i could remedy this by jiggling the din connector at the back of the subwoofer n nthis scenario got worse also leading to a month or so where i could only get sound by finding a perfect spot where the connection seemed to not short out this was always accompanied with loud crackle sounds and pops eventually i could only get the system to work if the cord was propped with an object to maintain that perfect spot n nthe ugly finally even all that manipulation would no longer work and the system was rendered completely dead after about 7 8 months now if you have the cash flow that enables you to blow a hundred dollars or more every 6 9 months on a pair of these in order to get the wonderful sound they do create then go ahead and knock yourself out if you are fine with that enjoy because i will not deny that they do have impressive sound my bad was disconnecting these hooking up a cheaper not nearly as good sounding but ever reliable set of logitech speakers in the interim and forgetting about the klipschs until the warranty had just expired i called customer service and was told i could send them in and have them repaired for about seventy five dollars plus shipping yeah right and have the same thing happen and it would guaranteed all over again no way i do n t think i want to be that stupid n nif you read others ratings you will notice a recurring theme with these klipschs great sound quality very inferior design and component quality i simply add mine to the list as a precaution to save frustration and the lightening of your wallet the only thing i would hope is that they would ve made some design and quality control changes in the two years or so since i bought mine but do n t hold your breath
5;8;100;0.8600464548673995;i purchased the klipsch promedia 2 1 thx solution last week after reading the reviews here for the most part the reviews are accurate n nshort version these computer speakers are definitely worth the price i paid about 150 locally at best buy n nlonger version the primary use for the speakers is for music mostly mp3 high 320 bitrate cd quality rips there is the occasional cd and game but mostly the mp3 library i listen to mp3s from literally every genre there is including oldies country jazz classical and rap hip hop but the majority of listening is metal hard rock and classic rock n nwanting to step up from my budget harmon kardon 3 speaker system i considered this klipsch solution as well as the bose companion 3 and 5 due to the usb only option on the bose companion 5 it was quickly ruled out n nhaving the search narrowed between the klipsch promedia 150 and the bose companion 3 250 i headed off to best buy knowing they sold both and had them in stock as luck would have it they were set up for demos side by side i first listened to the klipsch then the bose then repeated both my wife and myself were both immediately convinced that the klipch offered a much fuller and richer sound the bose had little midrange and was to tinny sounding the choice was obvious and the klipsch was 100 less n nbrought them home and set them up immediately definite quality look and feel to the speakers subwoofer amp and even cabling documentation is minimalistic but setup is not that difficult for the general user n nthe system sounded very good upon initial trial i played parts of 10 20 mp3s of varying genres all at very high volume if you max out the volume there is some distortion despite what some others have said but in most situations i find it unlikely that anyone would max out the volume on this system they are designed for the listener to be located a few feet away in front of the speakers not for a whole house sound system n nthe sound range is excellent on these speakers the design is well though out the product is definitely worth the 150 and certainly on par or better than the bose offering the bose does look better but are you buying speakers for visual or sound n nbased upon my initial impression and assuming these speakers hold up well over the expected life span i would definitely recommend them and would buy them again myself for another computer if needed
6;51;67;0.8536882798483888;i bought these 2 1 speakers a little more than 2 years ago to replace a 4 1 set of klipsch speakers that the front speakers stopped working i never opened the subwoofer to see what burnt and purchased the 2 1 version the 2 1 speakers are hooked up to a computer used for ripping and sharing music with my media computers around the house since i have a media computer on every tv in the house i really do n t use the computer with the klipsch speakers anymore and leave them powered off i started up the speakers this week because i needed to rip and add some new music to the shared music folder and heard a high pitched sound from my left speaker than a pop coming from the subwoofer i opened up the subwoofer and noticed one of the boards i am guessing the amplifier for the left speaker was burnt i also notice the power supply spacer was not even insert onto the bolt before tighting the worst part of this is the left speaker midrange driver is also burnt n nthis is the last set of klipsch promedia speakers for me i will not buy anything with a amp in it made by klipsch again for my ht i have a rf 83 home theater system without klipsch subwoofer and will never buy a klipsch subwoofer to go with it n ni have a definitive subwoofer that i will be replacing in the living room thats never shutoff and still works like it did over 10 years ago i think i will buy another definitive subwoofer n ni do admit the promedia speakers sounded great when they worked but the quality of the amps are junk i do not recommend buying these speakers unless you think 2 years life is good enough for the money spent
7;61;25;0.8231385276681144;klipsch promedia 2 1 vs logitech z623 n nthis review is for all the folks who are deciding between buying the logitech z623 and klipsch promedia 2 1 for a well rounded 2 1 audio system with the best bang for the buck i was literally torn between the two systems based on my inability to compare both of them side by side in any store neither bestbuy frys hh greg nor any other major electronics store had these two at the same time to get a decent comparison also it is nearly impossible to really understand how these would sound in a store environment where there is a lot on ambient noise open space and lack of an acoustic room so i decided to purchase these two try these at home and then return whichever i found lacking in certain aspects n nbased on my evaluation i decided to keep the logitech z623 n ni evaluated the systems using several music tracks which included classical pop rock trance and hip hop and played them simultaneously on both the systems at same decibel levels in increments apart from this i also played certain movie scenes which were bass heavy for low frequency range treble heavy high frequency and also scenes having dialogues for mid range evaluation i am not a gamer and so did not evaluate the sound for this n nmids and highs the satellites on the klipsch feature a mid range driver and a tweeter i thought this would provide a crisper sound especially in the high frequencies this might be true in certain instances however where i felt the klipsch fell short were in the sound integration of the two drivers depending on your ear level there seemed to be a sweet spot where these provided more clarity in overall sound over the z623 however if you moved around or up down either of the driver seemed to overpower the other so for instance if i were kneeling in a direct ear level line with the mid driver the mid range frequencies seemed to be more prominent and if i were to stand up the tweeter seemed to overpower the mid this is a huge downfall in my eyes the sound coming from the tweeter and mids should be well balanced blended in seamlessly it should feel like both the drivers work together to provide a perfect acoustical blend period this was not the case with the klipsch the z623 seemed to have a much better balanced sound coming from the satellites given that they have only a single full range driver the sound also seems to envelope the listener much better than the klipschs although i would have preferred a slightly sharper sound from the z623 on the highs n nbass the z623 sub produced a well balanced bass surprisingly upon doing a bass test the z623 had audible bass upto 20hz the klipsch sub pretty much went inaudible at 35hz the bass on the z623 will actually rattle the hell out of windows and any other loosely secured items in the room however the bass from the z623 lacked the thump feel where i would i have expected it to be and this is where the klipsch scored over the z623 the bass on the klipsch is more boomier than the z623 however this is only true until about 1 3rd the level on the bass knob beyond that the klipsch bass starts distorting and sounding purely bad it lacks the fidelity at higher volumes at about 2 3rd volume the klipsch driver actually starts making internal thud noise which completely messes up any audio n nthe z623 holds up very well even at full bass levels the bass sounds more distributed and does not cause any of the above issues nadditionally the z623 also has a lot more input ports looks more aesthetically pleasing and is actually cheaper than the klipsch i also read a lot of review with the klipsch having quality issues and the speakers failing after a few months or years n nindependently both the systems sound great however on a head to head comparison i would definitely choose the logitech z623
8;29;26;0.8167693297665725;i purchased these to replace my old promedia i bought back in 2008 because the subwoofer started rattling and sounded distorted i noticed the new subwoofer did not have a power switch and a fuse on the back like the old one did also the new subwoofer was lighter than the old one n nafter i hooked them up and played music through them it sounded nothing like my old promedia did the old one sounded fantastic almost as good as my 3 1 home theatre speakers the new ones sounded flat and lifeless in comparison if you were to put the old ones in one room and the new ones in another room you would definitely hear the difference in sound quality like the difference between night and day how could that be i wondered did i get a bad set n nthen i read that klipsch redesigned the subwoofer that used to contain a discrete power amp with separate output transistors and power supplies and changed it to a chip amp no wonder the difference in sound i returned them the next day i m now looking into buying the promedia 2 1 wireless the subwoofer looks like the old design with the power switch and fuse on the back hopefully it will sound as good as my old promedia and will spare me the aggravation of repacking returning them and waiting for a refund n nthis is a trend i m seeing more and more of these days manufacturers take a product that is perfectly good and start tinkering with it and redesigning it and end up screwing it all up
9;27;20;0.7929528640626236;these are hands down the best pc speakers i have ever owned i exclusively have used mid to high end klipsch speakers for my home theater that s 5 1 all klipsch since those first set of 5 1 klipsch speakers i bought over 10 years ago to my newest ones i was in love with the clarity and ability for them to hit the high and lows so accurately and also output good clean bass for perfect sound now the home theater features a denon x4000 receiver feeding those klipsch speakers but these klipsch promedia 2 1 speakers are nothing short of spectacular for about 2 hours i have been listening to some music from a few linkin park nine inchs nails and some kinda softer stuff songs and it s like i m hearing them for the first time they are pretty much the same quality as my home theater if it were 2 1 i m serious these sound that good i got mine as an open box item on an auction site and they look brand new and hookup was simple my asrock motherboard features a realtek alc898 7 1 ch hd audio codec which is pretty darn good but anyway you look at it if you want speakers you can play loud and also have a lot of base with perfect clarity these are worth the investment my old m audio studio pc speakers no sub though connected to a dedicated creative sound blaster x fi titanium hd sound card using rca jacks to the card and it sounded no where as good as these promedia s do that sound card and those m audio sounded good though just nothing like the promedia 2 1 do with my on board sound trust me you wo n t regret these if your looking something that sounds amazing on a pc plus for the price is as low as it for something of this high quality it s hard to find great speakers in the pc category anyway buy these and you will rediscover your music and movies as well n nupdate 9 13 2015 n nthese speakers are flat out incredible after a full day using them i am just blown away at the quality of the sound and how loud they can get
10;53;22;0.7664733547716959;i bought a set of these for one workstation and liked them so much i purchased a second set for another computer they are well built good sounding computer speakers but do n t confuse them with actual high end music reproduction transducers for they are not that klipsch was a well known name in the early days of stereo and concert hall speaker systems had a bad period ok bad decade where they made a lot of junk and now seem to be enjoying something of a renaissance by producing things that do n t sound too bad at all n nthe subwoofer can easily overpower the much smaller mid high speakers so most of us normal people will never need to turn it up beyond 1 or 2 unless you re into a physically percussive experience that may damage retinas or other organs the construction is high quality there s no skimping on cable length and the speaker stands are heavy but bendable steel making it easy to aim them properly while still remaining quite stable i put flat rubber feet on the bottom of mine so they would n t slide around they do not seem to cause interference with any other device eg picture quality on monitors and no other device seems to interfere with them or cause problems eg noise or crackling n ni m deducting a few points for the weird din plug used to connect everything if that breaks or you bend a pin the whole system is kaput also in the arena of minor annoyances is that the led power light is very bright and annoying if it happens to be right front of you like say anytime you re listening to something there is no power on off switch the provided stands are about 7 deep and 4 wide and it appears they can be removed perhaps for wall mounting they are matte black and are likely to be quite unobtrusive in most settings except for that obnoxious led power light n noverall very happy with these for general viewing listening purposes
11;95;31;0.7661626873773406;i ve been a hard core klipsch fan since the 70 s but i had reservations about ordering these due to the low price for anything klipsch my fears were settled completely as soon as i hooked them to my computer whoa i ve heard some high end bose systems that i was impressed with expensive but these babies blow them away the highs are super smooth and sweet and there s nothing thin sounding about them very unlike the traditional klipsch horn type speakers that audiophiles either love or hate as i said sweet smooth and rich the sub is equally as good the bottom end is super tight and clear and i can pick out every single bass note without excessive volume nothing muddy about it at all operation is simple turn up the speakers or the sub individually i thought i would at least have to play with the eq on my computer but nope the speakers and sub just enhanced the settings i already have i think i paid 179 for these babies and i consider that the best deal i ve gotten in a very long time i ca n t sing the praises of these speakers enough
12;72;16;0.754635675927299;these are amazing speakers after hearing them i immediately understood why they re recommended as the high standard in 2 1 desktop speaker systems n nmy previous speaker setup was a logitech 5 1 system it was great but re purposed in a media room and i was getting a little tired of having a big 5 1 system on my desktop i prefer a minimal approach these klipsch speakers were immediately recommended and i m very happy with them n nthey re obviously less clunky and more suited to a desktop than the 5 1 system i had but there are a few other reasons why i prefer these over the logitech s i had n nfirst the quality and value difference is immediately apparent for example the satellite speakers come with sturdy metal stands not cheap breakable plastic like the logitech s trust me i know i had a logitech stand break they re also noticeably heavier in general and do n t shift on their own or while inadvertently making contact with other objects being moved around on my desk top you also get tweeters on the satellite which are an omission on the logitech s n nsecond the volume and sub controls are on one of the satellite speakers which makes adjustments very easy the logitech s actually had a separate device to control volume and sub which contributed to even more wire and desk top clutter n nthird the sound quality is amazing these things sound noticeably more clear especially in the highs than the logitech s the sub still provides plenty of low end but the satellites really shine due to the included tweeters these klipsh just sound more clear and articulate compared to the logitech s n noverall i m glad i paid the extra money for these should they ever go out i ll immediately order another set
13;4;24;0.7541563506061862;edit i m updating this to 5 stars the innards are cheaper and lighter but still very adequate and the whole package still sounds absolutely excellent i think bass extension is slightly improved in the lowest registers over the original but that s a very subjective thing that i m not prepared to argue these are just lovely lovely musical speakers to listen to n edit n nthis is a placeholder review to enable me to upload some comparison photos of the original version of the amplifier module these speakers used to ship with versus the new version n nthe original speakers were absolutely excellent and gave a full decade of fairly hard daily use before the neoprene bellows on the subwoofer s driver speaker failed it remains to be seen how long the new version will last and indeed how they sound they ve obviously moved to a class d amp for the sub at least which concerns me mightily n nsome hard numbers on the original versus the new original amp module weights 3280 grams and is attached to a 1 thick steel backing plate the new amp module weighs 820 grams and is attached to a 05 thick steel backing plate n ni will update this review if i find anything specific good or bad to say about the audio quality in comparison to the original version
14;64;17;0.6952417416211074;i originally had a 4 5 review when i first got these speakers because they were just slightly tinny but otherwise seemed fine two days later one of the subwoofer channels just stops i ve tested both satellite speakers on the other working channel and the speakers work fine but the channel just wo n t work these speakers did n t move at all during this time just stayed on my desk after checking online it seems klipsch is notorious for having fuses blow all the time in the channels i used to have an older pair of klipsch that also blew fuses and i just thought they were a fluke and have n t used them in years but this is now years later and fuses are still blowing in standard day to day use n nthis is unacceptable and i will never be buying a pair of kilpsch speakers again i strongly recommend anyone considering these speakers to go elsewhere
15;45;14;0.6798502197591084;after moving and having my harmon kardon soundsticks ii damaged i decided to see what else i could get for around the same price n n having a home theater setup with klipsch i decided to try them out for my computer hands down the best computer speakers for the price i have ever used sound quality blows away the soundsticks which i thought were impressive for computer speakers these bring a new level of power and crispness which the sound sticks lose as the volume is increased the sub also provides a great amount of bass without the issue of plastic rattling found in the soundsticks with age or increased bass
16;39;19;0.6244852120229394;bought this sound system because of the great reviews sounded great the first day i bought it then i realized there was a clicking static noise coming from the satellite speakers this was on the 2nd day owning these speakers i looked online and apparently this happens all the time with these speakers which is quite unfortunate after about a week of owning these speakers i m a bit disappointed
17;55;10;0.41628797414085067;i expected good sound what i got was great sound the sound is crisp and clear and has great punch the subwoofer will literally shake the house i was not expecting such a huge sound from such a small package i am very impressed

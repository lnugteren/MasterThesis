0;19;16;0.6505870001060878;i ve purchased several belkin cables and they always seem to be well made only problem with this particular cable is that it is not usb 2 0 which i did n t realize when i bought it i had intended to attach it to another cable which i purchased at the same time according to the instructions it is not advisable n nthe mistake was completely mine i just did n t think to check for usb 2 0 when i purchased it
1;11;23;0.647155151373607;with this kind of product it just come down to if it works or it does n t unlike speaker or video cables the quality of shielding or core material does not really make the differences nthere are standard for usb 1 1 and usb 2 0 if the cable was manufactured to meet those standard it works if it did n t well it wo n t work nthis product works well with all my needs but if you are looking for cables for usb 2 0 products look else where usb 2 0 requires much higher quality cable
2;8;20;0.6104645488088962;if you re looking for a basic 10 usb extension cable you ve come to the right place belkin s products have always been reliable and this one is no different n nthe belkin f3u134 10 is a 20 gauge 10 usb cable a plug to a receptacle i use mine on an older pc that only has usb ports on the back of its tower thanks to this cable i no longer need to climb under furniture to insert my usb memory key n nif you plan to use this cable to extend a shorter cable be aware of recommended usb cable length limits low density devices e g mice and keyboards should not exceed cable lengths of 10 while high density usb devices such as scanners and printers should be limited to a total cable length of 16 feet if you plan to extend your current usb cable beyond these limits consider getting a repeating cable such as the belkin active extension usb cable n nperhaps the best reason to buy this usb cable from amazon is to get their hefty discount on belkin products you ll pay about a third what you would at your local electronics store now that s a bargain

4;12;15;0.5526452114777589;be forewarned this cable belkin 6ft f3u134 06 is not a usb 2 0 cable i m looking at the package that amazon shipped to me it clearly states 12 mbps transfer speed not the 480 mbps of a usb 2 0 i m sending this falsely advertised junk back
5;17;13;0.5402575234805934;i purchased this as an extension form my imac s keyboard since the attached cable is way too short i hooked it up and nothing neither the keyboard or the mouse would function i know it s only usb 1 1 speeds but that should n t be a problem for a keyboard mouse combo so if you re looking to pick one of these up make sure it s compatible with the hardware you are using
6;9;19;0.5370536220008248;this item does not specify the version of usb which support and it only support usb 1 1 specificacion so if you are looking for a cable which is capable of transmiting at usb 2 0 speed well this is not the cable
7;6;7;0.30742913845187914;just ordered three of these cables their appearance is slightly different than the belkin product and there is no labeling or package tried all 3 on two different pcs they get a usb device is not recognized message i have to assume these are knock off products beware
8;4;8;0.30713549289992137;i am usually very details aware but i also did not realize that this was old school usb 1 and not usb 2 capable

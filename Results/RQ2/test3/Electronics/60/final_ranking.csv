0;39;19;0.806216756706347;let s go back about two years ago i was a junior in college and i had some extra spending money in my pocket i pondered on what new and exciting toy i should add to my collection for months luckily i did not jump on any big investment right away and let myself research new products coming out i was playing with a couple of my girlfriend s cameras no i did not have multiple girlfriends at once just multiple friends who are girls at the time which is the reason i got into photography at the time the canon t2i was not even released yet but that managed to jump its way right to the top of the list of things to buy n nlong story short i end up buying myself a brand new canon t2i with the f 3 5 5 6 18 55mm kit lens i had a blast with it for the first few weeks and months until i began to grow into the camera and lens which i felt was beginning to limit my abilities i began researching more online about lenses and what direction i could go forth immediately i wanted the canon f 2 8 70 200 and i began saving for it realizing that it would take me summer after summer after summer to save up for one lens i ditched the idea i was still in the let s go out and get drunk every night mindset so money was hard to save and come by n nafter i managed to save about 300 i did some more research this time finding the canon f 4 5 6 75 300mm walking through best buy one day i saw that they had the lens on display and i had to have it even though i had seen the lens advertised at prices well below 200 i bought it anyway as soon as i got home i ripped open the box to reveal the contents inside a few canon pamphlets a canon warranty card 2 lens caps for front and back i was slightly disappointed to find no lens hood but for 200 i was n t expecting much anyway n nmy first impression of the lens was that it was pretty heavy and mainly plastic the only visible metal is when the camera is not attached to the camera the lens to camera connector is metal attached to my t2i the entire camera had to weigh about 3 5 pounds it felt like a 80 weight increase over the kit 18 55mm although it was heavy it felt sturdy it felt like if i were to bump into something it would not have broken unlike the kit lens which i babied because it felt so cheaply made n npros n huge focal range n 75 300mm essentially becomes a lens with the focal lengths of 120 480mm on a canon cropped sensor i m sure no one in their right mind has ever gone and bought a full sensor canon dslr and wanted to actually pair this lens with it n gives beginners a whole new set of tools to work with n can effectively be used as a cheap macro lens n cheap n ncons n heavy n slow aperture n slow focus n all plastic except for mount n noticeable halos around objects on the farther and closest end of the focal range chromatic aberration n nall in all this lens will work for any beginner looking to upgrade and gain a greater focal range i ran about 10 000 shots through this lens from sports to night time star shots to macros to landscapes to portraits it will do it all honestly looking back now i would have given this lens a 5 star review when i first got it now that i have seen and used some much nicer glass i ca n t give it anything more than a 3 yet it is not a 4 so it will stand on amazon as a 3
1;6;32;0.8020854507037679;i see a lot of bad reviews on this lens i honestly ca n t see why if i can capture a squirrel in tall grass 50 feet away hand held overcast and in the resulting image i can count the hairs on the squirrels face the hairs are sub pixel sized in other words the lens out performed the sensor there is n t any thing wrong with the lens the auto focus selected the subject of the image not the grass and quickly focused it even at full zoom the aperture was sufficient to shoot hand held at iso400 under cloudy skies so it s not image stabilized boo hoo it also does n t cost as much as a stabilized lens you can buy a pretty nice tripod for the price difference between this lens and a stabilized one can you get better glass for less maybe you can also spend a lot more money and not do better so unless you are a pro shooting in fast paced environments this lens will do fine if you are a pro why are you looking at an entry level lens n nsomething else to consider is that the usm is version of this lens is really the same glass in a fancier can and three times the price if you want the bells and whistles go for it the best value is here in the cheap seats
2;22;23;0.7930253199979239;my husband bought this to expand a canon t1i dslr that just had the kit lens no it does n t have is 400 bucks for a canon 250mm no it s not a l lens 1 500 bucks but for the price and the expandability it offers it was a good purchase i kills me to see people pay 150 bucks for a lens then bash it because it is n t a 1 500 dollar lens we would all love to have one of those this is a good lens for what it is a manual focus on distant objects lens one way to get around the hunting on auto focus is to put the camera on spot metering and if you want even quicker shooting just flick the camera to auto let it do the work this allows the camera to pinpoint the focus on a single spot it actually stays on the camera 80 of the time with the lower 75mm rating on zoom it s just a little closer than the 55mm kit lenses but with the quick ability to go to 300mm one of the reasons i chose the canon was the ability to use older ef lenses thus saving money and expanding as i go i still feel it was a great purchase and do n t regret it at all
3;54;34;0.7847612880698973;i purchased this lens a few days ago and have taken many action shots of birds and airplanes already and am very please i was concerned by some of the reviews complaining about the lens being slow to focus i did not find this to be a problem however it does on occasion decide to run the focus all the way one direction and then come back to the proper point n nsome people complained that it randomly decided what to focus on to those people i say read your camera s manual there is an option to select what point in your view your camera s auto focus will focus on and this is not a flaw of the lens n n when i left my canon rebel xs in full automatic mode it decides on the point put it in a more manual mode pick the point you want it to focus on and it works fine see page 102 of the canon eos manual n nbottom line if you are stepping up from a point and shoot or do n t want to spend 500 2000 on a lens this is a great buy
4;46;29;0.7712706523637061;i initially bought this lens in a package six months ago from the date of this review with my canon xsi along with the ef s 18 55mm kit lens i must say that this is a great lens and i have used it very often possibly more than my kit lens being one of the cheapest telephoto lenses in canons lineup not too much can be expected from the lens but it does deliver many things n nas far as image quality while it can be improved it still takes great pictures i use it for taking pictures of outdoor sports and it has come out with some great pictures using the lens indoors can be a challenge because it is a slow lens i always carry a tripod around as you will have to slow down your shutter speed to get your pictures correctly exposed before purchasing the canon ef 50mm f 1 8 ii i also tried using this lens for some portraits and was impressed with the results while it may not have the sharp detail as some other lenses it can still take some great pictures n nas for build quality it is light and plastic the front lens element does rotate while it focuses its autofocus motor is not usm so it is neither fast nor quiet but it does work well and seems quite accurate n nsometimes our budget restricts what we can buy and what we can use in my case i bought this lens because it fit my budget and have not regretted that purchase at all while this lens may not have the amazing image quality and build of other lenses it is important to remember that it is your photographic vision and drive that creates pictures even a great photographer with a toy camera can take a great picture do n t be discouraged by others who say this lens is not worth the money buy the equipment that fits your budget work with it good luck and have fun with your camera
5;9;15;0.7352414120668117;bottom line up front a very good if underrated telephoto zoom lens highly recommended for beginner to intermediate photographers best choice for the second lens you purchase n nthe canon ef 75 300mm f 4 5 6 iii usm should be a strong contender for the second lens you own for your canon dslr camera your first lens was probably a kit lens typically a standard zoom lens that has a range starting around 20mm and goes to around 80mm give or take a bit you ve enjoyed that lens but you re looking for something else something with more distance something you can really zoom in to see the action you want a telephoto lens you re also probably wanting a wide angle zoom lens something that will pull in that grand vista in front of you that s a different review but also a good choice for a second or third lens n nso you start looking at all the different lenses out there trying to find the best one for your money so you can take those photos you ve been dreaming of taking but it gets confusing so many numbers you re just starting out and you re wanting to make art not do math problems and so many different opinions what is best n nso here s my two cents it s biased like everyone else s opinions here but i ll try to tell you what i m thinking and why n nfirst pick a lens that goes with your camera if you own a canon camera in the long run you ll be happier with canon lenses i ve owned a few other brands for my canon cameras but they ve sometimes disappointed me canon lenses usually do n t there are several reasons for this but the most practical is that your camera is a system the canon camera talks electronically to the canon lens and the canon flash best so if you re using any automatic settings you ll get the best results using canon products you can get just as good of photos using different lenses and different flashes but you have to do all the work of communicating with the system by using manual settings not a problem if you know what you re doing but if you re new you ll want to use canon products to help with the workload and learning curve even if you re experienced it just makes everything significantly easier so i m biased there but you at least know where i m coming from my wife calls it lazy i prefer to call it efficient n nnext you need to think about what you want to do with the lens since you re looking at this lens you re probably thinking you want something that will give you the ability to take photos of things far away or at least make something that looks small look a lot bigger in your photo a telephoto lens will do this for me at least this was the perfect second lens option getting futher away from things usually was easier than getting closer especially with wildlife so what kind of telephoto do you need for most folks starting out a zoom telephoto as opposed to a prime focus telephoto is a better option it allows you to zoom in and out and better frame the photo you ll take so you ll be looking for a lens that shows a range of focal lengths say picking some random numbers 75mm 300mm the trade off is that you ll have larger focal ratio f stop f number it s called lots of things which means you ll need longer shutter speeds but that s going to hold true for all zooms image stablization will help with that some but in practice if you re using bright light like sunlight i have n t found it makes that much difference and it costs significantly more n nso that brings us to this lens it s an inexpensive telephoto zoom lens compared to other lenses out there it s no frills and does the job it s also more light weight than most telephoto zoom lenses out there which helps when you re holding the lens and camera by hand remember higher focal ratios mean longer shutter speeds meaning you have to be more steady for longer yes there are better telephoto lenses out there but you ll pay more for them and the big secret you ll not get that much better photos do n t get me wrong i have some l lenses as well and they re wonderful but i do n t necessarily get better photos from them i ve had the canon ef 75 300mm f 4 5 6 iii usm lens for almost 20 years and i ve taken some amazing photos with this lens why because i take a lot of photos so i have a lot of practice with it it also helps having steady hands although being a doctor and an expert military marksman means i have some practice there and or a tripod but really there is no substitue for practice that goes for any lens but if you re new to slr photography a good inexpensive lens like this to practice with will more than pay for itself n ntelephoto lens light weight inexpensive good quality you can ask for more but you ll pay for it this one does the trick and works well great to start with and the skills you ll develop will translate when if ever you upgrade
6;12;12;0.7322209826927772;i needed a zoom for those times when i needed to get close to something that was very far away like the other side of a valley or 3 blocks away or at the other side of the park etc n nin all these situations i knew i d most likely be outside in some kind of day light so as long as i m not shooting at night then i knew i d be just fine the aperture on this lens like any kit lens is not very compelling but for the price point and for my lousy budget this lens filled a need n ni have my 16mm 35mm and 50mm lenses all with f1 5 or f1 8 for serious video work even in low light situations so this lens made a nice addition for those other times when i just wished i could get in closer and had the light to do it n nso the actual mechanics and build of this lens plastic feels cheap like a toy auto focus is fidgety during tight zooms but that makes sense for any zoom lens really the good news again is the cheap price point n nso this lens is great for say a daytime sunrise sunset static shot which is going to be a lot of your shots so you get your money s worth i suppose i d never use this lens for serious detailed shots but hey at least i have it just in case
7;49;43;0.7245564168188234;i bought this lens used from adorama via amazon e for only 104 00 that s an n outstanding price and when adorama com says excellent condition n they mean it this lens was in new mint condition i ll buy my next lens n from adorama without a doubt i bought this lens to replace my 80 200 n zoom for i wanted greater range many reviews state that at the high end n this lens is n t quality i beg to differ i ve taken many photos at n the 300mm setting hand held and seen crisp clear and amazing results n for the price it s an outstanding lens the build quality is greater n than my former 80 200mm because it seems more solid and has a metal n mount ni give it a 4 out of 5 for sure it s not the usm so it s slower to n focus but i own other usm lenses and i ca n t tell a major difference n that s why i opted to try this lens out she s a keeper
8;11;17;0.6472752469105125;i am not a professional i am just a mom 99 of the photos i take are of my children before purchasing this lens i only had the kit lens and one prime lens i wanted a lens that would allow me to zoom in a bit so that i could snap photos of my children playing without having to be right up on them this is the perfect lens for that i shot my son s first little league game this past weekend while i was in the stands and he was in the outfield i got some of the most excellent shots showing his true emotions because he was n t posing he did n t see me right up on him taking photos i ca n t afford a 1 000 2 000 lens so this was the perfect price and i have gotten tons of compliments on the shots i even shot most of them on manual using the sports setting i have a canon rebel a lot of them were taken through a little hole in the fence
9;17;7;0.6152534959436415;i m using this lens with a canon eos elan iie camera and have been thrilled with the results my pictures are all clear and look like i was up close it is very easy to use and is the lens that lives on my camera
10;19;8;0.4765456873229696;this lens has worked out great for me i totally recommend it the canon camera is really something just about all of my pictures come out great it is really hard to take a bad picture with this equipment

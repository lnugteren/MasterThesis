0;2;58;0.8865683579704323;i purchased a midland 75 822 cb first and then a cobra 75wst about 5 months later they are both designed with most if not all of the electronics built into the handset type of cbs i wanted to use an external speaker with the handheld cb for better sound clarity the cobra s external speaker jack is in a more covenant out of the way location with possibly easier to operate with one hand controls than the midland cb on the cobra the remote speaker plugs into the remote adapter and not directly into the handset as the midland unit must this eliminates that extra in the way wire running from the midland handset to the external speaker and places the extra wire out of the way connecting it directly to the remote adapter of the cobra not to the handset with an external speaker plugged into the midland cb its on off volume and squelch controls are even more difficult to access the cobra handset has a longer coiled cord that s nice but its handset is a little overly large but not unworkable n nthe cobra volume and squelch controls are more conveniently located but do n t have any mid range markings this makes it hard to see where your settings are until something comes in too low to hear or screeches out too loud they are also a little hard to reach and work with with your thumb especially with the on off volume control which is a little hard and stiff to switch off the midland s controls are on top and kind of a two handed operation neither manufacture s design is a clear winner while driving a vehicle but maybe the cobra is a touch ahead here for one handed use by the way when i purchase hand gloves they are the extra large size n nthe sound tracker system appears to work but maybe a bit of a scam from my informal tests when you turn the sound tracker on the signal is noticeably quieter but the midland is always just as quiet in my comparison tests and nothing to switch on n neach time when you turn your cobra unit on to listen or talk you have to remember to push a button to activate the sound tracker and if you disconnect the 12 volt power all the cb s settings are instantly lost the midland cb retains its settings if it s turned off and also as long as the 12 v is connected plus even for a period of time even if the 12 v supply is disconnected n nthe weather band stations in my area seemed to come in better on the midland but not much better i will call this a near tie n nneither cb radio is a clear winner in my mind i think if i were purchasing cbs again it would be the midland 75 822 because midland also offers so much more with their cb than the cobra the midland unit comes with a bonus of two different battery packs one for regular batteries and a second one for rechargeable batteries plus a rubber ducky cb antenna that makes the midland fully portable allowing you to use it away from your vehicle not requiring the vehicle s 12 v supply and the vehicle s cb antenna sometimes midland also offers a power supply brick with their cb to charge the batteries it s not a very sophisticated charging unit it does not shut off or tell you when the rechargeable batteries are fully charged this leaves you to guess at the time and if they are fully charged a fast external charger would probably be a better option the cobra is missing most if not all of these features and from my internet searches the cobra cost more n nboth of my cb radios had electrical problems when first purchased the midland came new from an e bay purchase and i had to return it directly to midland for repair replacement as the display did not work when it got to around 45 degrees in temperature outside when the unit warmed up all was ok and in june july and august it took a while to notice the problem it was cheerfully replaced not repaired and they sent me back several more parts than i sent them the cobra unit received signals ok but would not transmit right out of the box i did not notice it right away as i assumed since the receiver worked ok and i was reusing an existing antenna all would be ok i had the option to return it to the seller or mail it in for i guess replacement just as midland s offered but the cobra cb came from amazon returning to amazon turned out to be a wonderfully simple and fast exchange process all my friends have been really impressed when i explained the exchange fortunately i returned the complete cobra cb not knowing amazon would cross ship me a complete and completely new unit with amazon paying all the shipping both directions as i remember it took just around a week maybe one or two days longer than the original delivery i guess they waited just long enough for them to determine my unit was in the mail and on its way back before they sent the replacement n nagain both cbs are very comparable with no clear winner in my mind but i think maybe midland has the edge but not enough for me to return my cobra and order a midland by the way i have no ties to any of the companies in this review n nthis is from my best memory i hope this helps in your cb radio decision n ndennis
1;51;28;0.8803403367040106;works great as a cb radio and noaa weather radio in the car mine s squeezed into the double din stereo slot in the dash of an accord along with an aftermarket head unit stereo i was able to screw the factory side mounting brackets into both the head unit and the cb radio to hold them together and then i just slid the whole thing back into the slot there is an almost unnoticeable gap on either side of the cb radio that does n t concern me in the slightest n ni connected the power wires constant power and ignition into the harness for the head unit and grounded the cb radio to the head unit n ni m using it in conjunction with a little wil 36 magnetic mount antenna very well reviewed smaller antenna and it performs wonderfully a good antenna will make or break this and any other cb radio i had it hooked up to an old un tuned 12 radio shack job and switching to a longer tuned antenna made all the difference i ran the antenna coaxial cable under some trim panels and then behind the stereo console to plug it into the cb radio if mounted in a stereo slot the antenna cable might just have enough room on one side or the other to squeeze out the front but running it from the back is probably the best idea not only for looks but so the antenna cable does n t get crushed or stripped cut on sharp metal dash parts n ndual watch and scan are nice features and sound tracker definitely seems to boost transmission as well as receiving though i do n t have a swr meter to test for sure n nthe mic seems a little plasticky cheap and bulky but works just fine n nno function for public address despite amazon s product description last line cb pa switch unless i m reading that wrong at any rate there s no output for a pa speaker and no switches indicators on the face of the cb radio for pa n nwhat i d change if i could n the led indicators for dual watch sound tracker and scan are directly underneath each corresponding button and installed in my honda accord underneath the already low positioned stereo head unit this causes the led indicators to be hidden by the buttons i ca n t see them without ducking my head n it s a little pricey for a cb with weather i guess you pay for the novelty of mounting it in a single din stereo slot i decided it was worth it when i bought it and i think i m sticking to that decision n it d be nice to have different color options especially since this unit is intended to be installed directly above or under a head unit which all seem to have different color options now led technology has come so far but it could just add price to an already fairly expensive radio n no dimmer it s a bit hard to read what channel you re on when in direct sunlight but fortunately it s not too bright at night to cause glare n nnone of these small inconveniences cause me to knock off any points from 5 stars it does what it s supposed to do very well and the convenient option of single din mounting to add function to a clean look is worth it to me n ni ll update this review if needed
2;19;11;0.8448733864095647;the cb radio is packed with a lot of great features in a box that does n t take up space on your dash or elsewhere in your vehicle where it might be in the way n nthe mic is larger heavier and unlike a traditional cb mic this all makes sense since the controls for the entire radio along with the speaker are all housed in this unit the buttons on the side for channels and ptt are more like what you find on a handheld cb radio n nthere are some nice features on this radio including the cobra soundtracker feature that removes static works well and weather bands channels 1 40 scan custom 2 channel scan and more i do wish it had a pa function n ninstallation of this radio itself was as easy as it gets in my 2014 jeep wranlger unlimited sahara i ve mounted the control box to a bracket behind my glove box i still have n t decided where to mount the mic but there are many aftermarket options if you do n t want to use the little clip that comes with the unit n nsome have complained about volume of the speaker when receiving transmissions my jeep is equipped with a soft top i have not as of yet had the top down since installing and can not speak to the volume levels while in an open air drive but with the top up the volume is perfectly loud enough for me to be able to hear the conversation loud and clear i had purchased an external speaker after reading reviews of low volume but as of yet have not needed to install it i plan to use it instead while we re sitting around camp and will run the speaker wire out the door to hear transmissions without needing the doors or windows left open n noverall i am happy with the unit and i think it will serve us well on trips and when traveling off road there are cheaper radios out there with the same features so where this unit shines is when you do not have a good mounting place for a standard cb radio control box
3;23;55;0.8413145402432262;being a member of a local miata club it is very common for our club runs to use cb s as the form of communication being in a miata also means there is not a lot of spare room for such things after talking to other members and reviews online i felt this would do everything i needed and then some the biggest asset is not having a large box that would need to be mountet and left in the car the second biggest reason i also chose this unit was i needed a cb for our cherokee 4x4 by being able to buy a second connection box for 25 i can use the main unit in two vehicles without the full expense of two cb s n nhookup is easy with a power ground and antanna connections the plug for the main unit to the connection box can be run from undernieth the dash or console or mounted in a hole with the supplied mounting plate and grommet i used a blank out panel unused switch location in the dash so if i ever remove it i can just replace this panel with no ill effects i drilled a hole in the panel the same size as the mounting plate and used the supplied grommet in this panel not using the mounting plate it is a very clean installation and when the handheld unit is removed you never know there was a cb in the vehicle n nthe biggest thing to remember for any cb is proper antanna tuning and a quality antanna without this it does n t matter how good the cb is how important is tuning i tuned my antanna for the best swr readings i could get which were very good and in our last club run i was the only person who could talk and receive from everyone in the group n ni am very happy with this product and am looking forward to getting it setup in our cherokee as well
4;57;30;0.8154231305379641;works fine i like all of the features that i ve tried i do n t need to monitor 2 frequencies at once so i do n t use the dual watch feature nor have i used the scan feature i love the soundtracker noise reduction system it has the ability to simultaneously reduce some background noises while amplifying the incoming signal the main reason i selected this radio was the immediate access to noaa i commute about 45 minutes one way in mostly rural areas and bad weather can come up quickly at the push of a button i can be informed of dangerous weather i like the channel 9 19 quick option but i doubt if anyone is monitoring 9 in my area but i wish that every time i turned the unit on it would n t be on 9 i have not used the external speaker but i ca n t figure out why cobra did n t add a p a output too a few more things this unit has 3 wires on it and they recommend wiring one to a fuse block my fuse block is under the hood i tied the red and orange wires together and ran them to a cigarette lighter plug the second thing is my cigarette plug has an led indicator light on it and when i leave the unit plugged in and off it runs my battery down i do n t believe it s the led doing it if anyone has any info or suggestions holler
5;13;15;0.7946110311615786;this radio is only good for the weather radio function and talking to someone within 100 yards if you are tired of yelling back and forth this is the third one of these radios i have owned i bought the first one used and it was a very poor performer i would only get about a block away transmission and then it would be very hard to understand there was basically no modulation i sold that jeep and i am sure that poor fella has ripped it out and thrown it off the nearest bridge the second was in a class a motor home and came installed from the factory and i always assumed it was a poor performer because i bought this rig used again this was sold with the vehicle why would anyone take the effort to take a turd sandwich out my third one of these i know what you are thinking three strikes you dumb butt i went to wallcot radio com and bought their recommended kit with the world famous bandi mount for my specific vehicle 2014 toyota fj cruiser i installed it and the antenna and this new radio performed as poorly i purchased locally a new wilson coax heavy duty mounting stud and a fire stick fire fly antenna grounded my mount scraped paint off the mounting location and still not any better scraped paint off i then bought a 102 in whip antenna and the 6 inch spring giving the best possible antenna selection my swr was between 1 3 and 2 no mater what antenna i used but my transmit was very poor i was on the interstate and the traffic stopped i was taking to a truck that was three truck lengths ahead of me he said i sounded like i was way out in the boonies and i was not getting any modulation once traffic started to move i could not talk to him as gained another 100 ft distance away ni called and talked to the wallcot radio people the very first thing i was told was my problem was my choice of radio and kit selection yea they recommend it and now n ni called cobra and went through the usual press 2 and wait and then talked to several people only to be told that my system was installed correctly and if i really believed this was inadequate for this radio i should send it in for warranty repair but they do not provide rma numbers n ni would not recommend this radio unless you really need a compact radio and then i think i would suggest a hand held cb instead or just yell out the window ni have many years experience installing mobile phones and antenna systems as well as car audio and alarms systems so i know how to install properly cobra confirmed my installation and trouble shooting practices were sound and wallcot radio confirmed that this selection of radio is a poor choice nthis is a novelty item and you should keep that in mind if you intend to purchase one and do not bother to try to make it work better than it does nsave your box and receipt so you can return it unless you want a gi joe action figure toy ni have two radios i bought at the sporting good store for 50 bucks for the set that way out perform this junker unit from cobra ni can not say anything good about this except the weather radio is handy ni bought the fj cruiser kit from walcott radio replaced everything except the radio with upgraded wilson componets i have added a picture of where i stopped and decided to get a different cb 108 inches of antenn spring is a 1 4 wave antenna and it really is hard to get better than that nto save you the trouble of trying different antennas here are the ones i tried n3 ft fire stick not good n2 ft fiberglass not good n4 ft fire stick not good plus makes a lot of humming noise on the road n102 inch wilson stainless steel whip with a 6 inch spring the best but i can yell that far ni am not the kind of person who keep track of the total cost of an inadequate product when i decide to cut my losses so i do not know for sure what all of this actually cost to have a weather radio and a kid toy gi joe action figure walky talky nwas it fun ni scraped paint off of a nice vehicle to improve my ground on the mount no fun nbought a bunch or miscellaneous duplicate parts kind of fun nroad trip into the rocky mountain range fun npointing and giggling of other off roaders at my rigs radio the worst i have had more fun at the dentist in fact i recently had two wisdom teeth taken out and that was more pleasurable than the total embarrassment of having this cobra cb ni get to go radio shopping now but guess what it wo n t be a cobra of any model
6;9;16;0.7343608039311504;i ve been using it for a while now and i like it but the power out is not the 4w they advertise before anyone jumps the antenna reflected power bandwagon i m in electronics and have tested this unit with a spectrum analyzer and dummy load for perfect matches have yet to see 4w with absolutely 0 reflected i peak at 2w i read some material where it talked about low power out but the display never shows low power mode i will put it back on my lab bench and use bench top dc power supply and provide the highest dc power it s rated for to see if that finally produces full power if that solves the problem then i ll look at returning the product it should be made to handle a normal vehicles alternator output n nas already mentioned the speaker leaves a lot to be desired they should include an external speaker as part of the cb for the price paid i ll search for an external but just because cobra does n t already provide one with an expensive cb that they know has speaker issues it wo n t be a cobra speaker n ni do like the small form factor especially for my jku it just needs some improvements to really be an awesome jeep solution
7;52;36;0.6788455463030995;i have had these installed in every vehicle owned for several years now they hold up over time and have not failed me yet the cb handset has all features included the power and antenna connector boxes can be bought separately and are easy to install just be sure to use a good antenna weather feature and noise canceling work as advertised the black plastic of the handset while looking somewhat cheap has held up well the yellow back light could use a brightness setting though very nice radio i have replaced all others with these n n4 watts output loud audio easy to use and install will last for years of use you need these in all vehicles n nworks well for logging roads and back roads how many times have you seen a sign on a logging road with a cb channel on it and not gone since you had no way to tell where the trucks were get one of these
8;42;45;0.6608046526427674;i have been using cb s for over 20 years this cb is perfect for travelers looking for a cb that takes up little space yet has a lot of features if you want a cb for road trips with weather band you should consider the 75 wx nit has a great scan feature for cb band and 10 weather channels i have owned the 75 wx for over 10 years now i have traveled coast to coast with this radio and never had a problem pulling in a weather station anywhere along the trip this would make a great rv option for a cb or for any vehicle limited on space to mount a conventional cb yes it may not be the best rig for long distance reception or transmission but so much of that is dependent on the antenna i use it with a wilson 1000 magnetic mount antenna with amazing results the soundtracker feature works great in noisy city areas if you need a cb for road trips or where space is at a premium you will not be disapointed surprisingly enough the built in speaker works really well if you need something louder the radio features a remote speaker jack i highly recommend this radio for those looking for a good 40 channel cb with weather band
9;22;14;0.6336293644448326;this cb radio works great and is very simple to install it is about the same size as a single din radio and does fit nicely into a stock radio slot nwith very little modification there is no pa switch unfortunately the description mentions that there is a switch but after installing this item i found no switch or channel for the pa there is an external speaker hookup but attaching any device to the external hookup will disconnect the default speaker this would be the most perfect cb if it had a pa switch
10;11;8;0.6072826981175246;installed this radio on my 2009 wrangler 2 door and love it so far i recommend getting firestik antenna 4 minimum if you are doing a spare tire mount and the 18 fire flex cable assembly low profile fire ring and stud you can route the cable behind the rear sub and all the way under the carpet door trim then mount the box base unit behind your glove compartment with zip ties routing the cable through the rear cargo door is a bit tricky and may be the most time consuming task in the entire project but be sure to swr tune your cb before you zip tie it or you ll be taking it back out again it s not so easy to access remember it s the antenna not the cb that determines your signal range however my experience was that the 4 firestik was that it was reasonably close to tuned with about 1 of antenna extender out swr of 1 5 on both channel 4 and 40 real world highway results of 2 5 3 5miles of range you ll need a bigger antenna if you want improved swr better range up to 11miles on a 102 antenna nfor mounting i can also recommend the roadpro rp 232 cb microphone holder black plastic at 3 vs the 30 alternative it works well and if you mount to the passenger side just left of the glove compartment allows the glove compartment to be opened without contacting the cb or cable and does n t affect shifting on a manual tranny but you ll need to upgrade to a heavy duty two sided adhesive tape that s an easy fix ni love having everything on the handheld key features for me compact form factor scanning fingertip access to squelch weather radio illuminated display backlit which is n t the best but works acceptably

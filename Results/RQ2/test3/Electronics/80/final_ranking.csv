0;13;64;0.9287940366742123;i could n t wait to recieve this hd player for christmas after literally researching hard drive based audio players for hours upon hours i came to only one logical conclusion the ihp 120 cnet is a great site and i want to thank everyone that writes legitimate reviews they helped influence my choice how can 276 people with the same product be wrong after ordering the ihp online from mac mall thank you cnet sorta ironic huh for around the nprice of 344 i realized it was cheaper than the main competitor of the iriver ipod of course an admirable product nthe main factor in my decision was nsize weight this thing is bursting with excellent features and is just about as tiny as the ipod as a 16 year old electronics fanatic i wanted the best of the best at first i wanted a nomad zen xtra i soon realized it was a slighty cosmetically upgraded technological dinosaur the thing is simply huge great price though if you are on a tight budget and have to have a hard drive player now i then wanted that oh so sleek and sexy ipod but i do not own a mac although i respect them and they do have pretty bad compatbilty issues with windows and if one was so inclined to do any pirating of music who on earth would do such a thing it is out of the question bad battery life too popular for my tastes i wanted to root for the underdog of the hard drive player market iriver that ca n t afford to produce trendy televised advertisements and such bottom line for the ipod it is too expensive and ca n t compare technically with the obviously superior ihp when i took it out of the package and picked the iriver up i was like wow this thing is extremely light yup the pictures found online do not so this thing justice you really have to see it in real life to size it up this thing is tiny this is obviously a major advantage pro nfeatures boy i do n t even know where to start if you are reading this you already know of the optical in out fm reciever internal mic recording capabilities etc i am going to do something usefull and tell you how all of these thing perform n the fm tuner is of high qualty i live in houston tx and the reception is great n the quality of the internal mic blew me away the on board mp3 encoding and options suite is beautiful i have not yet used the external mic n i have not yet used the optical twins but their usefulness is obvious and need no explanation n no needed software just drag and drop any type of file via explorer beautiful n this player has tons of great features for a great price n navigational system is great gets the job done with tact n ogg vorbis n updatable upgeadable firmaware people listen up if there are any software issues ever nmost of them can be fixed all kinds of cool new stuff can be added all bugs fixed simply beautiful n battery life is pretty good still much better than ipod n design is impeccable nquality with the magnesium body this thing is very scratch resistant unlike the shiny ipod the body itself feels very sturdy and solid no cheap sounding creaks when pressure is applied the buttons on the sides are wonderfully placed and feel extremely durable they are in small valleys indentions so they do n t annoyingly protrude the navigational joystick is a bit small but feels pretty solid i read online that to make the joystick knob more gripable it is always really dry and slick as if iriver should have put rubber on it you can apply a coat of fingernail polish overcoat to it to enhance the gripability anyways it is of very good construction props to iriver the included naccessories kick a the case is perfect wonder why there are n t any aftermarket cases the case is flawless and serves every need for a protective casing earbuds are actually ok i usually use my yamaha rh 5ma s to listen to music though ok people the earbud cord is short in order to accomadate for the length of the awesome in line remote this is hands down the best accessory it does feel a bit cheap but it is reliable and is just awesome blue backlight 4 line lcd does basically everything a usb cradle would have been nice but what are you gon na do and the speed of usb 2 0 is amazing and faster than firewire the external mic is great for recording concerts whatever tons of accessories no added cost basically i would ve bought this thing completely by itself for the same price nif you are looking for an mp3 player do n t get some dinky flash player buy this product now period they just realeased the ihp 140 go iriver n nothing is without flaws n atomzzzz 2004 nyes even the almighty iriver could be improved most of what you will read is nitpicky preferences of mine i m slightly anal retentive n the biggest dissapointment that could ve been avoided if iriver were more specific online and in their manual no database support for ogg vorbis n my hold button i ve heard others complain as well is loose it is just wiggly it drives me crazy this is something very minor and superficial and i heard iriver physically fixed this issue when they got the word so if you purchase one it will most likely be fixed n i for one prefer the ipods scroll whele for two reasons it does not protrude from the body and it is faster slightly easier cooler n do n t get me wrong i am totally for the ihp line over the ipod s but the ipod feels a little tighter sleeker probably just because i love symmetrical electronics and the ipod s lack of a protruding not by much at all though i am just picky knobby joystick and the perfectly rectangular prism body as opposed to the slight downward curve under the joystick of the iriver ihp 120 n i have n t needed to call iriver but i have heard bad things
1;43;18;0.9013079337670588;after about a month of endless research online on cnet and the reviews here at amazon i decided on the ihp 120 for my new mp3 hard drive i had previously owned a dell dj which i found to be utterly and completely useless junk and what drew me were all the features the reliability and the great sound well i have tried 3 of the most popular mp3 players on the market now the dell the apple ipod and now the iriver and let me just say that the sound is better on the iriver than any other player available the detail that came through even through the bad included ear buds i have a pair of philips but will be upgrading to grado sr 60 s was astounding i had no idea such a complex and sophisticated sound could come out of a portable mp3 player especially one so small the player is tiny the same size as the 4th gen ipod but a little thicker the included case gets the job done although i will be upgrading to the vaja leather case or the iskin when it is released another amazing feature is the connectivity transferring of songs the usb 2 0 is a joy especially when coupled with the freedom to use windows explorer instead of musicmatch or that piece of flaming s itunes but if you re the sort of person who needs more guidance in the form of software redchair has made a download called irivium explorer that should do the trick also the remote is good as well it s much much much smaller than i expected about the size of your thumb and it s really handy except for the cord which is too long and has the tendency to get tangled with the cord of your headphones the equalizers that can be set up on the ihp 120 are amazing too and the volume that the player can go to without distorting the sound is very impressive the fm tuner works great no static and the internal mic also fulfills my needs the layout takes some getting used to and if you have n t already done this and your collection is small i would recommend converting your files to mp3 format the database function is a joy although the recent firmware upgrade may support ogg wma database files i m not sure the controls are n t impossible to learn though and once you do they make sense also the player just looks great it has a big screen and a very shiny black surface that feels as if it cost much more than it actually did in my opinion it looks much better than the dell or the rio karma and just as good as if not better than the ipod and the new creative zen touch i have n t found the joystick button to be a problem on the contrary i think it s a cool and unique feature i have only 2 bones to pick with this player the playlist feature and the shuffle feature i m sure you ve read this before but the shuffle is n t really shuffle it plays the tracks in the same random order each time and you ca n t create playlists in the field you have to use winamp or irivium which i have n t tried yet but these are minor gripes considering iriver has promised to fix these in firmware upgrades it ca n t be long now but overall i think this player has everything you could want in a portable digital audio device room for 5000 mp3 songs great features and great sound all packed into a very attractive package so forget the repulsive and oppressive ipod franchise and say hello to iriver
2;5;72;0.8949969044513876;i ve been using this player and it s great although there are many choices out there iriver did a great job the second time around ihp 100 was the first cut some of the features i like are n n remote a must have since it s really inconvenient having to take out the main unit in order to change settings like the volume or songs n n no drivers or software needed to copy over songs it can be a big headache when you have to install software just to move files over when all you want to do is a copy one of the reasons why i did n t go w creative is due to their bloatware since it looks like an external toshiba hard drive when you plug it in it s can be used for external storage there s 20gb and i was n t able to fill it up with songs that i like i ve used up only 5gb so far the extra space is great for use as a portable hard drive if your computer supports usb hdd you can boot from it too n n upgradeable firmware os the nice thing about this is that no mp3 player is perfect the 1st 2nd or 3rd time around having this upgradeable firmware allows them to add fix features i ve already submitted a few nice to haves to iriver although i have n t received any response such as on the fly playlists deleting from the player directly statistics like running time clock feature smaller fonts etc i hope they ll be able to put this into the next firmware upgrade they re currently on version 1 17 n n many formats this can play almost every format mp3 wma asf wav available and even ogg n n many extras it comes with a nice leather carrying case to protect the ihp that has the holes for the buttons although you wo n t use them often since everything is accessible from the remote a very decent set of earphones usb 2 0 cable line in cable external microphone and a 2 inch headphone extension cord since the plug on the remote is recessed in a bit it s nice that you plug your headphones into the remote as opposed to the main unit because this accomodates short headphone cords like my sony fontopia earbuds n n solid design construction when you first put this in your hand you know they did n t skimp on the materials everything feels solid not that cheap and light plastic is a bad thing and made from metal even the glass on the remote is extra thick so you do n t have to worry about pressing too hard on the lcd and breaking it n n optical out and in i used to store mp3s on my hard drive but now i store it on the ihp when i put it on my desk to charge i plug this into the klipsch 5 1 system via the optical outputs and the sound is crisp and there s no distortion because it s digital the optical outs also doubles as analog in outputs the leather case covers up these openings to keep them clean n n many configuration options and many more to come that can be accessed from the main unit and from the remote you can configure the equalizer to use srs wow trubass and even ca n t the presets even the scroll speed is configurable n n sounds good the sound is also very loud and crisp w more than enough bass it even has a feature that will fade in the song so that you do n t get a sudden loud start in the song i ve placed a request to them so hopefully in the next version they might have some sort of normalization between all songs n n fm am tuner the tuner on this unit gets great reception because i live in nyc i have a lot of stations i have enough presets from all of the stations i want you can also configure different backlight options when it s connected to an adapter and when it s connected by battery sleep time fade in n n many repeat options repeat or random shuffle by 1 song 1 directory all directories n n crisp lcd display on main unit and remote the fonts and display are very sharp n n good battery life i get over 10 hours so far on a single charge i have n t listened to them any longer that so it might of gone longer after 10 hours i still got 1 out of 4 bars left n n search by genre artists album song title this feature is really nice when you have songs scattered throughout different folders i can say i want to hear all songs from name of artist even if they re in different directories this features requires you to build a scandb from the computer but it s easy you ll just need to right click from the computer the ihp drive that shows up and select generate db this is the only feature that requires a driver installation note your songs need an id3 tag for this to work n n song queuing you can queue a song while another one is playing this is a minor feature but extremely useful n n usb 2 0 this is really important when you re transferring over hundreds of songs using usb 1 1 12mbps it would take over several minutes to transfer ten 5 mb songs while it takes usb 2 0 480mbps 10 20 seconds n n displays non english id3 tags this can display chinese id3 tags n n playlist support it can use up to 200 playlists m3u so you can create a playlist of your favorite songs from winamp and use it on the ihp nsome cons although minor n ca n t play music while plugged into the usb port this might not be too bad since you can play it off w winamp when it s plugged in n n using the search by genre artist slows the boot up time by 5 10 seconds if you do n t need this feature you can turn it off n n no docking station not a big deal since remote can stand upright by itself on the table n 20 gb drive i m sure there s a way to replace the drive with a bigger one but this size is more than sufficient n more expensive than most other 20gb players n nyou can see all the time and effort they ve put into this mp3 player although some of the features are minor it is the time they ve put into details that make this a great player if you want the bmw of mp3 players you got ta pay bmw prices overall the feature set and quality sound and hardware wise are perfect most of the minor issues and features can be fixed with future firmware upgrades you ca n t go wrong w this
3;2;73;0.8915749360286812;dont get me wrong the ipod is great it is by far the best design on the market but it does fall short in some areas and the iriver picks up that slack ni decided to look at brands other than the ipod because most of my files are wma s and i did not feel like converting all of them i did a lot of research and got it down to two players the rio karma and the iriver ihp 120 i went with the iriver because it had many features that i was looking for that the rio did not ni have had it now for about a month now and let me just put it like this the ipod is not the only heavy hitter anymore if someone were to offer me either right now free i would take the iriver here is why nwhat the ipod has over the iriver n cool design n user friendly interface scroll wheel n firewire although iriver does have usb2 nwhat the iriver has over the ipod n 4 line lcd remote so that you can see what is happening n 16 hour lithium poly battery ipod has a 6 hour n wma compatable for windows users n no software needed shows up as an external hard drive just drag and drop onto or from any computer without drivers this includes non music files n recording from any source has optical in out and comes with an internal and external mic n music is laid out the way you want it to be because you put it on there how you want it n fm radio tuner built in nbottom line is that it lookes great sounds great has a great remote and lots of features that you do n t see on most players nthis is not a review to say that apple is no good i am just saying that too many people seem to go into the search with blinders on and not see what else is out there in my opinion the iriver ihp 120 is becuase of all the reasons i listed the better player for me and i am very glad that i got it instead of the ipod if you are a pc user you need to check it out before you buy nhope i helped
4;18;24;0.8897153862176634;since amazon wo n t let me update my previous review of the ihp 140 i ll list it under the ihp 120 n nfurther evaluation of the iriver ihp 140 n nfour months ago in april i posted a review of iriver s ihp 140 mp3 jukebox on amazon since then i have received many emails and questions about this great device if this review is still on line i would urge you to read it as a preface to this review n nthree weeks after mailing the email letter sent to support iriveramerica com and after sending it again recently 2004 august i have not received an acknowledgment of the inquiry let alone hope of pending solutions to the issues which i have discovered with the ihp 140 n nunlike other companies iriver lists no phone number or mailing address either on their website or the user manual n ntherefore i am hoping that readers who notice the same problems with this device will send email to support iriveramerica com to ask for support and solutions n nmy evaluation of the ihp 140 may be summarized as follows n nhardware awesome robust compact and very capable not only is it a nice toy but a 40 gb hd which connects to your computer by usb encodes analog audio to mp3 and has a quick charging long lasting battery built in n nfirmware needs improvement the issues are described below n nsupport poor n ndear sirs n nin april i purchased the iriver ihp 140 since then i have recorded over 300 hours of microphone and line in sound and have done usb data transfer becoming acutely aware of its strengths and weaknesses each is a separate issue and they should be assessed by your technical management and addressed separately and hopefully improved with a firmware upgrade n nmy background it might be helpful for you to be aware of my extensive experience in sound recording during the 60s i did considerable recording using reel to reel tape in both stereo and 4 track when sound quality became adequate in the 70s i switched to cassette tape recording in stereo including dolby nr technology in the late 90s my medium for recording sound became the minidisc with atrac compression using the sony mz r50 recorder this device failed recently and after extensive research i decided to purchase the iriver i wrote an evaluation of this recorder for amazon which is apparently still posted and have received and replied to numerous email questions about the ihp 140 based upon my not completely satisfactory experience this puts me in a rather awkward position of being both a critic and supporter of your product n nprogramming issues n nmp3 compression the algorithm used for mp3 compression is defective below 128 kbps at 44khz sample rate the sound quality is damaged by artifacts which sound like phasor flanger effects becoming worse as the bit rate lowers using computer wav to mp3 conversion i have extensively used 80 kbps satisfactorily but the sound quality is not acceptable at that rate using the ihp 140 and is much worse at lower rates the artifacts include frequencies which are not part of the original sound this must be corrected n nrecord pause indication as programmed the ihp 140 indicates pause by flashing the tiny elapsed time figure this is difficult to see under low light conditions it would make a lot more sense to flash the large record indicator n nrecord file name indication when placed in record mode before recording begins no file name is shown because the recorder was built without any time date indicator i must write this information down in order to maintain the dates of my recordings and do not have the file name information available unless i hit the record pause twice this change should be exceedingly easy to implement it would certainly not matter if the track of that filename was not used n n from information available to me prior to purchasing this unit i did not recognize that it did not have an internal clock as my computer digital camera cell phone camcorder and md recorder contain the reasons for this are understandable as iriver did not choose to add the small amount of extra hardware to implement an internal clock and felt the extra power consumed by it merited this decision this was certainly the wrong decision for my purposes and i would not have purchased this unit if i have realized this omission n nplayback error if the unit s function using the record button is changed directly from record to playback after playing for a few minutes occasionally the track being played will skip to the next track or just stop even though the current track has no record errors if the recorder is powered down and restarted the track will play correctly bug n nbacklighting of display it was good design to allow the duration of display backlighting to be selected by the user but when the unit is first powered up the display backlighting duration is fixed shutting off just a moment before the record setup screen appears making it difficult to ascertain when the record button may be pressed to begin recording in conditions of low lighting n nplayback fast forwarding many of my recordings are over an hour in length and the fastest rate available is much too slow to get to the middle of that recording session in a reasonable time this is a tough one i can not suggest how to make this function manageable n nvolume control i discovered that the volume control affects not only the headphone output but also the line output on all other audio devices i have used line out has a standard level unaffected by any volume controls somebody in your design team seems to have missed this n nflow chart in the user manual would be useful it would be easy for an engineer and useful for engineer users like me to present the functions of the ihp 140 with a flowchart showing which function results from which button pushes i could suggest one but would not offer this effort without a guarantee of compensation n nin summary the hardware of the ihp 140 is excellent but it should have been user tested more completely before releasing it to the public for sale one reason i chose this unit for purchase is that the firmware is upgradeable please consider my suggestions for your first available upgrade and notify me by email when improvements are available n n drchick mindspring com n nchick hebert n nthe media guy
5;36;16;0.884356046038065;i have owned my ihp 120 same as the h120 just a different name for a little over 6 months now i just upgraded the firmware last night to version 1 60 which gave me the ability to speed up slow down mp3s which will work great for some of my audio books have n t tested it yet it also gave me gapless playback something i am currently testing out i have n t listened to a live album since turning this setting on so i can not comment it gave me other stuff that i have little interest in as well n ni bought this unit after considering the competition there were two other competitors who i now forget and it is n t really important at this point n ni would really like to have an ipod because of the database functionality helps to organize rate your music i also like the styling and the ease of use of the ipod n nthis jukebox does it all however effectively blowing away all others it has a built in fm tuner important for me because i use this on my motorcycle and like to get local news events weather where i go n nit has an included remote important for me because of my motorcycle the remote unit clips on nicely to my tankbag and has a long enough cord to hide the actual unit n nit has a surprisingly nice leather carrying case from experience i have found that the leather carrying case helps protect the unit when dropped on the pavement from a height of about 4 about the height of the tank bag on my motorcycle the carrying case really helps to keep the unit clean and scratch free i am anal about that n nthe sound is outstanding i am using a cheap pair of sony mdr g52 headphones and they sound great i ve used this with a pair of the latest generation bose noise canceling headphones and the sound was incredible n nthe level of detail that is displayed on the playing song is very good if you follow the window s media folder structure you will be able to identify your songs quite well if you use wma s like i do n nthis unit acts as a mass storage device when connected via usb to your pc very nice n nbasic operation is adequate and somewhat intuitive the unit has a lot of functionality that i just have n t used unfortunately some of that functionality involves those two really cool optical ports one reason for buying this unit i had dreams of connecting this to my home stereo something i have yet to do n none thing that i was real upset about was the database functionality during my research i did n t uncover the fact that the database only pulls id tags from mp3 files only if you use wma like me you are out of luck and have to rely on your folder structure which is n t all that bad after all the latest firmware added ogg vorbis tags to the list which doesnt help me as i do n t use that format n nive used this mainly for music however on a few long trips i have used this for audiobooks the 16 hour battery life really helps on long flights layovers etc if all you are doing is listening to one audiobook you re fine shut the unit off and when you start it back up it will pick up where you left off if you want to listen to some music in the middle of an audiobook you have to remember where you left off wait for the end of a chapter so you can get back to it the addition of bookmark capabilities would be very helpful n nif you have a lot of music make sure you are certain 20gb is enough i have about 30gb of music which means i have to prune 33 of my music to fit on this that is not an easy task if you are eclectic like me you simply have to have it all for that reason this unit will be going on ebay some time soon and i will be purchasing the 40gb model either the h140 or the h340 i like the extra space for more music n nfirmware updates are few and far between release dates slipping by months at a time if you buy this make sure you buy it for the capabilities it has and not for something you think will be added in the future bookmarks etc n nall in all this is well worth the money i am happy with my purchase and am planning on upgrading soon
6;1;37;0.8669781447298551;i recently bought the iriver ihp 120 h120 at best buy i had a 10 off coupon so bought it for 300 at the same time my roommate had bought a 15 gb ipod so i had ample chance to play with both the players i must tell you that i love the iriver player this has got lot more features quality for lesser price nthings i liked n1 the quality of the music is amazing n2 it plays all the formats that i generally use n3 the radio is very clear n4 feels robust n5 small almost the same size as ipod n6 comes with all the accessories my roomate had to buy leathercase and usb cable n7 can be used as an external harddisk no drivers needed no software needs to be installed just plug n play n8 the recording feature though i have n t used this feature yet online reviews tell me that the quality of recording is just awesome n9 awesome battery life nthings i did not like n1 the leathercase has a belt clip through which you have to pass a belt to keep it on your waist in the gym i wear gym shorts and i do n t wear a belt so i have to hold it in my hand and run i would have liked a clip on type belt clip n2 the ear phones that come with the set are not the best n3 the led is kind of dim comapred to the ipod nipod vs iriver n1 iriver comes with radio recording and accessories the ipod does not n2 in iriver i do n t have to install any software and arranage all my songs i can just drag and drop all the folders in the player i like this arrangement compared to the id3 tags in ipod you have to arrange all your songs using id3 tags my roomate spent the whole memorial day weekend arranging his songs n3 ipod can not be used as an external hard drive iriver can be used as an external hard drive no drivers need to be installed just drag n drop n4 the quality of music is about the same in both the players best quality n5 iriver s battery life is double compared to ipod 16 hrs to 8hrs n6 the ipod looks cooler and i loved the button placement sensitivity of the buttons of the ipod n7 the ipod s ear buds are too cool nbottom line if you want more bang for your buck and looks do n t matter that much go with the iriver
7;73;34;0.8590841691066955;and settled on the iriver i have not been disappointed after 2 months of frequent use i have this to say about the product it has at least 100 longer battery life than my ipod it has a great durable feel to it i like the fact that it acts as an external hard drive i do n t use the database function because all my files are in wma format i use media player as my jukebox on my computer and it does a nice job of labelling the folders the music goes in so there s been little hassle organizing music onto my iriver a word of advice if your music is n t well organized it can take a long time to find things on the iriver the firmware is upgradeable which means bugs can be fixed regularly although i have n t yet encountered one it also sounds great i replaced the standard earbuds with shure e 2c s and this thing sounds killer n nmy cons list is short i do n t like the fact that i ca n t create playlists on the fly i wish the database function worked with file types other than mp3 i also wish the player supported more codecs like flac and shorten i am clinging to the hope that these issues can be looked at with firmware upgrades n nupdate 8 3 04 nmy unit crashed after less than 60 days of ownership and relatively light use it is fried and iriver is in the process of getting me a new one i am worried because of all the negative reviews on iriver service but i m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt if they take care of me on this one nonetheless this product is not as great as i first believed 2 stars
8;9;36;0.8551807588656;let me begin my stating that the iriver hardware is simply top notch the device itself is compact the battery life is great the sound quality is superb assuming you are n t using the included earbuds the full function backlit 4 line lcd in line remote is a godsend the player can be accessed simply as a hard drive it plays a large number of file formats etc nhowever i am regrettably returning this thing to the store why because iriver simply makes it too damn hard to get music onto the device from my cd collection n1 there is no included ripping organizing software zilch nada what you get on cd is drivers so a win98 box can talk to it and a small program to create the database file so your player can access the music by artist or genre or album or track name without the database you navigate your songs solely with a directory tree n2 while you can easily download software that will perform what i am complaining about in 1 no one package will do it all for you to rip a cd you have to do the following using programs you scrounge up from the internet yourself iriver is no help na rip the cd with the program of your choice this program will also need to sort them into sane directories for when the database does n t work nb run another program to make sure that no filenames are longer than 48 characters why because the database function wo n t work otherwise with pop music this is n t a problem but it sure is with classical music for example from hilary hahn s bach concerto s cd cddb returns the following track name 10 concerto for obe violin strings continuo in c minor bwv 1060 1 allegro nc run a third program to sync up your directory tree w the iriver if you just drag n drop it takes a lot longer nd run a fourth program to build the iriver s internal database n3 the filename must start with the track number if it does n t the player sorts the files in an album in alphabetical order which is a big no no for lots of classical music along with musicals and classic albums that were simply meant to be played in the right order like the greatful dead too bad this makes the search by track function completely useless the player is too stupid to use the track number tag in most music files n4 re that silly 48 character limit i mentioned earlier a program that simply truncates the filename is n t gon na work the track name that cddb returned really is the title of the piece i could abbreviate but i really do n t feel like doing that by hand for every cd that needs it n5 scrolling scrolling through a long list of anything on this device is slow a progressive scroll speed ala creative would work wonders n6 on the fly playlists i used this function w my dearly departed creative nomad jukebox 2 all i want to do is queue up several tracks and or artists and or albums to play nope ca n t do it this feature is promised by iriver real soon now via a firmware upgrade but i m not holding my breath ni am a geek for a living but my time is more valuable than spending hours fighting with my consumer electronics nif you already have a pile of neatly sorted mp3 s with short filenames and tagged with track numbers on your computer then this player is great simply drag your music collection onto the player and you are good to go if you have an extensive cd collection you need to rip you could have a problem
9;53;56;0.8503003112880771;i have read most of the reviews for this product and there is one huge feature that people fail to point out this feature imho blows all mp3s out of the water the iriver can also mimick as an external hdd you can store any file on it you can backup your laptop on it i would n t do that because i want music on my player however with the diminishing floppy cd dvd burning the coming of age of the memory stick this is the mother of all file transfers just plug it into the usb port either 1 1 or 2 0 just lack of speed is the difference of your computer windows recognizes the player as a mass storage device and creates a driver letter for it after that you can create your own directory structure on the player and drag and drop any file onto it only the files that the player recognizes will show up in the iriver s display nthis player has been quipped the techies mp3 player but do not let that discourage you from thinking there is something hard about setting it up there absolutely is n t it just comes load with features reads five different file types and has all kinds of equalizer options including srs a voice recorder tune into fm radio stations optical line in and out and more nin comparison of a swiss army knife the ipod is the little thing you attach to your keychain the iriver is the big multifunctional tool that needs a little poach to be carried in properly neven though the player is a bit bigger than most other players it comes with a remote that has all the functions that you could do on the player so throw the player in your backpack and clip the remote to your shirt or belt or whatever and enjoy the great sound that comes out of this player noh the iriver also comes with a leather case to keep it from getting scratched up just look at the list of stuff this thing can do above and compare it against any mp3 player there is no competition nso please think twice before buying into pop culture and looking stylish n i m not affiliated with iriver in anyway i just really like this product and want to spread the word that the ipod is a piece of marketing junk
10;50;57;0.8094790778865866;i looked for a long time at mp3 players and i ended up buying both the ipod and this one i did n t like the ipod for a couple of reasons the short battery life the easily scratched case the neccessity to use itunes software and no carrying case or radio not to mention the price nwell it just happens that this iriver eliminates all of those things plus throws in a voice recorder that i will never use but it s cool to have nthis player is so easy you simply plug it in your computer recognizes it as a drive and you simply drag and drop music to it it s that easy no messy interfaces no itunes no musicmatch if you can use windows explorer you can use this nthe sound is good with one exception if you are listening in a quiet room you can hear the harddrive moving through the headphones it sounds like a bit of static from a radio station it is annoying but it s not bad especially if there is any other background noise i only notice it between songs or when the song goes silent for a second nother then that this is perfect the case is really nice the remote is cool and it is very easy to use and the battery life is awesome i ve used it for eight hours and my battery is only half gone and this is a lithium polymer battery as opposed to a lithium ion which means two things one the battery life is longer and two the recharge capacity is 3000 times as opposed to 300 times on one more thing you can also charge it at any time as opposed to only when it s dead there is no memory fuction with the polymer battery it might not look quite as cool as the ipod although it still looks cool but the battery itself is reason to buy this over the ipod especially if you are a windows user
11;26;20;0.7967495040326121;i ll admit it the ihp 120 was n t the first hdd player i bought i opted instead for the rio karma and do n t get me wrong it s a solid little player but when compared to the iriver it s easily trumped in terms of features and durability anyway i have no regrets whatsoever about exchanging it for this fantastic piece of equipment mp3 player am fm tuner portable usb hard drive e reader personal recorder you name it this baby can do it and do it better than any other player on the market n nthe good n n foolproof with all the features you d think it would be difficult to use the thing however that s the furthest thing from the truth n n plug n play no software needed just drag drop nuff said however adding the database function can be useful also all that extra space can be put to good use holding files you do n t want cluttering up your hard drive on your pc n n whoa damn customize the sound to your liking this thing sounds awesome but the srs and wow eq effects sound horrible and are useless in my opinion n n bling bling everything you could ask for and a whole lot more including an in line remote the best of the bunch line in cable adapter case external mic n n say what record music or voice from almost anywhere just use the mic or plug the unit into a headphone jack or optical out n n juice it up battery life is pretty close to what iriver claims and among the best in its class n n too many to list n nthe bad n n the player uses winamp m3u playlists which is great but lacks the tools to create or edit a playlist on the fly a minor gripe n n you need to connect to a pc to edit or delete any content again minor n n joystick works well for navigation but it s a bit slippery n n the included earbuds actually sound pretty decent with good bass response but they are too large and do n t fit well and besides they re grey and do n t match the player at all i d recommend the sony mdr ex71sl s not only do they sound awesome they have a shortened cord for use with the remote they re dirt cheap when compared to high end models like grado and shure and they complement the ihp 120 perfectly n nthe ugly n nthe worst thing about the ihp 120 is that it looks too damn good i m always wiping my fingerprints off the chrome lol n nthe bottom line n nif you re looking for a hdd player then look no further unless you re a conformist or if supporting apple is some weird political trip for you iriver all the way
12;49;4;0.7851900972071836;i bought this mp3 player for 3 reasons n n1 the voice recorder n n2 the built in radio gigage n n3 its something different other than an ipod n nthings that are wrong about this product n n1 the catagoization of the songs an iriver is a drag and drop system with a db scan that will enable you to browse through artist album ect the only problem is if you do n t have your mp3 files properly id tagged it wo n t even recognize it dont get scared they will still go on the mp3 player just it will be slightly harder to find which is a slight inconvience that is noticible and even if your files are tagged sometimes the iriver n nstill wo n t recognize it that was frustrating where as the ipod has a system through itunes i believe that is somewhat better n n2 the voice recorder it comes with an external mic and a built in mic the problem is with the interal mic about every 30 seconds the iriver will sahy load or refresh and that produces a noise so if you listen to your recorded work about every 30 seconds a distinct wizzing sound will appear and that was extremely annoying n n3 the button control is much more complex and at sometimes confusing i applaud the ipod for staying simple n n4 the remote gets in the way with its long cord plus if it is a remote why does it have a cord at all n n5 the earphones carrying case is a piece of crap n n6 although i have n t timed it out i find hard to believe that the so called 16 hour battery life actually lasts 16 hours do n t get me wrong it lasts longer than my ipod but not 16 hours n nthings i liked n n1 its not an ipod n n2 the quality of the sound is definately improved much more than the ipod n n3 the radio works great n n4 the radio recorder combo if you want these in an ipod you will have to pay extra n n4 so some of my songs that skipped the iriver elliminated it n n5 its unique if you buy this people will notice it and you can brag about it n n6 tech support always answers my questions within 24 hours n nall in all i am pleased with this product n ni would recommed it if you are a man who is very familiar with technology if you a clueless simple guy go with the ipod i still like it more than the ipod because it does more for me
13;75;59;0.7722657574661408;positives n slick lcd remote you control every function of the play using that tiny thing n amazing srs trubass system you can clearly hear the difference in sounds it does a great job of emphasizing bass n directory file system drag and drop and a database mode n one button that controls almost everything n usb 2 0 fast n microphone recording ability n long battery life n nice leather case n its amazing to use once you get used to the functions and learn to add songs and create playlists nnegatives n somewhat of a learning curve when you try to add songs into the database you ll get failure errors and no db errors you have to search through all your songs to fix them manually failure occurs when your song name is too long and nodb shows up when your id3 tags are n t the correct version n playlists do n t work unless you manually edit them using notepad to delete the directory for example it would say h music pop xxx mp3 i needed to delete the h part to get things to work i used winamp5 to create playlists n wires get out of hand the combined length of the remote cord and the headphone cord creates a mess n no extra stuff the ipod comes with games and news nthe largest negatives can be solved within a day of using it its a great player that can match up to any other hd based player 20gb is n t the cheapest on the market but it is small packed with functionality and amazing sound this deal can not be beat
14;55;10;0.7567329783155134;ive had this player for about 6 months now it is absolutely fantastic and holds up tremendously well i got this because im a commuter and i needed to occupy my downtime i also have the availability to listen to music at work too this player lasts all day long with hardly a dent in battery life transferring music from your hard drive to this player is easier than learning how to snap your fingers and it plays everything no proprietary software necessary or converting files to play the best part is the built in radio it works fantastically and its a pleasure to change up my music tastes from my own collection once in a while personally the radio capabilities is its biggest sell for me i love listening to morning radio talk shows and then my stuff in the afternoon the included remote is awesome too what other company includes a remote this good you can control everything on it and never need to take the player out of your bag it comes with its own case although i do n t use it anymore the plastic and metal is very strong and scratch resistant too as ive inadvertantly tested it by mistake a couple times the last thing i have to say is customer service for iriver is top notch i had a problem with the remote after a while of heavy usage and they sent me a new one no questions asked everyone was so professional and polite see if you could get that from apple after youve taken the product home
15;44;6;0.5952947217161334;you can read all the reviews about the specs and technical stuff but in my opinion the one thing that makes this player worth every single penny is the optical line out grab a toslink cable and connect directly to your optical line in to your receiver the sound is incredible i no longer need to rummage thru my cd collection this is absolutely the best feature in my view and until other players include it i m sticking to my ihp

0;4;100;0.8863806267065354;it s unclear when it all began somewhere in the last couple of decades the quality worldband radio receiver slowly faded away the great names on the shortwave units of yesteryear are now either slapping their badges on drugstore discount south asian made devices or have stopped making radios altogether the solid metal the dials and switches the detailed engineering all drifted away and replaced with toy grade plastic fewer features and let s see how cheap we can build it design with the exception of one n nat first glance you know right away that the made in japan sony icf sw7600gr is definitely not available at your corner shoppe much less your local electronics store the interface consists of 27 buttons 5 switches and 3 knobs there are two clocks and two alarms there s two output jacks headphone line out right next to the antenna jack the whip antenna is nearly a full yard in length serious indeed but as intimidating as it all seems at first the flowchart logical layout is very efficient and anyone who s ever wished their radio had something more than just a stereo mono switch to get a weak signal is accommodated in more ways than one n nthe seriousness continues when you pick up the 7600gr though it s considered a coat pocket portable it feels as though it s filled with concrete or perhaps lead shot if weight is a sign of quality the 7600gr makes itself unabashedly clear weighing in at just over 15 ipod nanos 1 and 1 3 pounds the positive click buttons would be at home in a luxury car the knobs turn smoothly and switches move confidently into position nothing is loose or rattles everything is buttoned down and solid you could say it feels german but they stopped making portable radios long ago n nyet all the forethought and engineering that went into the exterior is just the prelude to what s on the inside this would still be a top tier portable just on it s receiver components alone but sony goes a step further piling on the professional tuning features one of which the synchronous detector is not found on portables from any other manufacturer the 7600gr is a veritable box of solutions to the all too common radio reception problems the this weak station is being drowned out by a powerful station problem the this station is almost clear except for a weak station in the background problem the how can i get rid of this high pitched interference problem etc without getting too technical this is a very sensitive receiver on its own and should reception fall short there s a barrage of trick electronic tuning tools to try out n nof course no radio is perfect and the 7600gr is n t immune there s no knob for tuning which is all done by buttons the case is too small for high fidelity sound from the speaker the backlight is for the display only not the buttons but this is all nitpicking in light of pure tuner power you wo n t miss the tuning knob when you get that one near impossible station that no other radio you ve tried can get n nif you browse around the internet for 7600gr reviews from experienced radio technicians you ll find that they essentially come in two categories the first is i kept having problem x with radio y so i just went and got a 7600gr and the second is i spent more on my radio rig than i did my car so when i needed a portable i got a 7600gr there are n t any lengthy tirades about technical issues or design failures just page after page of happy owners sharing their techniques and experiences another amazon reviewer noted that the sony is the best shortwave radio under 200 but this is really selling it short portable shortwave radios only go up to about 200 and not counting used units there are n t any more until you reach the very technical world of tabletop receivers starting at 500 so in reality this is the best shortwave radio under 500 n nthe key to the 7600gr s success is time the original icf sw7600 was introduced way back in 1977 and since then has gone through a miasma of subtle design changes and technical innovations so as other manufacturers try to find cheaper ways to produce their all new models sony has been slowly honing and refining this single design all along for over 25 years you can be confident when you hold the 7600gr that it s the time tested culmination of over a quarter century of engineering and design five stars for sony s instant classic
1;7;120;0.8741761171623726;i have been using the 7600 no suffix the grand daddy of the 7600gr since its debut in 1992 that s close to 14 years of faithful problem free service until it finally died on me recently i was sad to see it go but was all prepared to look for a better alternative after ploughing through numerous reviews both online and off i was pleasantly surprised to learn that its direct descendant the 7600gr still rates among the top portable receivers today they are practically identical aside from some pretty superficial changes i did appreciate the 100 station presets that s useful for someone who uses it for listening to shortwave stations which change frequencies a lot depending on the time of day and the season aside from that little else has changed reception wise they re close to identical but far from a fault it s an indication of how well designed the 7600 was in the first place i ve seldom seen electronic appliances staying practically the same after more than a decade in service and still retain close to top spot in consumer reviews sony deserves congratulations for that n nin terms of build quality i can attest to their ruggedness these babies were built to last my trusty old 7600 has been on the open ocean baked in the sun drenched in rain wrapped in plastic of course subjected to leaky batteries dropped several times and given dutiful uncomplaining service for over a decade where can you find electronic equipment built like that these days n nthere has been a lot of unhappiness with regards to the absence of an adaptor transformer for the 7600gr the original accompanying adaptors in the american market initially the ac e90hg and then the ac e60a were noted to be unshielded giving rise to rf interference with mw sw listening after sony recalled them it seems sony did not replace the adaptor as part of the standard package in america after reading reviews about the adaptor i had quite decided against buying it however i managed to get the 7600gr while in singapore 2 months ago it was a direct japanese import and it came with a new ac adaptor i m not sure if this version is properly shielded but i ve not noticed any increased interference with sw listening viz ac power and batteries note that this package is not the one offered on amazon my only complaint is that my original 7600 s adaptor transformer came with a 12 foot long cable meaning i could place it anywhere in the room the new adaptor for the 7600gr is barely 6 feet in length also my original 7600 came with ear phones for stereo listening on fm the new 7600gr does not n nreception as far as i can tell is no different from the old model despite the addition of the highly rated synchronous detector circuit that s in part because after so many years i know exactly which stations i want to listen to and no longer go searching for them i listen to both sw and fm stations i tune to include the bbc radio australia radio new zealand and occasionally deutsche welle and nederlands they sound the same on both n nthese days with the internet you no longer have to slowly scan for stations on sw the easiest way is to go to their websites download their frequency charts and just directly program them into the preset memory actually many stations also broadcast online so much easier than in the past but with a certain loss of that old mystique anticipation and sense of adventure n ni d like to correct a statement made in one of the prior reviews removing the batteries for more than 60secs will not erase the station presets the presets are stored in eeprom which will not be erased with any power loss what will be erased is the current time on the radio s clock but that s very easily reset n nthe built in tin can speaker is the only part of the 7600 that i dislike unfortunately that has not improved but with the proliferation of cheap fairly good quality desktop speakers to connect to you are spoilt for choice i bought mine together with the 99 klipsch 2 0 ultra the resultant sound is as good as you can hope to get from a world band receiver for private listening at night i prefer sennheisers they make a world of difference especially when listening to fm stereo n nsome appreciative words for sony i managed to get my trusty old 7600 repaired in singapore at the local sony outlet for the equivalent of about 40 dirt cheap for what they replaced the worn out crystal dc transformer over a dozen capacitors and an equal number of switches what i appreciated most was the fact that they repaired it with no questions asked despite the fact that it was over 10 years old had no proof of purchase no warranty and was no longer in production if you want to know what makes a loyal customer it is a company that stands by its product now i am the happy owner of 2 perfectly serviceable portable receivers one for home and one for travel

contains just the controls necessary to bring in signals clearly thereby eliminating much complication that can cause difficulty in use n nits main claim to shortwave fame in addition to its overall superb design is its inclusion of a synchronous detection circuit as well as full single sideband ssb reception available on no other currently available new receiver in its size and or price class this circuit can make the difference between hearing a station or not hearing it it can almost totally eliminate interference from a close by frequency the circuit also works on the am band and eliminates selective fading distortion commonly heard around dawn dusk or evenings when listening to distant stations the skywave comes in slightly behind the groundwave or the skywave itself comes in out of phase and causes distortion on other radios which makes an announcer sound as though he she has a very bad cold this annoyance will not occur on this sony n nfor shortwave listening it is quite

especially with use of the synchronous circuit but what is unexpected is how well this relatively small radio receives long distance stations at my location canada cuba and the dominican republic often come in like locals other stations from around the country do so likewise these signals come in loud and very clear one would not expect such high quality performance from a radio this size and while some other radios in this category may be as sensitive as this sony not one of them has the synchronous detection circuit which cleans up the received am signal and makes it fully listenable n nfm sensitivity selectivity and capture ratio are all excellent n nthis radio has been manufactured unchanged since 2001 its predecessor model from which there were only minor changes dates back to 1994 incredibly in all this time no other manufacturer has been able to design a radio even equal to this sony much less superior n nits construction quality is absolutely first rate it is still manufactured in japan for sony by towada audio corporation a company located in kosaka a town in the kazuno district akita japan they actually developed the radio unlike all other compact shortwave portables which are manufactured in china or rarely in taiwan japanese build quality has long been noted for it excellence and this difference really shows believe me just a cursory hands on examination or comparison between this one and any other receiver in its class will confirm that its construction quality is second to none and is even better than some tabletop communications receivers n nin order to buy something better you would have to spend at least three times the price of this radio and what you would get the eton e1 for example would not be anywhere nearly as portable as this one nor will its construction quality match that of this sony n nsome people have complained about the whip antenna being somewhat delicate in fact all whip antennas can be damaged

one minute to replace n nsound quality is pretty good great for news talk somewhat less so for music on fm but even this can easily and inexpensively be corrected by means of a cable available from

batteries a set lasts a very long time and of course rechargeable ones can be recharged over and over again n nthe radio has over 100 memories 100 regular memories 2 more memories for the alarm clock function and one each for the bottom of each shortwave frequency band these memories do not disappear when changing or even removing the batteries they are totally non volatile and will remain essentially forever until you manually change or delete them even the clock remains for several minutes while changing the batteries if however you remove the batteries for a long time then you will have to reset the clock this is very easy to do and is the only thing necessary to reset there are in fact two clocks one of which can be set to your local time and the other which can be set to any time zone you desire i have mine set to utc gmt when you set the local time the other time zone is automatically set as well so you only have to set the clock once n nsony no longer offers a suitable ac adapter for this radio however radio shack does and the radio shack ac adapter cat 273 025 the appropriate adapt a plug free with purchase of the adapter is cat 273 1705 is not only better than sony s original it is smaller and lighter in weight and less expensive costing only 12 99 this adapter and plug can be bought at any local radio shack store as well as online if you wish it is too bad that amazon does not sell this adapter n nall in all this radio especially at amazon s current price just can not be beaten in terms of value for money n nit is in my opinion the best value in a shortwave receiver currently on the market and in a world full of often ephemeral electronic gizmos one of the few genuine electronic bargains n nthis is a radio that the owner will never outgrow n n n nupdate may 16 2008 n nto improve shortwave reception at home or when traveling i recommend the sony an lp1 active antenna in addition to the sangean ant 60 mentioned above the an lp1 is powered by two aa batteries folds neatly and fits into a convenient storage bag while it is for indoor use only it mounts in a window or outdoor use only on days on which there is no wind blowing it is an extremely useful addition to the owner s armamentarium n nif you wish to purchase one it sells for about 115 00 including the shipping there is an advantage and a disadvantage and they are both the same currently this antenna is being sold only by an eb y dealer in japan just google buyfromjapan and then enter an lp1 in his search box but he is absolutely reliable and fast you ll have your antenna in less than a week by express mail and he takes the usual major credit cards as well as paypal n ni believe that using an an lp1 with an icf sw7600gr results in an almost perfect portable

4;36;64;0.8592227756801091;the sony icf 7600gr is a great little shortwave radio read the instruction manual operation of this radio is easy but not intuitive i it is much easier to operate than my sony sw77 and it is easier to tune in ssb than the sw77 n sony is the last of the giant manufacturers to offer a shortwave radio and it is still made in japan not china and i thank them for continuing to make a product that only appeals to a small niche of customers n that being said first of all it is not a boom box designed for music listening the fm reception is adequate it is a small radio with a tiny speaker that reproduces the vocal range 200hz 5000hz with clarity without causing fatigue to the listener the sound quality is ideal for shortwave listening swl headphones sound great and receive fm in stereo with high fidelity am mw reception is great if you are looking to primarily listen to music it is the wrong radio for you this radio is primarily designed for swl i will not gripe about a couple of features that this radio is missing since it does an outstanding job without them n the 7600gr tunes sw in 5khz or 1khz steps allowing for fine tuning it has synchronous detection available to lock in weak stations that suffer from fading or interference from adjacent channels it also comes with a wire antenna extension which greatly improves reception of distant signals the 7600gr has a variable antenna attenuator that is far more useful than a dx local switch n i have some hints for beginners first of all when you scan frequencies by meter band make use of the attenuator select a meter band and then manually find a dead channel frequency then adjust the attenuator until you find the threshold of the tune icon in the upper left of the display when the tune icon comes on from background static back off until it disappears and then hit the scan arrow button by doing this it will bypass dead channels and only stop on channels with active broadcasting keep the radio and antenna extension wire near a window and away from flourescent lights light dimmers tv s computers and other electrical devices for best reception for serous listening with an indoor antenna buy an active loop antenna and hang it in the window kaito makes one i am using the sony an lp1 active loop which is excellent but discontinued and still available on the internet the loop is a major improvement over the wire extension it reduces background noise and static and you will not get any better reception unless you use an outdoor antenna swl is better after dark due to atmospheric conditions and the broadcaster scheduling for times that they know listeners are home most countries have at least an hour or two of english speaking broadcasts every day when you listen to am mw keep in mind that the built in ferrite core antenna is bi directional and rotating the radio position can improve reception and reduce background noise n i would highly recommend the icf 7600gr to anyone that wants a highly effective receiver for shortwave you can nit pick when comparing to other sw portables but you will not find any noticeable improvement unless you spend 500 00 for an eton e1xm n nregards jj

9;31;10;0.8092272875583711;my main reason for ordering the 7600gr vs the tecsun pl 660 or pl 880 came down to sony s consistent high quality and numerous reports of quality issues with the tecsun models this radio may not be as feature rich or ergonomically comfortable as others but it has a consistent reputation for being reliable and bullet proof i m not willing to spend over 100 for something that has frequent reports of buggy firmware and of failing after 6 months or 2 years n ni cut my swl teeth on 1950 s era real radios that glow in the dark in later decades i graduated to the excellent general coverage receiver built into my ham transceiver so i ve always taken continuous coverage of the mw and sw bands as a given i m used to options like variable filters but operating the sony 7600 is a very different experience n nthe 7600gr is a great radio every bit deserving of it s sterling reputation but its a lean featured portable not a full service desktop rig there are design compromises dictated by its low price point and intended use if your interests lie in cruising world band am stations carrying the radio in your luggage or dxing from a picnic table in the park and in getting reliable quality for under 200 this may be the radio for you but if you really want to explore all the nooks and crannies of the spectrum chase pirates utilities and number stations and dig into the ham bands i do n t think this radio will pass muster i d suggest you spend a few hundred dollars more for a desktop or sdr rig if your budget can stand it there are good new products in the 450 700 range or go to the used market n nwhat do n t i like about the 7600 there s no tuning knob you tune in incremental steps which does n t work too well except for broadcasters hams and pirates do n t pick frequencies in neat 5 khz steps the coverage is n t continuous there a gaps such as the entire 20 meter ham band tuning ssb signals is touchyt the audio quality is okay but certainly not great even even on fm or when using headphones n nthere are constraints on external antenna options there s an external antenna jack but sony says you should only use it for their optional and expensive active loop antenna because the jack puts a dc voltage on the antenna other antennas such as the included roll up wire antenna clip to the end of the built in whip mw reception is good enough and the internal loopstick is directional which is what you want for mw dxing but any additional mw antenna would have to be inductively coupled not directly connected to the radio this is n t unusual for loop antennas but it would be nice to have the full range of options n na few other thoughts n n1 expect a learning curve read the instructions n2 if you have n t take time to read up on radio propagation it s a complex topic make sure your expectations are realistic n3 how well your receiver works depends just as much on your antenna system as it does on the radio itself you do n t have to spend lots of money a few feet of wire can make a big difference over a built in whip n4 for many of us interference from household stuff like computers tvs wall chargers and power supplies and power lines themselves can create major problems this rfi radio frequency interference has gotten much worse in recent years an outdoor antenna or a directional antenna like a loop may help null out a lot of the rfi you can build your own or buy active antennas may or may not help much and they re expensive n5 the only truly quiet power source is batteries using a plug in wall supply may let in rfi noise from the power lines nearby appliances and possibly from the wall supply itself if you must have one make sure it s not a switching type supply but a regulated design n nabove all have fun
10;98;33;0.7985900452190533;do n t buy this unless you want world band radio in spades this receiver is the best i ve owned in the portable variety i ve had my fill of multiple brands looking for stability sensitivity and selectivity i hear some noise inside the home but once outside in the clear it does it all the noise was due to my many appliances tv being the worst offender once tuned it locks in and the small speaker sounds large plus hams and ability to switch from usb to lsb is amazingly easy to tune it s also very friendly to program search and scan abilities and then store all is commendable the ease of operation amazes me much better than its sangean counterpart the sangean is not nearly as sensitive or user friendly i m happy with this little radio the included case and reel antenna makes it the best deal out there just buy it you wo n t be disappointed international broadcasts are now a nightly affair the fm stereo and am reception is great i also wear headphones at night not included to not keep the wife awake it s the real deal just do it
11;77;20;0.7920425131132006;get this one while it s still available in the us market it s the last of the line of superior sony shortwave radios made in japan solid craftsmanship nand performance yes the audio is subpar from the speaker but jack the 7600gr thru some good speakers and be amazed i just got the radio so have not had time to run it thru the paces on the sw bands but a quick run thru tells me i will get good service out of this one i have been buying and listening to radios for over 46 years so when i say i m impressed by a radio and think enough to write a review take my word for it the 7600gr is that good do n t loose the manual you will need it in closing it s sad that sony has given up on the shortwave radio market guess we leave it to china now good luck with that
12;6;7;0.7230122684079383;i bought this radio after trying out several grundig portables including the yb400 the grundigs were all cheaply made and have less than desirable reception nfurthermore i bought the an lp1 loop antenna made by sony this must be the perfect set up for someone that does not want to pay loads of money but still wants a very satisfying swl experience i love mine and would recommend it to anyone especially if you travel alot like me for you business portable and powerful nfinally you will be suprised how easy it is to learn and operate most of the buttons i figured out without the user manual however there are a few nifty items i found in the user manual so do n t forget to read it
13;38;2;0.7181706969687992;i have just recently gotten into shortwave listening and this radio has been perfect for me i received a grundig yb300 for christmas but upgraded to this model shortly thereafter i have been very happy ever since nthe sony sw7600gr has wonderful reception i have hooked up an outdoor wire antenna also which helps greatly with more faint reception the built in attenuator is very handy for cutting down the signal on strong stations and can be shut off entirely for weeker station reception i love the 100 station presets too which is really all one needs for shortwave listening the sound is ok but with headphones is superb i have also hooked the receiver up to my stereo via the line out jack and this too sounds superb nthe dual clocks are handy and i also use the radio as an alarm clock to wake up to the radio in the morning when using this feature the radio automatically goes into sleep mode and will shut off by itself even if you forget to do so i have had the radio for a month and half so far and the 4 aa batteries are still going strong very good on battery usage i also purchased the ac adaptor but really only use it for fm listening because it adds an internal hum to am reception which is the only negative noverall i could n t be happier with a introductory shortwave am fm radio it s a great value for the money
14;1;6;0.713526674091003;i am fairly new to sw radios i bought a grunding s350 and was annoyed with the drift i would tune into a station and it would slowly tune out i returned it and bought a grunding yb400pe it was much better that s350 but the ssb performance was dismal also i just could not lock on to some weak signals or to a station that was very close to a more powerful station n i went in for the sony 7600gr and have been very happy the synchronous detection helps a lot you can select between lsb and usb when doing synchronous detection this helps you with those pesky neighbouring stations if it is on the lower freq choose usb and vice versa n the audio quality is a little inferior to the yb400 it also does not have a handy snooze button but i am yet to meet a person who buys sw radios for audio quality or as an alarm clock n the yb400 comes with a ac mains power adapter but the sony does not the reel antenna is included in both n if you are looking for a radio that can tune into weak signals provide ssb functionality synchronous detection variable attenuation to drown out noisy interference then this is the adio for you a keeper
15;101;35;0.7084707112988035;it s ok but i m disappointed in the sw performance which was my reason for selecting this model the search feature is subpar in my view if i had it all to do over i would select a model that used the old method of sliding dial selection the digital scan method used here is veg and does not lock on very well so the result is not many stations are picked up the fm performance meets all requirements it locks in and the sound using phones is surperb ditto the local am selection no problem here it s only the sw operation that in my view is lacking
16;30;15;0.5869172887241735;amazon must have a defective batch i bought my first unit in december 2015 the fm reception was distorted it seems the radio was off frequency for example 95 7 came in clearer at 95 6 than 95 7 my other radios had no problem picking up this station at the same location at the correct frequency i exchanged the radio for a replacement this one is also going back as it has the same issue

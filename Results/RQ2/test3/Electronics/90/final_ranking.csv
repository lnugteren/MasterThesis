0;39;21;0.9039170385004384;after reading some of these reviews on the pr d5 i have to wonder whether they are talking about the same product this is a fantastic radio great value for the money simple to operate and has great sound from its stereo speakers sound that rivals way more expensive radios there are no bass and treble adjustments on this radio but i find it is not needed the balance is just right for me the quality of the stereo sound is wonderful and rivals the sound from more expensive stereo systems remember this is a portable unit not a house hi fi system n ni saw a review that said there were no am stations that could be heard there are three inputs with this radio that can be selected using the push button labeled step band in the front 1 fm 2 am 3 auxiliary you can plug your iphone ipad etc in and play it through the radio if the input was at the aux position then there would n t be any am stations playing the reviewer should carefully check to ensure that they did n t accidentally select the aux position n nthe pr de pulls in fm stations very clearly in case you are picking up a weak fm station station is far away from you there is a stereo mono switch on the side of the radio selecting the mono setting will eliminate the hiss on weak stations very nice feature so far i have n t had to extend the fm antenna the stations i listen to were all coming in loud and clear the pr d5 is superior in picking up fm compared to the rest of the many radios i own n nthe am ferrite antenna is built into the set it does n t use the telescoping antenna for am just lay the radio flat and turn it to get the best sound the sangean pr d5 has a 200 mm ferrite bar which is larger than the average radio has this results in superior am performance one reviewer mentioned that they do n t hear many stations during the daytime that is the way am propagation works during the daytime you will hear local am stations well the am band comes alive in the evening and you can hear stations from hundreds or more miles away the local stations reduce their power which also allows you to hear the other less powerful stations which are now in the clear not hearing am stations in the daytime is not a radio problem it s the way the am band works n ni travel between upstate ny and washington dc and i love to listen to 880 am wcbs new york station in the evening it comes in load and clear from about 300 miles away many other dx distance stations can be heard throughout the am band during the evening hours this radio does a great job in picking them up because it s a portable the pr d5 can be rotated to get the best sound on am if this was a bigger tabletop radio that would not be so easy or feasible to do it s a portable but the sound is comparable to a big tabletop radio rich tones and great stereo from the two built in speakers to test this out find a classical music fm stereo station and listen yourself it s a beautiful sound for just a 60 radio n nsetting the time on the built in clock is very simple to do the easiest way is to tune to a fm station that is broadcasting in rds radio data system you can tell because the display will have text scrolling about the radio station that is currently selected once a rds fm station is playing then press and hold the ct display button on the front of the radio for two seconds and it will update the time from the radio station could n t be easier you can also set in manually by pressing and holding the tuning knob for 2 sections when doing this the hour display will blink and you can turn the tuning knob to advance the hours press the tuning knob one more time and you can adjust the minutes press it again to exit out n nonce the clock time is set you can set the alarm to wake to music you can also set the radio to turn off after playing for a set time sleep mode once the clock is set it continues to display you can see the time display if there is any light in the room you can also press the ct display button to have the display line lighted for about 10 seconds not having the display lit all the time is not a problem that would unnecessarily drain the battery and is not really needed with any ambient light in the room the display can be read just fine n nthe sangean pr d5 takes 6 c type batteries or you can use the included wall plug if you use alkaline batteries they will last a very long time the manual says 70 hours of play i have gone several months without having to change the battery i also purchased a 12 pack of c alkaline batteries for about a dollar a piece total of 12 if the batteries last 3 months then that is about 13 cents a day for the added advantage of being ready for a power outage and the flexibility of easily moving the radio from room to room at will without needing to unplug and replug the wall power supply you can also use rechargeable batteries which work fine but are not as powerful and will not last as long as alkalines the rechargeable c type batteries are not cheap plus you need to also purchase a recharger and recharge the batteries which can take several hours depending on your charger i prefer to just buy the alkalines since they last over three months n nthe pr d5 does not have a carrying handle but i do n t see that as a problem the radio even with the 6 c batteries loaded is not that heavy and you can easily pick it up to move it from room to room n nif you are in the market for a portable am fm radio and you are looking for a well made constructed affordable radio that delivers on quality sound picks up fm and am stations from hundreds of miles away and does it well then for 60 this is a no brainer great radio
1;81;49;0.8951047055835348;bought this for our bathroom radio no electricity do n t ask n nsound very good solid the sound leans more to the bass than i would have guessed i listen mainly to public radio so the bass helps with the voices with my prior radio i turned the bass way up and the treble down my kids listen to contemporary pop so again bass is good n nthe player has a stereo mono switch i could n t hear much difference between the two which was good and bad a little stereo separation may have been nice but practically difficult given the size and speaker placement on the other hand i notice a big difference between stereo and mono on our regular stereo receiver so much so that i always need to switch it to mono to cut down on the fuzz sound here no fuzz n nreception so far rock solid our prior radio a great rca model had some problems with reception but the stations here came in spot on i m using the antennae fully extended against an inside wall n nsize most surprising the player is much smaller than i had guessed it is a bit narrow so that freestanding i suspect it may be a bit tippy there are four rubber pads on the bottom there is no handle or loops for a strap a ridge extends on the back side just below the cut out for the antennae if you put your hand over the top with your fingers under the ridge your thumb can control the buttons of the front easily n nthe tuner and volume are on the right side i suspect that confusing the two will be common with the tendency to reach for the top button tuner to control the volume the buttons adjust the volume nicely no clicks just smooth control n nthe body is completely plastic but feels like good quality the speakers are set back slightly from the covering grill presumably to avoid damage n nset up tuning the stations in to the presets is easy there are only five presets no second level for another set of five presets this is ok but it would have been nice to have two levels we often use the two levels in other equipment to differentiate between kids and adult stations n nthe sleep function will be nice in case we walk out and forget to turn off the radio have n t used the alarm the lcd panel light up but then shuts off to preserve battery life i presume there s a clock there s the obligatory external auxiliary device a k a ipod plug in on the right side as well n nthere is no weather radio which is a disappointment how difficult would it have been to add that in n npower six c cell batteries i guess the c size was a compromise d s would have been too heavy and aa two light still c sizes are harder to find especially in rechargeables still if this player is anything like the rca the batteries may last years also there s a plug in on the right side for ac power and a wall wart comes with the unit not used by me see above n nhated to see our old radio die after twenty plus years but this will be a great replacement n noctober 2011 battery life is short my first set of five c cell batteries lasted about 40 hours my guess is that the display drains the batteries as radios themselves do n t generally suck much power our old radio no display used to last years on a set of batteries replaced with rechargeables and am getting just a little less play time be warned n nother than that we love this radio sound is great for the entire family i particularly like listening to public radio programs n none unexpected use was the auxiliary plug in my kids plug their mp3 players in while taking a shower and i use for podcasts i do n t know if this use drains the battery more or not n njune 2013 still going strong batteries rechargeable last about three weeks in our house four people in the bathroom mainly radio listening probably about an hour a day
2;16;86;0.879424850385332;i fully agree with nearly all the comments offered on this radio having received one as an expected gift at christmas first a couple of neutral or negative comments the radio is just like the picture shows it not everyone s idea of a portable radio a la the worn out but more conventionally packaged grundig yachtboy 400 that this radio replaced but as indicated below i think the positives way outweigh any negatives and in person i find it a very nice package also the user s manual leaves something to be desired without going into details about all such minutia the way that the clock can be set while the radio is on requires you enter the clock set mode first not explained in manual and the capturing of the correct time from the rds signal took some experimenting to get to work correctly ca n t absolutely state this with assurance but some rds signals do n t seem to have the clock setting signal and i have one station that seems to set the internal radio clock inaccurately but i have located one local rds station that reliably can set the clock now for the positives the sound is excellent for a radio this size the speakers though small seem to be of excellent quality and can if required fill a large room with pleasant sound at close range say 2 feet away the stereo effect on fm is very natural and pleasant on the am side i find the selectivity and particularly sensitivity to be the best of any small radio i ve ever seen last night from falls church va i received koa in denver the first time in a long time that i have been able to pull it from the loads of co channel interference all the original clear channels wsm wmaq wlw wor wgn canada wjr wabc wbbm wgy wcco whas and on up the dial were received in excellent fashion some of the nearer ones sounding like locals i will use this radio mostly while travelling and am looking to a long and pleasant assoication
3;7;2;0.8701984182481763;i moved into a new home and could not pull in decent am fm radio not even with a yagi antenna that worked well in a former residence despite the fact that most of my radios and receivers have digital pll tuners stations from various geographical areas fight with each other for the same frequency not only on am but fm radio and not only at night but even in the middle of the day reception was so bad that most of my radios even when run on battery power to eliminate the electrical as a source of interference could not pull in more than one or two nearby am fm stations on the flip side sometimes the radios i had on hand received stations hundreds of miles north or south of me on am but not the ones located in my own area hence my use of the bermuda triangle of am fm radio in my review title n ni listen to a well known nightly talk show that broadcasts on a 50 000 watt am station that can be heard outside of the state where i live but in my current home it was entirely usurped on all but two of my radios an ancient ihome ipod clock radio and a bose wave radio with only the bose holding the station with any reliability buying another radio was a must if i was to listen live to my daily program do n t ask me why but i much prefer live radio over podcasts iheart radio and the like n nafter searching the web i came across a blogger who does nothing but review all manner of am fm radio he said that the sangean pr d5 was a bargain that had flown under the wire for many radio enthusiasts he rated it 4 5 stars so i jumped on amazon and ordered the pr d5 n nthis purchase is only my second for the sangean brand the first was a shower radio with a mono speaker reviewed elsewhere on amazon my sangean shower radio developed finicky buttons after a couple of years of use such that attempting to change volume will instead change the station this too was among the radios in my new home that ca n t grab and hold am fm stations reliably meaning next to nill however after reading the review of this model and appreciating that the am antenna is 200mm which is about as generous as they come i took the plunge n nimpression n n4 5 stars does what i need and pulls in and more importantly holds the desired am fm frequency this alone makes it well worth the cost for those of us who live in areas where reception is particularly challenging that s not to say i now have a perfect am listening experience however i still experience am drift at night however it does n t lose my station entirely to fade out which is a significant achievement considering how many radios could not even tune the frequency to begin with n n1 star audio sounds as if it is muffled by a thin pillow especially on am whether on am or fm the sound quality is not much improved over my mono speaker sangean shower radio this is disappointing because i was really excited to order a stereo radio given the fact that so many radios i own are unusable in my location moreover it s also becoming harder to find anything in this size or smaller in a stereo two speaker design one of the great mysteries of the universe is why manufacturers are selling internet and hd radios even paired to a monaural speaker is this 1954 but i digress n n3 stars the controls are not as intuitive as i expected considering how straightforward the layout per the product images i am accustomed to picking things up and being able to program and set the time on the spot with this radio i had to consult the user guide to set the clock and even to operate functions that i had in fact attempted to do correctly as an example i tried to set the station presets as i do on my other sangean by holding in the button for a couple of seconds to save the station but instead the radio responded as if i had selected an existing factory preset i then consulted the user manual thinking i had been wrong about how to go about setting presets turns out i had to apply more force to the button to trigger the preset memory another thing i do n t care for is that the sleep button shares its function with the on off button as a result i had a similar experience in attempt to set the sleep timer i held the button in to trigger the sleep function but all i kept getting was 60 minutes the default again i had to consult the user manual to confirm that there were other increments to choose from and how to cycle through them because some button functions are shared and or are very specific about the level of pressure they require to operate and because my sangean shower radio apparently was n t the exception for having buttons malfunction per other amazon reviews i fear the longevity of the use of the sleep button which is a must have feature for my needs may be limited on the plus side i do like the ease with which it is possible to change volume and frequency as compared to my sangean shower radio the rotary knobs make it quick to change the station or the volume an improvement i think over having to repeatedly hit an up or down button as is the case with the shower radio n n4 stars i like that this radio comes with the ac adapter a trend i noticed while shopping for a radio is that manufacturers are increasingly leaving the adapters out as a secondary separate purchase not so with this radio although i intend to operate the pr d5 mostly on the c batteries it s nice to know that i can plug it in to an electrical outlet that said there is a note included with the product stating that because of fcc energy efficiency requirements for ac adapters that the adapter may cause interference to the am band n n3 stars the form factor of this radio is attractive i bought the silver white version that said there is no carrying handle and when the c batteries are inserted it becomes a bit difficult to use because the unit becomes somewhat heavy the surface is slick so my concern is that it will eventually be dropped n nconclusion n ni rate the pr d5 three stars overall is because the audio quality is a let down on the am band at night the sound becomes a bit muddier meaning even less treble which does n t help fm stereo is better but not particularly enjoyable in fairness however i am spoiled by a harman kardon audio receiver paired to klipsch speakers a bose wave radio and the sony xdr f1hd the latter of which has somewhat of a cult following so i may be pickier than most although i m far from a true audiophile n nthe drawback to this model much like the sangean shower radio i own is that the factory set eq is not optimized for talk radio in the least i find this especially odd when you consider that the top selling point of the pr d5 is the exceptional am sensitivity because i purchased this radio mostly for am reception it s disappointing to have to turn the volume up louder than i might otherwise if the audio were optimized for talk in particular this is not ideal for nighttime listening when you might prefer more treble to improve talk radio audio in lieu of a volume boost as a workaround i hooked my pr d5 to external speakers only to find the sound was largely unimproved if i had to guess the circuitry s main emphasis is to minimizing the intrusiveness of interference where present so that hiss static are not accentuated the way it is on radios with full range sound hence the audio quality trade offs n nif i had to do it all over again and since i m still within the return period i just might i d pay more and spring for the sangean pr d15 also sold here on amazon which adds bass treble controls the option to run off of rechargeable batteries and notably a carrying handle in short i m still on the fence as to whether or not this particular model is a keeper
4;59;33;0.8623219200322245;when i am interested in buying a new product i read the reviews to find out what other people think of the product in this case the product is the sangean pr d5 am fm portable radio a problem in doing this is how much credence to give to the reviews some of the comments about the pr d5 show a lack of understanding on how radios work and on how radio waves are propagated the performance of a radio should be evaluated during daylight hours when propagation conditions are very stable and not at night when propagation conditions are very unstable some reviewers blamed the unstable performance at night to the radio rather than the propagation conditions n nthe external whip antenna is for fm reception only adjusting this antenna may improve the fm reception the am antenna is inside the radio and rotating the radio may improve am reception some of the reviewers seemed to be unaware of this judging from their comments the manual could be more helpful in this area n nwhat do i think of the pr d5 it is a remarkably good am fm radio sensitivity is excellent on both am and fm the am band on all radios is susceptible to interference from computers microwave ovens calculators telephones and any number of electrical devices the more sensitive the radio the more susceptible it is to this type of interference one reviewer thought his old radio was better than the pr d5 because the old radio was less susceptible to interference less sensitive and therefore better n nthe audio quality is outstanding on both am and fm some of the older reviews say that there is too much bass in the am band and it is difficult to understand speech that might have been the case in earlier production units but it is not true in the one i have it is not unusual for manufacturers to continue making improvements after they have been selling the product for some time n ni have been interested in electronics for over 50 years i have owned portable radios costing 500 and table model radios costing almost 2 000 as far as i am concerned the sangean pr d5 is the most cost effective radio that i ever purchased the best performer per dollar
5;30;83;0.8514686364948609;i purchased this item on line here and recieved it within 4 days unfortunately the unit had a defective ac power adaptor after plugging the unit in the power kept dis connecting further examination determined the problem to be in the connecting jack of the 9volt adaptor likely a loose wire at the jack as just moving the wire slightly disconnected the power unfortunately i had to return the whole unit rather than just the adaptor n nwithin a 10 days a new unit arrived and i am quite happy with the radio nthe sound quality is very good with a rich sound that makes music especially enjoyable a slight dis advantage is the lack of tone control or bass treble controls again considering the 2 relatively small speakers the sound quality is quite amazing but if you prefer deeper bass or higher treble you may be disappointed n nas for reception of radio stations i have found it to be quite sensitive i receive all local or near local high power fm stations bangor ellsworth mid coast and downeast maine all within 50 miles in full stereo with the antenna fully extended also take note there are no external jacks for am or fm antennas so if you are in extreme fringe am or fm areas this may not be a good set for you there is a stereo mono fm switch for improved reception of weaker stations at 175 miles i can receive whom mount washington nh in mono but stereo is quite noisy nas for the rds surprisingly only 2 local stations have it and it is quite useful in identifying the songs played i expected more stations to utilize the feature but it was not my primary reason for buying this set n non am i was pleased to receive many high power boston am stations 200 miles away across open water my local 5 000 watt am station 20 miles away comes in perfectly note also on am that the set is quite directional so proper orientation is a factor especially if am is your primary listening choice there seems to be a very sensitive ferrite rod am antenna mounted internally beneath the fm antenna i do find it is quite sensitive to computer generated noise so if your computer is anywhere near the radio expect poor reception of weaker stations nnight time reception of am can be quite impressive and this could be a good receiver for those who enjoy long distance night time dx reception n nthe timer alarm function is very convenient to use and it makes a great radio for dozing off to at night and or waking up battery use appears to be reasonable although i have yet to use a full set of batteries on it 6 c cells having the battery level indicator is a nice feature n none other added bonus is the aux input for plugging in a cd player or other device n nfor the price i find this to be a great little radio my only other minor grudge is that it does not have a handle although it is lightweight and fairly portable it just does n t lend itself for a lot of mobility n nagain for the price i find this a good bargain
6;61;14;0.8327622286873403;perfect in every way every aspect of this machine has been intelligently engineered to be simple yet exacting take the digital tuner accessed by the tuning knob on the side rolls to let you tune like an old fashioned analog radio but with soft little clicks to tell you each 0 1 increment of frequency change you re making and the display that shows exactly what frequency to which you re tuning two high quality speakers deliver bose like sound having had bose radios before i can assure you the sound is full resonant nontinny like a bose yet never thumpy or causing the radio to vibrate like some of the cheaper digital boombox i ve used in the past http www amazon com creative d80 wireless bluetooth speaker dp b004x28i0a a 3 5 mm line input lets you effortlessly hook up your mp3 player to the radio and best of all again unlike the aforementioned cheaper boombox the volume knob does indeed actually modulate the volume of the mp3 input the up to the minute rds radio data system display scrolls whatever outgoing data accompanies the radio signal like the name of the artist and the name of the song for fm music stations then unobtrusively shifts back into showing the time when you turn the radio off pre sets make it easy to tune five favorite fm stations and five am stations the ac power supply ensures you wo n t have to add this radio to the growing list of electronic gadgets that constantly need to be charged yet it also accepts 6 old school c batteries if you want to take it to the beach the 10 inch wide by 5 and a half inch high size plus leave a little room for the unobtrusive but effective antenna that picks up even low signal strength college stations without having to even be extended makes it a perfect size for a 12 inch high bookshelf or pretty much anywhere the brief instruction manual is carefully written and in intelligent english finally the white color is cheerful and brightening i like this radio so much i got one for the bathroom one for the kitchen table and one for the physical therapy gym where i work where by labeling it this radio is from the rehab department of a nursing home i hope to shame any prospective thief from taking it
7;6;3;0.8255333976494694;i bought this in november 2017 to finally replace my ge superadio iii that i ve had for over 10 years telescoping antenna accidentally broke i live almost 50 miles from nyc so to get nyc radio stations requires a very strong radio and the ge worked great its drawback was the analog dial which was inaccurate to say the least n ni compared various models from c crane and sangean and decided on the sangean pr d5 i do n t need shortwave or weather bands and i wanted a digital tuner but i do n t need anything else this radio sits by my home office desk and i listen to it while working worked great for 4 weeks then stopped cold in the middle of the day granted i had n t paid much attention to the screen so i probably missed the low battery indicator was just a pwr on the screen and no buttons worked the only way to reset this thing is to take the old batteries out wait 3 5 full minutes until the pwr is gone from the screen then put new batteries in in contrast the superadio iii would begin to fade when batteries were about to die but it would respond instantly when new batteries were installed during the 5 minutes without battery or ac the sangean does maintain your radio station settings but apparently not the clock not important to me since i have clocks around me but could be an issue for someone else n nthe radio performs well no station drift and picks up am and fm stations as well as the ge but the battery swap procedure taking 3 5 minutes for no good reason cost this radio one star in my rating
8;10;12;0.8165573463938804;i m not an engineer but i am an avid radio listener which is becoming an endangered species i wanted a good looking small radio for our remodeled bathroom so i can listen to music and npr while i get ready the look of this is very modern and has nice clean lines but it had to have good sound eliminating all the cheap small radios as an option i have two bose radios in other places in my house so that s what i would compare this to the sound is amazing out of those two little speakers almost better than my bose radio also the reception is way better than the bose which does n t have a dedicated antenna you can see in the picture that i have the antenna extended a bit i put the antenna down and tucked it away which improved the look and did n t degrade the reception n nthe preset buttons are very easy to program and i love the volume knob on the side which is easy to turn n nif this radio had a rechargeable built in battery like my bluetooth speakers that would make it completely perfect otherwise it s almost completely perfect n nnote the picture looks black and white but it s not our bathroom is white and grey
9;28;11;0.7499882147766828;the radio that i received is not the same as the one i ordered as seen in the picture i ordered a white radio and the one i received is a transparent one to make things worse it does not have an alarm button it is blocked and there is no title on top of the button see picture it does not have an aux in input either so i can not listen to music from my mobile phone it is blocked see picture i already own a sangean pr d5 radio and i was very happy with it which is why i purchased a second one that s how i know that the button is missing the picture and the description do not match the radio i received the model seen in the image is not the one i received it is transparent has no alarm button and no aux in input
10;42;9;0.6946462958622198;i did a lot of online shopping and it paid off with this very fine little portable first i wondered about the price but further checking told me it was a better portable with c batteries than most controls are simple and pretty neat for ole man and two speakers are very good for size i like more base not much treble so it suits me well some may want a choice switch reception is excellent usually without extending the antenna very high c batts play a looong time copper tops i stopped counting at 26 hrs and have n t run them down yet low to med volume no top foldable handle is fine for me they can break or get in the way it s small enough to grasp by the ridge on the back some want the digital readout to stay lit but i think that s a battery saver feature maybe a choice of backlight on fulltime would be nice i usually can read it without the backlight on especially in dark room of course more options more nmost important it s a well built user friendly compact two speaker portable with long battery life and very handy for moving around nvery happy with features and the sound with a reasonable size and weight

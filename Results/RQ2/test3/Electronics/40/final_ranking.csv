0;39;24;0.6552703547935339;i bought this recorder because i needed the shoe box size to give to a friend in mexico i thought since it was a panasonic it would be very nice it was perfect except there is no tone adjustment and the quality of sound is tinny
1;24;25;0.6070028830833273;i purchased the panasonic shoe box recorder for my wife she plays the organ and likes to listen to her pratice sessions for improvement at first the sound quality was n t good enough but i bought a external mic at radio shack for 10 00 and now the sound is very good a big improvement i purchased a universal cassette mic 3303019 from my local radio shack n nbest of all she likes it
2;31;28;0.5822742682116963;i am very pleased with this recorder it is easy to operate and does a very good job as a recorder there is just one problem when recording with the built in microphone it picks up the motor noise this can be overcome by using a plug in mike and placing the recorder a safe distance away
3;22;6;0.554364415381535;the buttons on this recorder stick and are hard to use i can not record on it without trying to push record and play several times to get them to stay down forget about trying to pause while recording it simply wo n t do it it quite frankly is a piece of cheap garbage

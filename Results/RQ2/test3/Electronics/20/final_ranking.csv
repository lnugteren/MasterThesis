0;12;16;0.6813139627784984;i frankly did n t think that this product would work in my house in that the wiring is very old as is the phone line but it was easy to setup and worked right away even though i have a 56k modem i was never able to connect faster than 36 bps with the wireless i m getting connected between 26 4 bps and 33 bps i m happy with it still waiting for the day broadband comes to my neighborhood though
1;17;18;0.6757027287930049;had a small setup problem i needed to do the security setup before it would let me hear a dialtone otherwise i use it on my tivo and it works just fine so far nupdate several years later this unit is really lousy i called tivo for an unrelated issue one day and the guy on the phone said you re using one of those wireless modem things are n t you he could tell because my dialup pattern was an abbatoir i did n t know because the tivo managed to mask the failures but after trying several online tivo updates i got to finding out how much this really does n t work i have a series 2 tivo now and am using an 802 11 network which is infinitely better and faster
2;13;13;0.6433174407652238;this product will reduce the connection sound quality in any and all circumstances but may also be a useful compromise if you have decided not to add a new telephone jack even though you could probably use one you may want to get this the wireless modem jacks are superior to the less expensive wireless phone jacks they provide better sound quality and faster data rates i know this from experience the modulation of the telephone signal into a radio signal is the source of the quality loss i have also read that nearby ham radios may experience some interference nall in all i m glad that i have one but the outrageous prices that are charged for this very simple device prevent me from giving it more than two stars this price is bad enough
3;11;9;0.5567586430025372;i have a limited number of phone jacks in my home and the rc930 helps out alot without it i would have phone line strung everywhere i use the rc930 for internet access for my computer upstairs i usually connect between 33 2 and 34 6 kbps with the units about 15 feet apart i have had fluctuations in the speed from 19 2 37 4 kbps depending on what i have operating at the time it s a little slow but not bad for surfing the web or playing some online games i would n t recommend it if you download large files and i keep a long phone cord for those purposes if you do n t mind phone cord all over the place then i d recommend just purchasing the extra phone cord however if you d like an alternative then the rc930 works fine the price is way too high for what it s worth though this is why i only give it 3 stars
4;14;14;0.4068123363367349;i was n t sure if this would work but it works great base unit is upstairs and the extension jack is downstairs my tivo another great product uses it to call out every night w o fail

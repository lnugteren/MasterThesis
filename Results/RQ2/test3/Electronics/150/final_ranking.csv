0;33;32;0.8787445022798753;i ll hold off on technical issues lets start with the physical case itself i m totally pleased with both the fit and finish of this case the color is a snazzy but not garish burnt orange its very nice the new ipad 2012 model fits inside with a snug snap in the corners very nice i feel totally secure having it in here i m very pleased with the hard back cover protection as that s what took a real beating on my last ipad the grip your hands have on the material helps you keep a confident hold the microfiber is plush frankly the case looks and feels a lot more expensive than it is the magnets inside could be a little more powerful you can feel the weakness of it when folding the cover into a stand especially but that s so minor of an issue it s not worth half a star n nso why only three stars the mediocre review star wise is strictly for the auto sleep feature not working properly as promised the iteration of the cover i have does not activate the sleep wake function the manufacturer has noted this and changed the description accordingly i ve seen that the makers want to make it right and i d really like a corrected case please so i promise to update my review accordingly once i have the new version of the case n nagain it s a fine fine case sincerely it s wayyyy more than i had expected and the manufacturer seems to be on top of issues another major plus just bear in mind if you have a new 2012 ipad you may want to hold off on ordering until the makers update things i ll update this review dear shoppers as soon as i ve gotten one of the updated models n n update n na long overdue update my replacement cover arrived a while back and it s been serving full time duty since i stand by all the positives of my original review everything is exactly the same the fit and finish are top notch and now the neato magnets in the cover are in their proper smart positions great functionality i get complements on it all the time and have already steered a few shoppers toward invellop while in some of the big box stores to stop them from making the mistake of buying a sub standard cover
1;34;33;0.8738532207972747;revised on 3 16 12 7 30 pm est n nhave n t had this happen often unfortunately but this company actually surprised me a couple of hours after my original post i received the following email n ndear customer n nwe are pleased to have confirmed that the invellop cases fit the new ipad or ipad 3 properly as it may have come to your attention the sleep awake function sensors have been moved on the new ipad and as a result most of the third party cases will not activate this function the same as on ipad 2 apple does not release information to other companies about their newly developed product therefore neither manufacturers nor distributors were informed of this slight change prior to the release of the new ipad ipad 3 as a curtesy to our valued customers who purchased the invellop cases assuming the sleep awake function will function the same as on the ipad 2 we would like to provide the options n noption 1 we will refund 6 00 per each recently purchased case to compensate for the sleep awake function matter noption 2 customers are welcome to use their case s for two weeks after which we will inform them when the new invellop cases will be produced with correct location of sensors which will be able to activate the sleep awake function on both the ipad 2 and the new ipad ipad 3 upon receipt of an original case back from our customers we will send the new invellop case as replacement noption 3 customers are welcome to return their case s for a full refund n nwe hope you are pleased with the options above as we looking forward to providing for your apple product protection needs in the future also we would like to ask you to postpone on leaving a review on the case s before you will receive the new cover if you have chosen option 2 to avoid negative reviews enjoy your new ipad n nsincerely ninvellop llc n ni chose option 2 and they ve agreed to pay for shipping old case back to them and for shipping new case to me almost as surprising is the speed of response on the email exchange we had n nso assuming the exchange for the new fully ipad3 compatible case goes well i m extremely happy with this case as i said in my original review the thing is gorgeous and offers a fair bit of protection with almost no bulk it wo n t protect your case from a 4 foot drop onto concrete but for the day to day stuff it s perfect and again it looks and feels great assuming the magnets on the new one they send work i ll likely order a second in another color they re that good and at the price point blow away every other case i ve had for previous ipads n n noriginal review n nfirst off cover is gorgeous and exactly the feel and bulk i was looking for no complaints on design at all if you re buying this for an ipad 2 n n which i did n t i purchased it for the ipad3 that was arriving today when i ordered the invellop case 4 days ago the description clearly stated that it was compatible with the new ipad it s not the magnets do n t hold the cover closed and therefore do not activate the auto on feature a disclaimer has now been added by invellop some time over past 24 36 hours but it was fundamentally misleading to advertise this as an ipad 3 case n nsecond issue with invellop is misleading info regarding shipping cost depending on where you look on their storefront the cost for expedited shipping is anywhere from 4 99 to 8 99 i was charged the high end of that range and while 4 is a ridiculously insignificant amount to worry about in the context of an 800 electronics purchase the misleading nature of the shipping policy is what is concerning n ni emailed the company to question both of these issues and received a prompt but surprisingly dismissive response basically the message was you should have waited until after you received your ipad3 before ordering a case not sure how to even respond to that
2;84;83;0.8582480194884587;i highly recommend this case for the ipad i purchased it in advance of the release of the new ipad after the company assured me that if it did n t fit they would give a refund it turns out that it does in fact fit perfectly the case is high quality and looks great best of all the cost is significantly lower than competing products n nit s worth noting that since the case was made for the ipad 2 the version i purchased did not work with the new ipad s automatic cover on off feature it seems that apple moved the magnets around slightly when i contacted the company within minutes they responded offering me a complete refund or the option to keep the current case until they make new ones that activate the on off feature i was very impressed with the customer service n nall in all if you have an ipad 2 this is a great choice for a case if you have the new ipad wait until they ve come out with a new version and you ll be very happy with what you get n nps n ni do n t work for the company i m just pleased to get a quality item at an affordable price
3;58;57;0.8461178825411645;update 1 10 13 ni ve had this case for about 10 months now i am knocking the rating down from 5 star to 3 1 2 stars even though amazon does n t allow 1 2 stars i still like the look of the case however i am a little disappointed in the durability of the case the leatherette has peeled away at the corners exposing the plastic beneath with this protection stripped away the clips that hold the ipad have started to chip i still like the case though i would have liked it to last at least a full year under regular use it s still a good price and a color that you do n t find with other brands just know what you are paying for n noriginal review nthis is a great value as compared to the smart covers issued by apple my 3rd gen ipad snaps in easily and stays in no problem fits like a glove its nice to have a cover on both the front and back the sleep cover issue is now resolved and works great on both my gen3 and my wife s gen2 i am really happy with the quality of my orange cover and the reasonable price
4;13;12;0.8408203649273169;i purchased this case for my 3rd generation ipad i ve been using the case for about 10 days now and i love it the ipad fits perfectly in the case the cover works as a stand in two different positions and it folds all the way back not all cases do i like the gray color it fits in well with my macbook pro i would call it a light gray the magnet is strong enough to keep the cover closed and activate the sleep wake feature i definitely recommend this product if you want a cover similar to the apple smart cover but want to save some money i prefer the invellop case because it covers the back of the ipad and the smart cover does not
5;71;70;0.8399020423807768;i have used this case since the release of the 3rd generation ipad i find that this case is great for its sleekness and feel this case is better than the smartcover that apple sells because of the attached protective case on the back the smartcover is basically a cover without any rear protection to avoid dents and scratches unfortunately i have found that the magnet within the invellop case is not strong enough to turn the device on and off from sleep mode also after bending the cover flap consistently to allow the ipad to stand freely the material on the top and bottom edges of the flap started to wear and peel away after dropping the ipad within this case the digitizer glass front not lcd cracked diagonally along the whole screen after a month of using this case 2 corners that kept the ipad secure within the case broke off it does not do a great job at protecting the product but it allows the ipad to retain its thin and sleek design the material is not that great it does not really hold up after 2 months i wish i had invested in a better case
6;24;23;0.8288463257543751;we initially got the version which fit the ipad 3 perfectly but had sleep wake issue because apple changed the magnet placement the vendor took great steps with many options to get us the new and improved version that works perfectly with the ipad 3 they handled all return shipping and replacement costs a please to work with n nas for the case it is a nice all in one smart case the material looks and feels like leather without that smell it fits snugly and protects it well the ipad 3 can now wake and sleep using the new and improved additional magnet placement n ngot this for my wife and she loves it got the black version it is professional protective and priced well n ni am so glad a went with this instead of the apple smart cover which costs so much more and only protected the front this product does it all seamlessly it can easily be removed from the case as well when i want to put it in our car center mount for watching movies n ngood investment check it out you will be pleased and surprised by the quality i know i was
7;144;143;0.8116988336322984;first off let me just say that i ve loved this case ever since i received it on the same day i got my 3rd gen ipad the stitching seems to be very strong and the soft microfiber material on the inside help protect the ipad perfectly from outside scratches in addition the color is a rust orange and i ve gotten compliments on it since it is not loud and bright its subtle i ve used this case both laying down typing and upright watching a movie the case makes both stances very stable and i ve even been able to type comfortably while it is standing up as well though not adjustable both heights are very comfortable even if i initially knew it did n t have the sleep wake function on the new ipad i think i would ve still bought this case regardless since do n t most of us have unlock passwords on our ipad anyway with respect to the manufacturer s earlier description i m pretty sure they would not have said it had the sleep wake feature unless they truly thought it did i place more blame on apple since most of their earlier smart covers do not work with the new ipad either all in all im happy with the purchase and have no regrets after my intense 2 week researching for a thin attractive durable case
8;12;11;0.8077178383718604;updated review n nso i had this case and my new ipad for roughly two weeks today i accidentaly dropped the ipad from about two feet off the floor this cover cracked in the corner at impact and allowed the ipad to dent this might be good if you want to keep dust away but as a protection device it is completely useless i now have a 2 week old 700 device that is dented thanks to the lack of quality of this product do not buy this cover buy something that will actually protect your expensive tablet i would not like for anybody else to have the same experience that i just had n n n noriginal review n noverall the case looks nice and seems to be high quality however the cover does n t always work as supposed to turn the ipad off depending on the cover s position the ipad will turn on and off while the cover is shut that is really disappointing since it could drain your battery if you are travelling with it in a backback or briefcase where any movement could cause the ipad to turn on
9;17;16;0.796752746289225;this case is perfect as far as i am concerned and the very nice price makes it even more desirable the feel is great in the hand the magnets work very well not only in waking the ipad and putting it to sleep but also holding the triangle well and helping hold the case closed when you flip it around to the back n nthere are no cons i can come up with and i ca n t recommend this enough
10;9;8;0.7782464443621915;love this case i did lots of research before i purchased anything for my new ipad this one had the best reviews both on amazon and you tube i was also considering the apple smart case and several others that are offered here on amazon the quality is great the price is unbeatable good snug fit to the ipad so i do n t have to worry about it coming off the material inside both sides of the case keep the ipad from getting any kind of scratches the magnets put the ipad right to sleep but do n t cause any problems when folded around to the back when the cover is folded into the stand position it is pretty sturdy the leatherette is sleek and looks nice the purple color is very nice as well you wo n t be disappointed by this case
11;10;9;0.7702827644432066;when i bought the ipad 3 i was drawn to the magnetic apple cover i saw in the store it was sleek and the sleep wake feature very cool but i did n t like how expensive it was and how it did n t protect the back after doing a lot of research i decided on this cover and i am really happy with it it is sleek and light and fits the new ipad 3 perfectly it snaps right in and is very secure the sleep wake feature works perfectly and the ipad can be propped up in two different positions i found other similar types of covers but noticed that the cover does not fold back flat behind the ipad this cover does very happy with this cover and it was affordable
12;43;42;0.770249462826942;after reading many review said that the cover wo n t work with the new ipad all i want is just a case for ipad so if the cover wo n t function on off the ipad that ok to me i ordered it on april 27 2012 after a few days i received i put it on my ipad it fits perfectly but a thing that surprise me is the cover can turn on off the new ipad i tried it a few more thine to make sure that it s not just a coincident it really works n ni just want to tell anybody out there who wondered if the cover will work with the new ipad well it works i think they must have updated the cover magnetic function but i do n t know if it still works with the ipad 2
13;29;28;0.7511731669571997;unfortunately the seller must have jumped the gun in order to rack up sales for the ipad3 but the smart cover on and off feature just does n t work at all i am sure this is unintentional but a major inconvenience for all the people that bought the case based on what the seller said now i have to go through the hassle of sending it back
14;74;73;0.7370200549751094;the design is very slim and light weight the leatherette feels nice and high end the ipad clips nicely into the case and protects the back screen and edges the sleep feature works but could use slightly stronger magnets it sometimes wakes the ipad with just a little movement of the front cover regardless this is a super nice case for a great price very nice job invellop
15;14;13;0.6930209731683628;this is exactly what i m looking for smart cover like functions and a back case to protect the back overall this case is just truly amazing for the price you are paying it is sooooo much better that the apple smart cover for many reasong because this case has the smart feature the stand positions and it even protects pretty much the entire ipad definitely recommend
16;8;7;0.6908478581530693;i m a hard customer to impress and i rarely give five star reviews but this case is totally worth it n nright out of the package it snapped on perfectly it holds my new ipad 4 securely and snugly it is an elegant leatherette and looks phenomenal on the black ipad i have i have nothing bad to say about this the magnetic sleep wake function works perfectly as well and compared to the 70 cases i considered this was an excellent value who would pay 60 for an apple smart cover when this one is a fraction of the cost and works the same
17;27;26;0.6539817336403395;this case is amazing for so much less than the apple smart cover you re getting protection for the front and the back this an absolute necessity in a house with children mine has already fallen once on the hardwood floor and was unscathed nthe orange color is nice too i was nervous this was going to be a bright orange but it s more of a rust nto sum it up i m very happy with this purchase
18;7;6;0.605451568097548;i have only had this a few days but it arrived quicker than expected and it fits very well it seems to be very slightly thicker than the original fruit product but otherwise identical i wish amazon carried more colors than the black one for prime shipping it works just like the original product allows a typing position and a stand up face time position no complaints so far other than color we ll see how it holds up over time but it appears to be well made definitely a better value than the fruit company case for less than half the cost n nupdate after 6 months of light use this case is not holding up the edges are fraying and the stand mechanism is sagging overall it is stil ok but i have to remove at least one star because of its quality problems after use n nupdate had to remove all the stars i could this whole thing fell apart very poor workmanship and materials amazon was great about it

52;1.0;5.0;872.0;"Our house is very small - one bedroom with a shared office. We needed all the space we could manage, so I traded in my writing desk for this floating one. While quite time consuming to put together, it looks absolutely gorgeous once installed, and has saved us quite a bit of space; we installed inside the office closet, where it fits comfortably with about 5"" clearance on either side. I've always wanted a ""closet desk"", and the floating feature gives me plenty of leg room, as well as area to store filing cabinets and other storage bins if need be.\n\nThere is a hidden shelf on the bottom in the back that faces the wall - this is where I've hidden my huge surge protector, so only a few of my many cords are visible. There's a small hole in the center bottom so that I can turn the surge protector off if the power goes out (you have to lie on your back on the floor to access it, so it's completely hidden from normal view). The upper shelf is larger than I thought - I was able to fit my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aqueon-17771-Mini-Bow-2-1-2-Desktop-Aquarium/dp/B00404FLME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aqueon 17771 Mini Bow 2-1/2 Desktop Aquarium</a>&nbsp;without it sticking out at all - my betta likes watching me work, and seems to be much happier somewhere where he can see me most of the working day!\n\nBecause I was unable to find the dimensions of the middle cutout area for a computer on any sites, I was unsure my 27"" iMac would fit. It ended up being a perfect fit - see my customer photo. The inner section of this area measures 27"" wide and 20 1/2"" tall, so if you want to be able to tuck your computer into it for more desk space, make sure it fits within these dimensions. If a 27"" iMac fits, I'm pretty sure most desktops should do fine.";A gorgeous, modern-looking space saver. Using it as a closet desk!
0;2.0;1.0;8.0;"The desk is a good size and feels sturdy. Would have given it 5 stars but its missing the wall rack so i have no way to hang it, which defeats the purpose of a ""wall mounted"" desk. Should be advertised as bulky, bookshelf. ***Updated review, I contacted manufacturer, Prepac, and because I purchased it through Amazon Warehouse they will not even process my order for a wall mount rack. So as a wall mounted floating desk, this particular product is terrible and I do HATE it. So much so, that I am willing to take it all apart to ship it back!";Missing wall rack
10;3.0;1.0;152.0;"After seeing pics of the desk with Apple iMacs, I decided to purchase the desk too and it fit great in the largest window in the desk. The desk hangs on a metal bar screwed into your wall... If the front is lifted or bumped on the front by an office chair that goes up and down, you will experience what I did. My new 5k retina 27"" iMac screen was shattered. It is costing me $606 to repair. There needs to be an option that secures the desk to the wall rather than just hanging. I would return if I could. Has anyone else experienced breaking valuables with the desk?";WARNING: this is not a stable desk!
46;4.0;5.0;237.0;---11/25/13----\nAwesome. Loving this desk! It installed pretty easy, directions were clear. For anyone with a desktop, just get a wall mounting shelf and mount it off to the side, then everything is up off the floor. Ill add some pics of my setup later.\n\nDesk is really sturdy, I would recommend having 2 people to hang it.\n\nJust installed last night, Ill update as this gets used.;Loving the saved space with this desk, If you have a Desktop... read this.
39;5.0;5.0;174.0;"I bought this desk on March 10, 2014, I am writing this review on April 27, 2014.\n\nFirst of all, I was only able to hang the desk by attaching it to a single stud.. I wanted the desk centred in the room, I framed the exterior walls 24"" O.C and it so happened the only stud available was in the exact centre.. However, I bought these bad boys http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051IBDKW/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and used them on both sides of the desk, as well as the one lag bolt into the stud. I hung off the rail just to make sure it would hold.\n\nI love this desk.. I can't say too much bad stuff about it really. The only issue is where I use my mouse (on the right side) the finish on the desk has worn down and is now a spotty brown colour. The finish wore right off down to the particle board. When I noticed it was quite disappointing. I've decided I'll have to start using a mouse pad, which I am not very keen on.\n\nIf it wasn't for this major flaw (after only a month and a half of use) I would give this desk 5 stars. But it is really annoying that the finish is already coming off.\n\n-edit-\n\nI contacted Prepac and their customer service was excellent. They have sent a replacement desk top that I have installed already and it looks great. Hopefully this one holds up better. Since nobody else (as far as I can tell) has had this issue, it's possible I got a lemon. I have adjusted my review to 5/5 simply due to the customer support and speedy help they supplied me.";Nice desk, finish doesn't last
45;6.0;4.0;181.0;"I hope that this review will help you make an informed choice when it comes to computer desk.\n\n I gave this desk a four star only based on a couple of reasons. The first is the fact that I actually love the look and design of the desk. The second is that it creates leg room and de-clutters the computer area. If you were to ask me if I would purchase it again, I would say ""yes"".  It is a beautiful and spacious piece.\n\n Now for a little on the concerns for new buyers. Go ahead of time and get your own lag bolts from a ""do it yourself store"". They sent three with the desk and all three broke. But I was prepared because of a review that I had already read. Also the desktop itself had two small spots with chips. One spot is the size and shape of the tip of your fingernail. The other is the corner of the desktop. It appears to just be crumpled a little. I cannot say where the dents/chips came from since the box was open upon arrival. But with that said I am still happy with the desk.  I can live with the dents for the price, look, and feel of the desk.\n\nI would also recommend this desk if you are not easily discouraged. For the purpose it is perfect.";The good, the bad, and the informed.
29;7.0;5.0;138.0;I really like this desk. It opens up the floor underneath my desk and makes it looks so clean. The cords are kept hidden away and tidy. I put mine in a corner where a normal desk makes it seem so dark but this desk brightens it up and is very functional. There is a short horizontal piece behind where you keep the monitor (you can see it in the pictures) and this covers part of the hanging system but I have found it very useful by purchasing peel and stick dry erase board and attaching it so that now it's a mini dry erase area great for little notes and inspirational quotes.;Great function
32;8.0;5.0;120.0;"Did a lot of researching before finally deciding on buying this desk. After reading all the comments I was afraid of getting the wrong color or have missing parts but all my worries disappeared when I opened up the box.  Everything was there and even had extra parts left over.  My small desk I had in my bedroom took up too much room.  Years ago I had purchased a floating shelf and loved it.  I finally found the desk to match.  Looks like they were made for each other.  Put the desk high enough so the arms of my chair fits underneath and if I wanted to stand it wouldn't be too awkward.  Now my whole area is compact but yet have plenty of room for ""stuff"".  I put the desk together by myself and it was kind of hard for me but after several attempts I got it together.  Two people is needed to hang unless you a strong person.  It took a while to get used to the desk because i had the sensation it may fall in my lap.  It's been two weeks now and I am already used to the height.  The only con I have is that the depth of 19"" is almost not enough space for a monitor and keyboard.  But this will only help me to keep the desk clutter free.";Brillant Idea - Great Desk!
57;9.0;4.0;81.0;"Just finished installing it this morning. The instructions were clear, easy to put together, doesn't take any special tools. Anytime something comes with Allen wrenches, I cut them off and use them in my cordless drill. Measure before you install; the lower stabilizer will block outlets. I raised it 1.5"" higher than it said and it's fine.";So far so good
59;10.0;3.0;77.0;It definitely saved space in my room which was the original intent.  The wall mount is a nice touch and makes it look pretty awesome.  You WILL have cables underneath exposed... and also, the instruction manual recommends installing it at a height that conflicts with the height of standard electrical sockets in the US.  Thank god I had someone handy helping me with this, we had to modify and cut the bottom to make the socket accessible.  Also, the main desk piece itself had holes pre-drilled incorrectly, which we were forced to plug and improvise new holes where they SHOULD have been.  Also had minor cosmetic damage from shipping but luckily it was in areas that are not very exposed.  The finished product is definitely nice, but I would've wanted a bit more quality in the end.;While I do like the product...
22;11.0;5.0;50.0;"My fiance and i go to school and deal with a lot of paperwork. We used the laptop on the couch and bed but after a while it got uncomfortable. So we decided to get a desk. After browsing thru a few options we came across this one. Modern look and wall mount, we just finished redecorating and this was exactly the perfect fit. Our only problem was how were we going to mount this! But we took a chance and ordered it anyway. The package arrived fast, nothing missing and everything was in excellent condition. It was fairly easy to assemble, the instructions go thru everything you have to do step by step. When it came to the actual mounting we had a minor set back. We had no stud finder, but no big deal we ordered one on amazon for less then $10,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CH-Hanson-03040-Magnetic-Stud-Finder/dp/B000IKK0OI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CH Hanson 03040 Magnetic Stud Finder</a>&nbsp;. The instructions recommended mounting the desk on three studs, but where the desk would look perfect we only found two so we took the chance and set it up. we have had the desk set-up for a month or two and no problems. Its very sturdy and we are pleased with it. We also bought a track light that sits right under the top shelf for night uses,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/RiteLite-LPL704-Battery-Operated-12-LED-Under-Cabinet-Track-Light/dp/B000R9P4GE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">RiteLite LPL704 Battery-Operated 12-LED Under-Cabinet Track Light</a>&nbsp;. Our desk is mounted right next to one of our 55 gallon fish tanks and i LOVE looking over at it while working.";AWSOME DESK!!!! =]
37;12.0;5.0;47.0;"Very solid wall desk. For sizing, the newer thinner (2012+) 27 inch iMac will fit in the main opening perfectly with just a bit of room on each side. I did take the top middle section finishing piece that hides the wall rail and leave it off. I didn't leave it off because I needed room for the iMac, but I put the piece on the bottom just on top of the aluminum stand to hide the cables, as simple as that nothing more to buy! Past that there is a box to keep the power strip and excess cable. I used that for a power line conditioner and a power strip, with the power adapters that power my accessories. Basically this is the cleanest look that I could get for my setup.\n\nNow for the potential deal killer for some. Keep in mind that this is a fairly heavy desk, the desk is very solid, but your wall may not be. It comes with 3 screws to mount to wood studs. I did not think about this, I usually have metal studs, which there is a work around, but not where I mounted it. Because I think that Satan himself must have designed the building, they mounted the drywall to bricks. I decided to take this as a plus and got concrete/brick anchors (basically specific screws). I got the set from Buildex Tapcon that came with the correct drill bit in the box to minimize issues, it was about $17. After blindly drilling away a few did not hold- that is because I hit mortar, no problem just drill another hole an inch or two away. I used about 10 screws total which should net me over 500 pounds of holding power!\n\nThis unit literally has a rail (single piece of metal) that you mount to the wall, then place the unit onto that. That's it nothing else holds it. While I was putting it up I was fairly unsure, but once I got it up to it the rest was easy. I had to pound the desk down to seat it properly in the rail system. Word of advice I now know, back the screws up just a bit and don't tighten fully until the unit is in place; then tighten the screws after it is up. The way that it is designed lets you have access to the screws while it is up. As long as the screws don't magically back out of the brick this will never come down accidently. FYI in the manual they recommend only to mount this on wood studs.\n\nBasically it is particle board and MDF (the MDF is the main desk surface which reduces vibrations-unlike my Ikea piece), covered by thicker black veneer. It is similar to how flat pack furniture was made before Ikea, it is more solid than almost any Ikea piece today. They are a canadian company and seem to make better stuff than even higher priced items, it was packed so well that there was multiple spots of damage on the box, but not to the product. That said I do wish they had a solid wood model option, even if it was a higher cost. But this is the best wall mounted desk I could find, and the price is very good for what you get! Would purchase again.";Solid Wall Desk That Fits A 2012+ 27 Inch iMac Great!
7;13.0;5.0;23.0;Great desk! Do yourself a favor before hanging it,  go to Home Depot for a couple of heavy duty hex screws. The provided screws weren't strong enough to drive into the stud and broke. We mounted it higher and bought a counter height bar stool. My teen loves her new study area!;Love this desk!
34;14.0;5.0;36.0;Using this as a standing desk, and couldn't be happier with it! Putting it together took a while, but instructions were easy to follow and the anchor screws it came with help make it EXTREMELY sturdy. I love the added storage I have for all of my knick-knacks and office supplies. Would definitely recommend this!\n\nOne note to future buyers- As other reviewers have stated, it's a flat surface and there is no slide-out keyboard tray. The way it's built, you might have trouble installing a keyboard tray (see picture), but if you have a monitor riser or something similar, you'll be able to get your monitor high enough to be comfortable.;Awesome Standing Desk Option
13;15.0;3.0;26.0;this was an awesome idea for my daughters room as she needed a bigger floor footprint since buying new and bigger bedroom furniture. I love the size of the desk, the amount and placement of the cubbies and that is it big but not to big. It was fairly simple to hang a little heavy but not that bad ......However.....when i received the desk i found that the parts were not all there!...i was able to hang it (missing a nut for the main hanging bracket) and affix the cover board (missing 2 plastic pegs of the 3 needed) that hides the hanging hardware. i had to jerry rig until the manufacturer sends the missing hardware parts. this is NOT long enough to be able to use all 3 hanging screws as it comes 3 inches shy of a standard studded wall...so make sure you double screw (2 screws right next to each other in the same stud) it if only using 2 studs!!! (or it will feel a little less stable)\n******so 1 no star for the missing hardware and 1 no star for the fact that it DOES NOT secure the hanging bracket to the hanging bar...so if you were underneath it cleaning and bumped it hard enough it could lift off the hanging bar and fall on you!!!!;great desk but needs a few things
44;16.0;1.0;34.0;I put the desk together and it just lies on the floor. I tried placing it on the wall and it just fell. Thanks gravity! I also took it outside to help get it a running start but that too did not work. Finally, I threw it off an extremely high cliff. From where I was standing it looked like it just fell to the ground, but it could have actually started to float as it approached the ground.;Doesn't actually float
1;17.0;4.0;14.0;"Super happy with this purchase!  I was looking for a floating desk for a while - and I couldn't pass this one up based on looks, reviews and price.  It looks even better in person.  It is perfect for what I need it for.  I was lucky enough to only have to order the desk, and left it up to my husband to assemble and install.  We did add one extra support screw, because you do catch yourself leaning on it getting out of a chair every once in awhile.\n\nBelow are his comments in regards to the assemble and install:\n\nSliding the pieces in at the end did pull the laminate up a little on the edges and it wasn't the easiest to slide in.  There were a lot of little spots on the edges that needed to be ""deluxed"" with the brown marker and the laminate did not completely come to the edge on one side of the desk.\n\nThe instructions should say to install the mount rail on the wall and then slightly back off the bolts so that the hooks can get in between it and the wall and then tighten them back to the wall - this was an issue because the wall was not completely level - and I imagine that would be an issue in other homes as well.\n\nThe silver screws should have a recess so that they can be screwed in flush and then the little plastic brown cap would sit flush with the piece they are in.\n\nNo idea what the Allen rod thing is for that was included.  Usually Allen wrenches are in an L shape like the silver one but the black one was just straight.  Never had to use it.\n\nThe storage shelves are not completely secure, as they sit on top of little holders.  Slots would be better but that wouldn't look as good so maybe make them with a much more dense particle board.""";Super happy with this purchase
55;18.0;4.0;36.0;First, the shipping on this item took a bit to process. Took well over a week to arrive, but that's fine as it arrived unscathed.\n\nSecond. Assembly is easy with all things considered. There is a moderate number of panels to assemble, so it is fairly time consuming (approx. 1.5 - 2 hours unless you're a wizz at this sort of thing)\n\nThird. My primary gripe about the product is that the small side shelves are just a smidgen too small for a DVD case to stand upright. I don't really have much else to put in these shelves, so they're minimally useful...Could always leave one shelf out, but that just messes with the symmetry of things!\n\nFourth. I have no issues with the wire cut-outs as another reviewer suggested. However, I am using the desk as more of a laptop home-base, so this means less A/C adapters than many.\n\nFinally. Overall a great product, that does as it's supposed to. Well designed, and the instructions don't require an engineering degree to decipher. A drill is stated as required, but I would also recommend access to a measuring tape and a level prior to the mounting step.;Does as it should, with nice style.
26;19.0;5.0;25.0;The desk is cheap but when comes in, it is very nice wood and comes with everything needed to make it even look nicer, I have gotten so many compliments over it after putting it in my room, the only annoying thing was finding the studs to hook it up to but other than that the desk came so nicely and it is incredibly convenient to use and looks modern. So many benefits with not dealing with desks that have broken legs or the space to put it or someone always walking by and kicking it accidentally, this is just hooked on and good to go;it is very nice wood and comes with everything needed to make it ...
11;20.0;3.0;20.0;"It is actually a pretty decent unit, but the unit shipped to me had nothing in the form of a metal hanging bracket nor is it mentioned in the ""ONE"" page of instructions that came with it. I cant imagine how they even expect someone to assemble this unit without instructions. I have been in the construction trades for 25+ yrs, so I was able to figure it out. Good luck to you if you do not have some real knowledge about how things should be built. I also had to make my own hanging device. Overall, it worked out fine and my daughter is happy with the unit. I'll attach the one page instruction sheet in case you want to study it before you buy one. I just assembled a 24 dollar TV cart from Walmart that had 4 pages of instructions and 1/10 of the pieces. Like I said, overall it is a decent unit. Just be prepared  for a nightmare assembly process.";Good luck!
48;21.0;5.0;30.0;"This desk is awesome.  We got one from my daughters room makeover.  And I love it so much, I'm getting one for our bedroom.  Its strong and very well made.  I was able to put it together by myself - but needed help mounting it.  The ""recommended"" desk height for the mounting is made for an extremely short person apparently.  Keep in mind that there is no separate shelving for the monitor/keyboard - leaving the monitor at chest level.  It's was even too low for my nine year old; she had to hunch over to do her homework.  It's easy enough to fix after mounting - just raising the mounting bar up a few inches and reattach desk.  Calculate your desired height.";Awesome - HOWEVER be careful of the instructions!
54;22.0;5.0;31.0;"I really love this desk! I bought it in black and it fits in well with my other espresso colored wood furniture in the room. Since I am using it in my dining/living room, I opted to mount it a little higher than recommended so that I could transfer a dining chair to the desk when working on the computer. I chose this desk because the location where I wanted to place it in my combo room splits between tile and carpet and a non-floating desk would not sit level in that location. I didn't even know that floating desks were an option when I stumbled upon this desk and it serves its purpose well!\n\nMy husband (a mechanic) was able to put it together and mount it on the wall by himself in less than an hour. It comes with a bracket that mounts to the wall, and it fits onto the bracket for easy mounting and removal. The center section of the desk fits our 27"" iMac perfectly, but we had to forego the additional moulding that fits across the top of this section (designed to hide the mounting bracket from view). No problem, though, because the monitor fits so perfectly that it hides the bracket anyway. There is a ""box"" under the desk portion, in the back, which holds a surge protector and hides it from view. Since we didn't have an outlet directly behind the desk, we simply drilled a hole in the side of the desk to run the cord through for the plug.\n\nThe desk was very slightly damaged during shipping - it got a small scratch on one of the large wing panels on the side, but it came with a wood pen and after a quick touch up, it looked fine. I would recommend this desk to anyone!";Great Desk!
17;23.0;5.0;19.0;This desk was a birthday gift for my son. I was concerned about ordering furniture off the internet and had previously had bad experiences with pieces being damaged. Although this is a very heavy desk and the corners of the box were a bit banged up the desk inside was in great condition. I love the design of the desk and it is sturdy and well built, but most importantly my son LOVES it! I will warn you to make sure the height you set it at is high enough to clear the ledge that is underneath the desktop surface. We have to be very careful when we slide our chair underneath, but if we'd mounted it another inch higher it would be easier.;I was concerned about ordering furniture off the internet and had previously had bad experiences with pieces being damaged
58;24.0;5.0;29.0;Special for small spaces where every inch counts. Sturdy construction.\nGreat packing. No mistakes building it, Easy to follow the instructions!;So loving my legless desk!
53;25.0;4.0;26.0;Purchased one of these desks for my teenage son to do his homework.  I'm thankful for the reviews suggesting installation 1.5 inches above the recommended height to clear wall outlets.  Installed a LED light fixture under the top shelf and a power strip on the bottom.  Looks good in his room. We liked it so much we bought another for our younger son.  Good price value relationship.;Well worth the money
27;26.0;4.0;18.0;"I am very pleased with this desk. The pieces were not labeled but they were not difficult to identify if you have experience putting together this type of furniture. The wood screws used to mount the bar to the wall are tightened by an Allen wrench which my husband hated. If you have that type of bit for your drill, use it. The instructions for measuring the height to mount on the wall I think had a typo. Just measure carefully and understand the measurements in the diagrams may need to be adjusted based on your needs. I had to bump everything up about 1.5"" because our outlets are higher. Now that the desk is up I love it. It doesn't take up too much space which was perfect for my needs.";Relatively easy to put together and looks great
31;27.0;5.0;16.0;"This is a great desk. Assembling was neither difficult nor super easy. I was able to mount it on my own but I would recommend using help. I'm 5' 10"" and I feel weird when I sit on my swivelling executive-ish chair. I would say if you're my height or taller then get yourself something to raise the monitor in order to be able to use the keyboard comfortably. Or preferably make yourself a sliding drawer for keyboard and mouse/trackpad. It looks very nice. and is easy to keep clean. If you're anything like me and have multiple hard-drives then consider getting a surge protector outlet, something like this (http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Outlet-Pivot-Surge-Protector/dp/B000JE9LD4). Getting the cables set is extremely tricky since the back doesn't have a lot of space to work with. My 2014 Mac Mini and the 27' Asus monitor sits perfectly. The picture shows the initial setup. I will post an update once I have it looking as planned. :)\n\nP.S. Unlike a traditional table you cannot move this table around. Once it's there, IT'S THERE! :P";Good buy
20;28.0;5.0;13.0;Desk was an easy install and looks great! I love it. It saves a lot of space and yet still has enough room to get things done.\n\nOnly bad thing is, once its hanging up, it's hard to get the cables to come in and out of the small space in the back of the desk meant to hide everything. So if you add things to it afterwards it's a pain to get the new cords inside.;Great desk.
21;29.0;5.0;13.0;This unit has made a huge difference in our home-office.  Did not realize just how crowded we were until we installed the desk.  One side of our office now looks great, so much so, that I just ordered a second unit to clear up the other side.\n\nAssembly can be a bit taxing but they tell you up front that this is a two person job.  Pay very close attention to the different types of bolts used throughout the assembly.  The parts description is very detailed and if you put everything together as instructed, you will have no parts left over.  Assembly time for two fairly intelligent folks is about 90 minutes.  If you have questions, there are videos and tech support to take you through it, very well supported product.\n\nPhoto attached is moments after install, still organizing.;Great Space Saver!
15;30.0;5.0;11.0;It took about a day to assemble and mount to the wall with only a few tools. I was not sure I would be able to put it together when I opened the box. It looked like a jigsaw puzzle. Much of the hardware wasn't familiar either. And it is heavy. The instructions are pretty much pictures... so if I had never put together furniture before I think I would have panicked! The only thing I would have done differently, and only because of where I mounted it, is to raise it up about 4 inches. I didn't allow for the outlet and the bottom face board so had to leave that off. Not a problem structurally and a pretty acceptable mistake for me.;Exactly as you see and nicer than you think
2;31.0;4.0;7.0;my item came chipped in different areas, I'm not sure if thats the reason it comes with a marker in side. but it didn't do the job, cause i still had to go buy paint to cover them chips since they where deep and wide, the instructions , sucked bad!!! so it will take you sometime putting it together , once my desk was up and finished, it looks good and fits with my 27inch iMac as seen on the pictures. hope my post helps you all.;i think its worth buying at the end.
28;32.0;5.0;12.0;"Great price and fairly easy to install. The only problem was the anchor bolts that mount into the studs. It was an allen wrench head lag bolt and I stripped out the head before I could finish. Luckily I was able to vice gripe it out. I had some 4"" screws the same size, but were socket driven. Used those.  Highly recommend going to your local hardware store first. Also raised it to 36"" and looks a lot nicer";Great desk, raised to 36 inches. Replace allen head with socket head lag bolts for wall.
3;33.0;5.0;7.0;Just got this desk put together but so far I am very impressed. It looks gorgeous assembled and on the wall. It is a very versatile, space saving solution for anyone who needs it. One of my favorite things is the cord storage underneath so you can hide all those unsightly cords. This is especially nice if your desk is in a common area where you would not want those seen.  It is big enough to fit a power strip, all the ports full and cords tucked inside with room to spare. The cubbies are somewhat adjustable for your needs, I chose to leave one shelf out to have an opening for my taller items with a cord pulled thru (yes small cord openings on both sides in addition to the main one at the back) so I can charge my iPad during storage and/or my phone when at my desk. From what I've seen of other users, it is pretty customizable and I intend to do a few more things such as a peel and stick white board on the bar that goes across the back, some puck lighting for either above the desk of right under the top shelf and maybe a letter bin attached to the side to hold papers.\n\nThe dimensions of the openings are as follows, these are not super precise but really close (bottom right with 1 shelf removed):\n\nTop left - w 6 1/4 x h 5 3/4\nMiddle left - w 6 1/4 x h 6 7/8\nBottom left- w 6 1/4 x h 6 1/2\nUpper Right- w 6 1/4 x h 5 3/4\nBottom Right- w 6 1/4 x h 14\nMiddle Opening- w 27 1/8 x h 20 1/2;Awesome Space Saving Desk!
25;34.0;4.0;11.0;fairly simple installation following along with the instructions. other than trying to find the studs in my wall (hahah) the desk its self is pretty sturdy and decent quality considering thr price. I recommend installing the desk at the height the instructions say to do. only reason whu this product gets a b+ and not an a is because one of the shelves was cracked/defective on arrival. I did not notice until I was almost finished installing. I highly recommend inspecting all pieces before putting the desk together. other than that I love the desk! Looks great, saves room, and is fairly sturdy.;B+
50;35.0;5.0;14.0;"This desk is pretty fabulous. It did take a little while to get here, even though is is Prime, but I can't hold that against it.\n\nIt arrived with all the pieces (including hardware and instructions) and took me about an hour to put together, working on it casually. I wasn't setting out to break any installation records. Nothing is labelled or marked, however, so once I opened up the box I did have to go through and check off each piece as it was listed to ensure I did have everything. It also comes with a furniture marker in case you make any scratches during assembly, which I thought was very cool.\n\nIt comes with a metal bracket that attaches to three studs in your wall with some heavy duty screws. Once the bracket is installed on the wall, the desk simply hooks on to the bracket. It is amazingly sturdy. It is listed ""not to exceed"" 100lbs which is an amazing amount of weight for a desk to hold...\n\nIt doesn't looks cheap or chintzy. It looks like a nice piece of furniture. I appreciate the top shelf, as I am able to put a lamp up there that illuminates the whole surface of the desk, rather than a lamp in one corner of the work surface.";Great item
4;36.0;1.0;6.0;I ordered this desk a couple weeks ago. When we tried to put it together, the holes didn't line up for one of the boards. So we sent it back. we tried again because we really liked the design of this desk. Ordered another one right away. We got it today (9/15/16). The first board we pulled out of it was broken!! Not a small crack. It was flat out BROKEN! My husband and I really wanted this desk because it mounts to the wall. We are so disappointed and angry!! Don't waste your time, money or stress on this product, PLEASE! Now we have to spend several more hours doing research and picking a desk that will meet our needs! A desk that we really needed two weeks ago!!;MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT
8;37.0;3.0;7.0;This desk is really tiny for an adult to work on. The side compartments will only fit small accessories, so don't expect to take out the shelves and put in your tower. There's no easy way to add speakers to this desk, unless you have really long auxiliary cords.\n\nCheap-non-solid wood. The paint is already coming off where my I use my mouse. I think I've only used it for a month. My parents sell furniture, so judging from the material, you would get expect to get something much nicer for the price range. I''m waiting for a more a well known company to manufacture this style of desk so I can replace it.\n\nThe three stars are for style. It does look pretty on your wall. I just wish it was bigger.;There's no easy way to add speakers to this desk
24;38.0;5.0;9.0;Perfect;Five Stars
6;39.0;5.0;6.0;Took me a couple hours to put the desk together and hang it.  Directions were easy to follow. I bought this desk to provide a presentable place for my daughter to study.  This in not a family heirloom to pass down to the next generation.  It is a well designed pressed board piece of functional furniture.  It looks nice and seems sturdy enough to use for multiple years.  Just don't sit on it or load it up with a bunch of junk.  A value for just over $100.  Daughter loves it!  My only complaint would be the visible metallic bolts on the side of the desk.  The company provided white plastic plugs for the screw heads, but do not provide plugs for the bolts.  Not a big deal...just the one thing I would change.;Beyond Expectations
49;40.0;2.0;12.0;I was hoping for a White floating desk and on the first shipment got a brown desk. No worries, so I returned the desk and received a second desk that was also brown. If it is brown don't call it a White desk. I will be returning this as well. Maybe they will get it right on the third time. Not all that hopeful.;Not what I ordered
42;41.0;1.0;11.0;Very poor quality.  Particle board.  Difficult to assemble.  Had to pay someone to assemble and half way through the assembly, the parts did not match upHad to abandon.  Amazon was great about refunding my money.;floating desk
5;42.0;1.0;5.0;"Desk arrived with damaged top shelf, but the overall quality was far less than expected. The particle board was flimsy, and desk only fits on a wall bracket with no option to secure the bottom.  However, I never was able to install on the wall.  The install required 3 studs that are spaced at 16"".  Unfortunately, my house and many other modem houses are built with 2x6 studs that are spaced at 24"".  This spacing makes it impossible to mount with 3 studs.  I called the manufacturer, and they agreed that I was out of luck.  Currently boxing up the parts the best I can for UPS to pick up for a full return.";Quality is poor, mounting doesn't seem to be secure
9;43.0;5.0;6.0;Sturdy, functional and neat design. Arrived quickly and decentently priced. Has a hidden shelf area for cords. The top shelf is wide enough for office supplies (not wide enough for things like a printer though).;Great desk, cool design, functional and sturdy.
18;44.0;5.0;7.0;"I bought this desk about 2 years ago ams wanted to wait to post my review because often times when you buy furniture that are priced at a steal,  a year later they tend to warp, chip, and eventually look like what you paid for... but not this desk!!! I have inatalled her, took her down, moved with her, installed again and my baby is STILL as beautiful as the day I first got her. There is plenty of space, however,  I do wish that the little shelves were able to be secured to the unit because I wouldn't have lost them in the move if they were still attached but eh... what can you do! Lol People compliment me on this desk ALL the time (especially living in Brooklyn where space is limited in apartments) and I doubt that I could've made a smarter buy.  I highly recommend this desk to anyone and oh! I saw a review of someone who gave it one star because they claim to keep bumping their knees on the bottom of the desk but, easy fix.... MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL THE DESK HIGH ENOUGH ON THE WALL! Only takes a second to measure properly ;)";2 YEARS LATER & STILL HOLDING STRONG!!!
19;45.0;4.0;7.0;"I have a small bedroom for a teen and this worked perfectly.  It took me a bit to put together and we added blue rope back lighting once hung on the wall.  I gave it 4 stars because after we hung it, one of the shelves fell off and actually took a 1/4"" chunk out of the laminate!  After taking such care putting in together and hanging it, something so simple actually damaged it.  We backlit it with blue rope light under that top valance board.  Looks great.";You can easily see why we love this desk.
23;46.0;5.0;7.0;Very good desk. Very organized and modern.;Awesome Desk!
36;47.0;5.0;8.0;"Alright everyone, here's the deal.  Wife and I live in a condo and needed to clear out the command center in the second bedroom for a new arrival.  Came across corner desks, narrow side tables/desks, and then this awesome creation.  This now hangs perfectly in our living room as a work station.\n\nShipping - Arrived next day via Amazon Prime (close distro center)\n\nPackaging - No tear in the packaging, it came in one uniform, slightly heavy box.  All pieces were accounted for\n\nSetup - The instructions are very straight forward and easy to follow.  You just need some patience to separate out the pieces and account for everything\n\nTime - Approximately 2 hours to set up\n\nConsiderations - I followed what another gentleman has noted when placing near an electrical outlet.  He suggested 56 inches from the ground to the top of the assembly, assuming your outlet is about 19 inches off the ground.  I'm 5'6"", and this is slightly higher than I thought it would be, but perfect for standing.  At this height and setup, you would need a chair with about a 24 inch height.  I actually don't mind it at this current height only because it prevents a new born or toddler from smacking their head into the corners.  The cubby hole underneath is genius in hiding all the cords.\n\nUse - 27 inch iMac 2013.  Made to fit.  less than a millimeter of clearance.\n\nI highly recommend this for those with small spaces and need to utilize space without taking up the floor.  You won't regret this purchase.";Just plain awesome!
12;48.0;5.0;5.0;I'm giving it 5 stars because of the quality that you get at the price range.  If it were $300, I'd probably give it only 4 stars.  I do have a little experience with prepac products as I've installed 2 of their entertainment consoles in the past, which might have made installation go a bit quicker for me, but I think I had this thing assembled and hung in about 30 minutes with no help.  It is surprisingly sturdy and I thought had a couple nice features that I didn't expect: 1) there is a built in space hidden behind the desk, which is more than large enough to fit a power strip into.  2) there is also a hidden space behind the trim piece that goes across the top of the desk area, which would be perfect for hiding an LED strip.  3) there is a built in notch at the bottom of the shelves on the left and right side of the desk to allow for running cords or power or speaker wire over to the shelves without having to drill.  Definitely giving it 5 stars since it only cost me about $135 and it looks sharp and it makes the room that it's in feel bigger, since it doesn't sit on the floor.  This is an especially good desk if you only use a laptop or an all-in-one PC.  If you have a tower that you'd need to connect, you can also put it to the left or right by just not installing one of the shelves or by putting both shelves up higher, since the shelf height is adjustable.  I think I read a couple reviews where people said that their screws broke off.  I had none of these issues. Definitely predrill your holes when you mount the hanging bracket to the studs in your wall.  The directions say to do this and my only guess is that people that have screws break either didn't predrill or predrilled with too small of a drill bit.  I think I used a 5/16th bit for my predrilling, but am not positive on that.;Nice desk for the price.  I would buy again.
14;49.0;5.0;5.0;Easy to build easy to hang, Spans 3 studs, just wish it had rounded corners, but perfect design for laptop, make up and home work, Top is not laminated but looks semi durable, edge of top has plastic laminate wish top had same but to new to say it it will last. Just my input, Also if you are using adjustable office chair I would mount 1 inch higher.;Easy to build easy to hang
33;50.0;5.0;6.0;A great piece.  It doesn't take a lot of room but hold a lot, looks modern and well built, and sitting at it now.  Just followed the instructions and I was done in about a half an hour and ready to hang.  Leveled the hanging bar ans screwed in, lifted and dropped into place.  About 45 min start to finish.  Note:  Common sense has to prevail here when screwing in the bar into the wall.  Many walls (drywall) are not perfectly flat.  There are usually bellies or high spots that you don't see with the naked eye.  But when you put that very straight steel bar up against your wall to hang, if your wall bellies in at a spot or two, don't put a screw in this spot, as you will then actually bend it and your desk will not sit on the bar like it's supposed to.  The desk piece to fit on the bar is straight and so is the bar that goes onto the wall.;A great piece. It doesn't take a lot of room ...
41;51.0;1.0;7.0;I wasn't impressed, returned this product. It mounts very low in order to have a chair sit properly, the proportion in the picture don't look the same when it's hung. Ours came missing a couple of peices, and most importantly, the instructions! All if these little parts and prices must be put together correctly. I had hired someone to come help me, spent hours trying to get someone on the phone or to answer am email and send me the directions. Very disappointed, I couldn't get that money back! :(;Not Happy With The Quality
60;52.0;4.0;8.0;This is a pretty nice desk.  Assembly took me about 90 minutes.  The instructions are well written and easy to follow.\nOne thing you may not notice unless you look REALLY close at the picture is that there are some chrome finish bolt heads that whow on the sides of the desk.  Not a deal breaker by any means, it just looks a little different than the picure.;A nice desk
16;53.0;4.0;5.0;"I like the desk. It opened up some space in the alcove that I use for my desktop. The alcove is small and was formerly used to house an organ by the previous home owner. I did have to modify the vertical space on the left end of the desk to allow me to put my computer tower. It was a bit too narrow. I repositioned the vertical piece and shortened the horizontal piece in the center.  I have a great deal of experience in woodworking and furniture design. If you have a computer without a tower; no problem!\nAssembly took about two hours (without my personal modification). I suggest using a power screwdriver and a nut-driver with a proper allen-wrench bit. I also used a rubber hammer to seat the pieces that cover the mounting hardware. Don't use a steel hammer, you'll damage the Formica veneer.\nThe overall design is solid and braced well to prevent it racking off square. It went together with no problems. I bought some storage cubes at a Dollar Store to add some storage for disks, paper, etc. that you need for the computer. It also has my printer on top of the cube, because there's no room for the printer on the desk. Overall, I'm pleased, especially when you consider the price. I couldn't build it myself for that price.";Very Pleased, but with reservations.
35;54.0;3.0;6.0;Very modern and good looking, but not good multitasking. You either write (using a pen and a notebook), or use a computer, but never both (there isn't enough space). So you're a multi-tasker consider roomier table.;Very modern and good looking, but not good multitasking
47;55.0;4.0;7.0;I bought two of these, one white and one espresso for my daughter's offices. Everything fits together well, assembly is simple enough and they look nice on the wall.\nThey ARE particle board, which I was aware of but seems some think they are solid wood. Both desks had at least one piece with corner damage but it was minimal -looks like it happened in shipping. Just be careful to not put any drinks on these that sweat without a coaster or your particle board will bubble and leave a permanent scar.\nAll in all, perfect for a kids desk. Tidy, space saving and functional.;Bought two
51;56.0;5.0;7.0;i really love this product. it took half a day to put it together, but it was worth it. you'll need a drill, a level, a stud finder, and a crescent wrench. i've had the desk for 2 weeks now and i cant stop looking at it. im very excited to use it (im using it right now lol) it is attractive to look at, and it does not wabble. the only thing i can think of is the finish: im not sure how much use it will endure before it gets a scratch it it. i have the white model. im very pleased with this product. highly recommended.;good quality
56;57.0;5.0;7.0;"I loved this product it is a well made computer desk and shelf system but; it has a thousand (not really) bolts and nuts to assemble. I did not expect it to have so many bolts; yet it is prefect for long sections on the computer. I wanted to find a desk that would reduce the neck strain I was having with a floor desk. And this was it to me; by positioning this shelf in relation to your personal height on the wall. You will be able to adjust it so that; your head is always being held in an upright position this is great for those of us suffering from bending our necks all these years on a computer. This item can be ergonomically a real blessing.\n\nAll put together... it was an easy fit!!!\n\nAt first I complained about all the nuts and bolts because; I did not think I would be able to put it together so, I never tried. But,it keep coming into my heart to try so; after about two weeks of it being on the living room floor I said ok I will try. What I learned was amazing the bolts and nuts were very funny made but; they are designed to act like to me re-bars and make the desk more solid. The bolts do not go directly into the partial boards itself; without going through in the most important areas a reinforcement nut and/or a locking system nut. Which makes the desk very sound we all know how items are that are make out of partly/mostly partial boards. I was very impressed with these specialized bolts and nuts styles. I actually by following the directions and pictures put this desk together by myself (a lady)... OK, ""well... with the help of The LORD"" and I enjoyed doing it very much and thought ""I was thinking about paying someone fifty bucks!!"" I even put the bar that the desk will hang on from the wall into the stubs in the wall--with that ally wrench thing (a wonderful tool) after stating the hole with a slush hammer (I do not own a power drill). Even the suggested height measurements were right on key. They took all the guess workout of this project for us and I learned that it was truly an easy fit and a fun project. My desk is very sturdy and I will not fear anymore trying to do; do-it-yourself projects from now on.\n\nMakeeba";Nice, but Not a easy fix...All put together and it was an easy fit
30;58.0;4.0;5.0;I like the desk, it takes up so much less room than my old one and I can get under it easy to pick up things that fall or to clean the floor.  The bad part is it is a 2 man job to put it up and I found out the builder did not put the studs in where they were supposed to be.  I put a paper chalk board in back on the wall.  I even found a stool that fit perfect and is the same color, but not on Amazon.;Great for smaller rooms.
43;59.0;5.0;6.0;This fit perfectly in a small unused corner of my living room.  Now I can computer in warmth next to the fire in the living room instead of in the Siberia of the bedroom.  If you have a cordless drill/driver and an open space of about 8'x8' you can put this together in about an hour and a half.  I was even able to hang it on the wall by myself by balancing it on my office chair and rolling it into position, then raising and lowering the seat height until it was just right.  That part would have definitely been easier with two people though.  It doesn't have a lot of extra storage space, obviously, but all I needed was a spot to put my all in one computer with wireless keyboard and mouse, and for that it's perfect. I did have to use the jigsaw to make the opening in the shelf below about one inch wider to fit a small APC UPS 550G.  The shelf was designed for a power strip only, but after widening the opening the battery back up fit perfectly.  Now to sweep or vacuum, I just wheel the chair out of the way and go.  No legs, or cords in the way.  I love it.;Good for tight spaces
38;60.0;1.0;5.0;The front edge of the desk where the computer sits is damaged and cracked on the top and the edge. And the wooden dowels were missing. I paid someone to assemble and hang the desk and did not notice the damage until it was hung. They want me to disassemble the entire desk and put it back in the box. Which would take a couple hours if I could even fit it back in the box. All I wanted was them to send me a replacement part for the damaged area. BUT NO!!! I won't buy stuff like this on Amazon again. If I would have purchased it from a physical location, they would have gladly given a new board to replace the damages piece,;DAMAGED and missing parts!
40;61.0;5.0;5.0;I looked for 6 weeks for the perfect desk for my I mac Computer. I had been a laptop Dell user for many years-  the last Dell was a lemon and I will never buy another one. I needed something small for my office that serves as a bedroom, pullout coach when my daughters visit. This was my solution. I was more than please with all the cubby squares for things like EVERYTHING I use for my small on line business. It was easy for my husband to put on the wall, just a stud finder and a level. The black is very modern looking , I would recommend ditching the old style for this Floating Desk !!! You will be amazed at how much it holds ....This has been my BEST amazon purchase . i have been a amazon prime member for 4 years. If you need a desk, you will enjoy this one hands down...Kimberly;Fantastic way to save Space and have A FULL SIZE desk...

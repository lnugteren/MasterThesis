77;1.0;3.0;329.0;"To begin, I really like the scope. It looks great on my M&P 15/22, the magnification range is perfect for a .22, and the optics are surprisingly sharp for this price range. I mounted the scope and had it zeroed in 10 shots (at 25 yards due to limited space). The lighted reticle works great against a dark target. The elevation and windage knobs click properly and the locks work as advertised. Really good quality for the price with a few (one big) exceptions.\n\nNow for the negatives. I really only have two but one is a pretty big annoyance. First, the battery door on the control knob for the lighted reticle gets unscrewed when I twist the knob. Not a really big deal but if there was some kind of slot so you could use a quarter or something to tighten the cover it would all but eliminate this minor issue. The bigger problem is that I too received a scope with a rotated reticle (I posted the second reticle photo - with the levels pictured). I realize this is an inexpensive scope but seriously, it IS a rifle scope and what is more important than the reticle on a rifle scope? And how hard could it possibly be to engineer a manufacturing process to ensure a level reticle? Alignment marks? A small notch? I would think this would be a very simple and obvious concern for a scope manufacturer to fix. We'll see. I just ordered a replacement from Amazon and if everything else works like the first scope AND the reticle is straight I will certainly come back and give 5 stars.\n\nOne final note on the manufacturer... I sent a support request online (to Leapers), not trying to return it to Leapers but just asking about the rotated reticle and politely asking if this was a fluke or if Leapers considered this to be an ""acceptable variation"" in the manufacturing process. I was simply trying to determine whether I need to go through the replacement process or look for something else. Two days later and no reply whatsoever. I'm pretty big on customer service and this leaves a really bad impression on me for a company I'm buying from. As I said earlier though, if the replacement has a straight reticle and otherwise works like the first one, I'll consider it a five star scope for the money.\n\nUpdate 5/7/2012\nI received the replacement scope today and it too had a rotated reticle though not as bad. I've decided to return it as well and purchase a little nicer scope. I'm just too anal to let a rotated reticle slide since the whole point of a scope revolves around the reticle. It's like a watch maker that makes a perfectly nice watch that does everything right except keep time. For general plinking or for an airsoft gun, this might be fine. If you can live with a rotated reticle (meaning if you adjust elevation you'll have to adjust windage as well just to compensate for the slanted reticle - not to mention either having your scope mounted crooked or sight with a slanted reticle), it's perfectly fine other than that. Apparently, judging by the positive reviews, not all of these scopes may have this issue. Maybe you'll get one that's not affected and in that case you'll have a decent little scope for the money.\n\nAlso, Leapers did send me an email response today and they offered to replace the scope at no cost - actually wanted to have their engineers look at my scope, but I had already started the return process with Amazon.";I Really Wanted to Love It
0;2.0;5.0;297.0;"Well, i never owned a utg product before and i finally bit on the price/perfomance ratio propaganda.  I have a Centerpoint 4-16x40 rifle scope that is all out of proportion to its cost.  It is a very good scope and has been on my .308 for over a year.  I handload and shoot a lot with pretty stout loads for hunting(not a box or two a year..frequent range sessions with 50 rounds of .308, 50 of .223 and 500 or so .22).  The centerpoint is a rock solid optic that just doesn't cost much.  Rumours were that leapers and centerpoint were the same scopes, so i just had to try one from UTG.\n\nFirst of all let me say i see similarities in the two brands, but there are differences that make me believe they use the same factory, but not the same specifications.  I will add that i slightly prefer the centerpoint, but they don't make a CQB scope like this one.\n\nThe leapers scope is a beautiful thing to look at, as is the centerpoint.  They are both heavily built (and heavy, BTW) and simply gorgeous on or off the gun.  But looks don't really count much after you paint them camouflage, so the equipment has to perform.  Out of the box, the centerpoint takes the edge regarding fit and finish of the controls and flip up caps.  On my new utg, the ocular end cap was shipped with the ridges installed over the ridges and the rubber is stretched so that proper installation is loose.  This results in the cap falling off, especially if you try to flip the cap open.  I batted this one around in my head and decided to use some electrical tape inside the flip up lens cover to fill the depressions a little.  Don't try this with cheap electrical tape.  I have the good stuff.\n\nIt works fine this way, but i think it should have been right out of the box, even for 74 bucks.  The centerpoint was perfect in every way and it was only 70bucks in a blister pack at walmart.  While i'm on that...the packaging of the utg wins hands down.  It is very good protective display packaging with all the details and nice graphics...little things tell me something about where this company is trying to go.  The scope arrived in perfect condition except for the one end cap.  The objective end cap is perfect.  All tools are included, two batteries, and the rings were separately boxed and wrapped.\n\nThe fit of the AO and magnification control functions is so tight they are difficult to move, score one for centerpoint.  The lock rings on the w/e knobs are tough to loosen and tighten, aggravated by the close quarters of the short body of this scope.  Still, the clicks are firm and precise and exactly 1/4"" @ 100 yards as advertised..which makes sight-in a breeze.  I was in the 10 ring on shot number 7.  I think UTG takes the nod here.  I haven't tried to reset the zero yet, but i suspect it is as with the centerpoint...be careful here and follow the instructions.  It wasn't as simple as it seemed on the centerpoint...but it does work and is a nice feature most folks won't care about anyway.  BTW, the instructions for that procedure are pretty much word for word with the centerpoint..same factory..i think so.\n\nBoth scopes have adjustable objectives that are accurately marked for yardage.  Good job.  It's nice to be able to range something and set the AO to that range and see it clearly without further adjustment, especially with front adjusting AO.  I wish both of these companies could figure out a way to get side AO and keep the prices down...lol.\n\nThe eye relief on this is a little over 4 inches down to a little over three...perfect for quick acquisition.  This one really shocked me, along with the clarity of the optics for such a cheap scope.  I will be able to offset mount my red dot in front of this once i get my quad rail.  Long eye relief on the scope really opens up the weak eye field of view for quick target aquisition.  Advantage, leapers. Okay, the Centerpoint isn't a CQB scope, so sue me.  Quick aquisition is still nice for deer hunting if one pops out in front of you.  In fact this one may end up on my .308 next deer season for that reason.  Never hurts to be ready.\n\nAnyway, i don't want to send the wrong message about the UTG. It is a fine scope, worth WAY more than 74 bucks.  The rings on this thing are QD and extremely heavy duty.  I haven't taken them off to see if they maintain zero, but i will when i get my quad rail.  I don't have any need to do that at the moment.  I'll amend the review if the zero changes.  If not call it good.  So, one faulty lens cap...which i may contact utg about to test their customer service...and tight controls (which i expect to loosen over time, so how bad is that really?)  All in all, I find the UTG new generation compact CQB scope to be a real winner.  I am betting utg sends me a new cap for free and all is well.\n\nDon't believe everything you read (including this)...step out and find out for yourself.  Shooting on a budget makes it fun for more people.  Hats off to UTG (and centerpoint...by Crossman) for bringing quality to the masses.";What about UTG?
11;3.0;3.0;118.0;I have had this product for two years. It has been mounted on both a .22 LR rifle, as well as a .22 caliber air rifle (spring powered). In my time with this scope, I have identified a few pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n-The scope is well built and durable. After 2 years of regular and rugged use, I have never encountered any function issues with the scope or the QD rings. In addition to regular knocks, jolts, and scrapes, it is able to withstand the recoil of a spring powered air rifle (the bilateral forces of a spring piston are notorious for destroying good firearm scopes).\n-The optics are clear, and more than acceptable for the price point.\n-The adjustable objective and magnification settings are very user friendly.\n\nCons:\n-Due to the compact size of this scope and its limited eye relief, I have never been able to shoot from a relaxed shooting stance. Regardless of the host of this scope, I have always found myself uncomfortable with how far I have to lean in to get proper eye relief.\n\nSummary: The quality of the scope is more than satisfactory. I have put the scope through a lot, and it has never let me down. And, due to the limited eye relief and compact nature of the scope, it has really never been quite right for me. If I could go back, I would have gotten the full length 3-9X from the same manufacturer.\n\nAdditional Note: I have never felt the need to use the illuminated reticle feature, and consequently cannot comment on the function of this feature. Rest assured however, the scope functions just fine without a battery.;2 Year Review
3;4.0;3.0;5.0;"I wrote what I felt was a very well thought out and honest review for this scope yesterday but after submitting apparently Gremlins ate my review so here it is in a nut shell....\n\nThis ended up longer than intended but hopefully it helps someone.\n\nIntended use was as a budget optic set up combined with a side mount base for Soviet designed carbines. If you're interested you can find that in my reviews.\n\nI've used UTG optics a few times over the years so I'm more than passingly familiar with them. To be fair this is the first I've ever bought intentionally, the others came in deals or on other rifles. UTG optics in a nutshell are well they just ""are"". For what it's worth my scopes run from old Weaver, Denver Colorado Redfield, Leupold, new Redfield made by Leupold, Kahles, Schmidt & Bender, Ziess, Hendsolt, Bushnell XXXX Elites, etc etc etc. In other words yes I've used budget optics however I tend to spend a little more than the average guy due to my personal needs. Now with all that said I'm not against budget optics however I do know the difference and can quantifiably compare should I choose to and it's not arrogance or wishful thinking. I spend for quality where I need it and enough quality where I don't. As I get older and eyesight isn't what it used to be my needs for quality keep increasing so I have a different perspective than I would have at 20 with insane eyesight! That may be of interest to some...\n\nInitial thoughts:\nYup it's a UTG but let's not be hasty. Over at the build quality looks good for the money.\nOh look it came with two batteries!!! Yay!!! Score me!!!!\nOk rings, the rings are pretty nice for non locking rings. They appear pretty stout and not cheap. I do like that they're adjustable, I like that a lot.\nIllumination in my well lit kitchen is pretty dang bright, maybe even daylight capable although that's not necessary.\n\nI mounted the scope into the supplied rings and mounted on the side mount rail I also bought. This went painlessly and without issue. Rings adjusted nicely too for the rail quite well. I'm very pleased with that even though they're not locking rings.\n\nAt the range:\nScope zero'd pretty fast even though I had to crank the windage virtually all the way right. I'm unsure of if this was a rail issue or scope although to be fair I suspect rail so I won't judge that against the scope.\nScope was clear and bright during the bright afternoon sun (1200-1500) but to be fair a Coke bottle is clear and bright with this type of lighting. You don't really notice the difference until the light gets to fading. I didn't spend enough time out in the single digits under dressed to check low light abilities.\n\nMagnification adjustment full on sucked!!! Way super tight. Had to take off my gloves and fight it to go from 3-9X. Inexcusable how tight it was. This might not matter to warm weather shooters but when you live in a place where sub zero is normal in the winter yeah it kind of matters. Besides there's no reason for the magnification to be so insanely tight and hard to turn.\nEye relief at 3X was pretty forgiving but at 9X typical of budget optics it gets downright bitchy about being perfectly aligned. I spent too much time hunting for the circle of light in the black for my patience. Again it's Budget optic so that's generally typical though.\nAdjustable objective was a little touchy for my likes but cleared up the target at 50y pretty well. It could be a little less abrupt on the changes but it's sufficiently functional.\n\nScope zero'd easily and held zero over two trips to the range. Oh the turrets those moved like a dream!!! Smooth and clean sharp clicks I felt they my gloves. Beautifully executed!!! The magnification adjustment should move like the windage and elevation adjustment did.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nAll in all scope did well however that magnification adjustment is just unforgivable in today's world. I might not complain if it was a $20 optic but twenty years ago a $20 optic would put this thing to shame. Yes it would because I gave away my $20 new Simon's Deerfield 3-9X that I bought 20+years ago and it's still going strong for it's new owner. UTG should be at a point of refining their optics and quality control now not shipping out items the user has to live with for the money.\n\nNow to be fair the scope does pack some nice features for the money and those turrets are frickin beautiful!!!!\n\nSo with all that said it's a solid 3 Star scope that could've been a 4 Star with really nice rings (for the money) and great illumination, but for that overly tight magnification ring.\nIf you can buy better I would but if you can't then it'll do it's job.\n\nI'll keep the scope and run it as a fixed power optic for now until I run across someone who needs a scope then I'll pass it on for free more than likely after I upgrade it to something better. Likely a VX1 and leave the budget optics to the folks that can live with that they live with.\n\nAnd no... This UTG is not just as good as other brands costing several times the money, but maybe you just need failing eyesight to be able to see that.\n\nAlso I did not use this scope on known highly ACCURATE rifles to see just how tight of a zero it holds. I may and update my review but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for me to have to rezero a scope that I value the ammo more than the scope over.\n\nIf my review was helpful please click yes if it wasn't then by all means please click no!!! There's way to many junk reviews that give absolutely no relevant information on Amazon and I hate sorting thru then so to find a Nugget review it two. Let's help each other and hello Amazon keep the good reviews and can the craptastic ones!";It's a UTG not a VX series. Judge accordingly.

The sealing tape wasn't sealed, so I don't know if it was a return or not (which bothers me a bit). The scope itself looks new. It came with a nice cleaning cloth and two batteries. First thing I did was loosely set the scope in the mounts (on a table), roughly centered on the two tube sections, and installed the top mounts finger tight. I set my pistol in the vice, set the mounts on it and aligned them in a roughly centered section on my receiver. I closed my eyes, raised the gun to firing position, and opened them. After two repeat adjustments the eye relief (which is generous...a bit over 4"" at a guess) was perfect with the rear mount in the fifth slot forward. I locked the mounts forward in their slots for recoil, and tightened the quick connects (the mounts are very solid). I then put the gun back in the vice, and leveled it.\n\nNow, this is the part that lost the sight a star already. I have always mounted scopes by leveling the top turret to the rail. I then verify this by checking the reticle against a level mark on the wall. One always equals the other. This gun has a slightly canted reticle (just a few degrees off, but it's off). The UTG instructions ignore leveling the top post (which is ignorant in the extreme in my opinion), and ONLY instruct you to level the reticle. This is counter to every other scope manufacturer on the planet, and honestly it bothers me more than a bit.\n\nThat said, the scope's clarity is wonderful. I can get it to focus clearly at as close as 1yd (at lower magnifications), and the distance clarity is excellent as well.\n\nThis scope was bought to replace a CVLife 3-9x32 unit which had a HORRIBLY short eye relief. It's mounted to an AR15 pistol with a 12.5"" barrel, chambered in 6.5 Grendel. I'll definitely be updating this weekend once I get some rounds put through it, and will also get some video of the scope functions including the turrets, as well as the colored reticles.\n\n11/04/16 - I made a video today going over the scope, then took my pistol out to sight it in. Started at 25yds, adjusted it to center, then dropped back to 50yds. The scope was easy to adjust, and seemed to work well enough. Later I'll set it up with a 200yd zero using 123 grain Hornady SST ballistic tips...but for now I just wanted to get it shooting the Wolf 100 grain FMJBT I have on hand. Final result was about 2.5MOA...but keep in mind this was in no way the scope's fault. It's on a pistol, using very inconsistent steel case ball ammunition. Average fps was over 10 shots was 2400, but the variance was as much as 60fps (2380-2440).\n\nAnyhow, I'll update later if I run into any issues. I'd still give the scope a solid 4 at this point. The slight cant of the reticle wasn't much of a factor in use. More a sign of poor quality control than anything else in my opinion.";So far, a decent value.
79;6.0;1.0;161.0;"This item arrived today, and I set about mounting it to my rifle. My first impression is tentatively good. I'm not positive, but it appears that the reticle is tilted relative to the X-Y axis of the adjustment turrets by about 5 degrees or so. This would cause a slight shift in elevation when adjusting windage, and a slight change in windage when adjusting elevation. I must caution that this is how it appears to be at first glance, but that it may prove to be correctly aligned when I have a change to take it to the range and sight it in. I used a Wheeler Engineering scope mounting kit that comes with a torque driver, and some spirit levels to ensure the scope turrets are square with the rifle's receiver, so I know that the apparent tilt in the reticle cannot be caused by the scope being misaligned in the rings.\n\nThe rest of the scope appears to be a solid, well built unit. I like the locking turrets. The turret click adjustments were positive, and there was plenty of tactile and audible feedback. I liked the locking feature of the turrets, but I will have a better idea of the zero reset feature after I sight it in. The supplied rings feel solid, but time will tell how they hold up. I used medium strength thread locker to secure the scope rings, and torqued them to approximately 15 inch-pounds. The rings had a non-slip liner in them to help keep the scope in place under recoil. If the scope can be removed and replaced on the rifle and still hold zero I will be duly impressed by the rings. The scope shipped with hex wrenches for the rings, and for the turrets. It also came with a lens cleaning cloth, and two lithium button cells (one, and a spare) for the reticle illumination.\n\nThe reticle illumination washes out in daylight, even on an overcast day. This will be most useful at dusk or during extremely dark or stormy conditions. Most shooters will probably leave the reticle illumination off, as will I. It is a nice feature to have, but not one that will make much of a difference for the vast majority of shooting conditions. Most states do not allow hunting in the dark, and most competitive shooting matches are daylight matches as well.\n\nLike other reviewers, I thought the lens covers left something to be desired. The objective lens rotates to adjust parallax, so you have to remove and replace the cover every time you adjust for a different range. And the ocular lens cap is loose fitting. This scope would be better served with standard (photography lens) sized threads so that clear camera lens filters can be screwed onto the lenses to protect them. This way the user can leave the lens caps on all the time, and replace them if they get scratched or damaged.\n\nThe instruction manual was well written, but it can be a bit confusing because it is designed to cover a wide range of different optics. So the purchaser will have to filter through and find the information relevant to their particular model. This particular scope is 3-9X magnification with a range estimating mil-dot reticle. In order to accurately estimate range, you need to have the scope set to the proper magnification (this is different for each scope model). The manual suggests that this magnification is written on a supplied ranging card. The scope did come with a card, but I could not find anywhere on the card that says, ""use this scope at XXX magnification for range estimation"". I sent Leapers/UTG a customer service request asking for clarification, so this will be an opportunity to see how their customer service dept. performs.\n\nI gave the scope a 3 star review for the apparently tilted reticle, and the omission of range estimation magnification from the instructions. If their customer service gets back to me promptly with an answer, and it turns out the reticle tilt is just an optical illusion I will upgrade the rating accordingly.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI've decided to return this unit for a replacement. I attempted to bore sight the scope using a Leupold bore sight device, and when the scope is ""zeroed"" on the bore sight device, changing the elevation adjustment causes a slight change in the windage, just as I expected. So it isn't just my imagination, the reticle is indeed off axis a few degrees. Amazon makes returns easy, and already has a replacement scheduled to arrive in a couple of days. I'm hoping the replacement scope has no issues. I'll update again when the replacement arrives. (See the customer images above for a picture of the reticle.)\n\nUPDATE 2:\n\nWell, Leapers never got back to me. The replacement scope arrived today from Amazon, with another tilted reticle. In an optimistic mood, I ordered a second one of these hoping to get 2 good units. BOTH the replacement, AND the second one have problems right out of the box. The replacement had another tilted reticle and the other one's elevation adjustment doesn't work. It clicks like it is supposed to, but the reticle doesn't move.\n\nI'm done buying UTG optics.";Never again! 3-9X CQB scope - updated
48;7.0;2.0;111.0;"I read quite a few of the 370+ reviews of this scope here on Amazon and I took a chance. The concerns I had were about getting one with a tilted reticule (not a big issue due to how easy it is to return) and optical clarity.\n\nReticule - no issues, straight as it should be\nOptical clarity - very good. No it is not Nikon or Leupold but it is very good. Some distortion at the edge of the view but you really have to concentrate to see them.\n\nI like how compact it is, less than 2/3 of my Nikon Prostaff 3x9 BDC. The cross-hair is rather on the thick side but not to the point where it becomes an issue.\n\nI don't care about the illumination feature; you cannot see it in full daylight even at max and I wish they had a model without this feature. It would be even more lightweight and compact.\n\nThe turrets track perfectly. POI was 6"" at 100 yards, 24 clicks down and it was right on.\n\nI have this scope on a SIG 556R (7.62x39). The rifle doesn't have much of recoil to speak about (heavy and a muzzle brake) but the scope looks like it can take serious recoil.\n\nThe QD rings are OK but the QD levers became loose after about 600 rounds and I had to re-tighten them. Replacing them with the high profile UTG rings with butterfly wing-nuts. The rings that come with the scope are medium height and don't leave enough clearance for BUIS under the scope.\n\nBottom line: this is a lot of value for the price. With this being offered I don't see any reason to spend hundreds on big name tactical scopes to shoot at the range.\n\nSee the picture I uploaded: 20 rounds at 100 yards, 7.62x39 with SIG 556R, rapid fire (as quick as I was reacquiring the target), using a bipod, Wolf WPA ammo. For tactical scopes, I think it is as good as it gets.\n\nEDIT: I initially gave this 5 stars since I considered to be a lot of value for the price. After about 600 rounds the windage turret stopped working - clicks but the reticule doesn't track. Returning it and getting a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nikon-P-223-3x32-Matte-BDC-Carbine/dp/B006Z07JTE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nikon P-223 3x32 Matte BDC Carbine</a>. The UTG would be a very good scope if you get one that keeps working as designed but it appears that its quality is hit or miss. I thought I could prove wrong those saying that with optics you get what you pay for but I was the one proven wrong. I'll stay with tried and true which for me is Nikon.";Initially great but it didn't last
85;8.0;5.0;122.0;"I purchased this scope to be able to fill the bill as a gp scope for my rifles.  I must say it has been a sweet suprise how effective this little gem is.  I originaly mounted it on my break open .22 air rifle for plinking squirrels and rabits around my house.  Did a great job.  Went to range with my big guns (7.62x54r Romak 3, 7.62x39 AK & SKS, 30-06 Remington bolt action hunting rifle.  While at the range I noticed that my regular, High end Z---s Scope wouldn't hold zero. I had brought this little sucker along as a ""Just in case"" switch out. I used the quick disconnect feature and mounted it on each rifle individualy so my trip wasn't waisted and I could test out my hand loads. I was truely impressed. Didn't think it would be up to the recoil of my 30-06 but was wrong.  Held up like a champ. Think I will buy 4 of these things and put one on each of my rifles.  I can buy 9 of these and still have money for shipping compared to what I paid for my main hunting Scope.";Tack Driver of a deal!
18;9.0;5.0;32.0;First off, due to the popularity of this scope, there are cheap clones out there for less. AVOID THEM! Many of the reviews you may read here where the battery cover falls off or the reticle is canted, etc. may be related to the buyer unknowingly getting one of these cheap clones.  I have used mine extensively for over a year now and am continued to be amazed at the performance of this optic. Price aside, this scope has been almost flawless mounted on a AK47, and has now passed 1500 rounds. This gun is used primarily for hog hunting and control on our ranch and gets abused just like any other ranch tool. I expect it to provide first shot accuracy every time and it has consistently delivered. The gun gets used by me as well as the hands and by every guest to the ranch. The scope has been praised by every person that has used the gun, including some very impressive professional shooters, hunters, and military personnel. One ex-military sniper who is by far the most knowledgeable person I know about guns and optics as well as the best shot I have ever seen, actually refused to believe that this scope was a UTG for under $100. He claimed it was the first time he actually enjoyed shooting an AK, which was fine with me as I got to hunt with his custom Colt AR.\nIt is also important that you take the time to set up this scope properly as you would with any scope. The scope needs to be mounted carefully in the right spot on the gun and securely or else you will have view/parallax problems. Get some help with this if you are not sure how this needs to be done.\n\nPositives:\nCompact - light weight\nOutstanding optics - nothing comes close for less than $1000\nExcellent battery life - original battery still going strong\nDurable - we use guns as tools and it has held up well\nReliable - holds adjustments over time\nEasily adjustable - positive adjustments\n\nNegatives:\nCrosshairs get fuzzy at high intensity settings\n\nIn summary, buy this from a reputable source and install it properly and you should be delighted with this scope.;Greatly Exceeded My Expectations
5;10.0;5.0;22.0;"Have this mounted atop my factory bushmaster .223, no mods at all on this weapon. This replaces a worthless red dot, hated that thing with a passion. Took it to the range last week, zeroed at 50 yds and put out 10, 4.5"" clays. Hit them 15 times of 15 shots, so you know by the end I was shooting at tiny pieces left from the first shots. This at 50 yards. However I went back yesterday to try it out longer range. Started with 100 yds, only change needed was 1 mil left. Skipped 200 and went to 300. So here's where the fun began. I had NO dope on this scope and my guesses at mils needed were based upon my dope from my .308 based in MOA. This being a MUCH lighter round I was using an ""educated"" guess at what I needed. What round you ask? Monarch 55 grain off the shelf from Academy Sports at $7/box. So, I allowed myself 5 shots to get on target, then 5 shots to test repeat ability. Surprisingly my guesses were all VERY close, the only one off was actually 300 yds. I started at 4.5 mils and came back down to 4.1. 400 and 500 I hit on the money first shot out. Well, I must say I was impressed, not at my guesses but at the scope. I shot at 300, 400, and 500 yards. At 300 and 400 I hit 5 of 5. At 500 I hit 3 of 5, I missed the first 2 just high right and left. My fault, nothing else. The last 3 had the 10"" gong swinging in the wind. At 300 I went up 4.1 mils, at 400 up 8 mils, at 500 up 13 mils with more left in the scope. Took me less than 30 minutes to shoot all 3 distances. That's all based off the 50 yd zero, and still only 1 mil left at all those ranges with the cheapest .223 ammo you can get off the shelf. I used to hate shooting this rifle, the red dot was a royal PITA. Couldn't hit a clay at 50 yds to save ur tookus! Now it's almost impossible to miss! It's also a whole lot cheaper to shoot than my .308, but that will still be used for the 1000 yards shots.....maybe. I'm gonna have to give it a go, I just have to now. Tho seeing that target at 500 was tough, not sure if I'll be able to see it at 1000. Eye relief at 3 power is awesome, gets a bit tight at 9, but collapsing the stock about 1/2 way gets you right in there consistently. No tighter than my 6-24 at full power tho. Only thing I have yet to check is to set it back to my 50 yd zero and get after some more clays. I'm guessing it will be perfect. So, bottom line is I love this scope! for the price you absolutely can't beat it. Kinda like the $139 6-24x44 I have atop my .308 that reaches out to 1000 yds consistently. You don't have to spend a fortune to get there. I shoot 1000 yds with an $800 off the shelf setup, including the glass! $800 total cost, NO mods done to the rifle other than changing the scope base from 0 to 20 moa, and adding a $17 muzzle break. It can be done, I'm proof. My Bushmaster .223 cost more than my entire 1000 yd .308 setup! But now it's a bad a$$ 500+ yd shooter. Mikey likey!";Serious 500+ yd shooter with more left atop AR-15 with monarch 55 gr off the shelf ammo
74;11.0;5.0;62.0;I did a lot of research on different scopes for a budget build for my Smith & Wesson M&P 15 5.56. I decided on this one from Amazon after considering the pro's and con's on the reviews and the cost of the scope. I ordered the scope on 6/24/12 and it arrived on 6/26/12, 2 days, with no extra special shipping arrangements. First thing I'd suggest is reading the manual until you understand the instructions since the manual covers more then one type of scope. One thing the instructions doesn't cover is leveling the mounting platform and leveling the scope during installation. Two cheap line levels will do the trick. Also, I'd suggest a little blue Locktite to keep everything secure. Everything on the scope arrived in perfect condition, no complaints there. Proper mounting of the scope made the initial sight in process a breeze. I did purchase a medium 1/2 inch riser for the rail. The scope QD rings sits low on the rail so if you have a magpul iron site, the 1/2 inch riser is perfect to fit the scope over the iron sight and still provide excellent eye relief. The scopes QD is great if you want to access your iron sights in a hurry. Remember, the boresighter process is for the initial sight in and not intended for zeroing. You just want to be able to hit the paper, then go to the range and fine tune the sight in to achieve zeroing. This scope has performed better then expected and in my opinion is worth more then the $80 it cost. If you're doing a budget build this is the scope to buy. Please, this is my opinion considering my own experience with this scope. Others will have different views so read all the reviews and make up your own mind.;Good Purchase For The Money From Amazon

8;13.0;5.0;13.0;This is the perfect scope for a Rugerr 10/22 take down. The scope is the perfect length and if mounted properly it lines up with the very end of the receiver portion of the rifle when taken apart. It also fits nice and tight in the gun bag. Note, it will not mount properly with the useless Ruger rail that comes with the tactical version of the rifle. I mounted it on the rail mount listed below and I am really happy with how well it works.\nRuger 10/22 Long See-Through Scope Mount -...\nMSP;This is the perfect scope for a Rugerr 10/22 take down
13;14.0;5.0;13.0;This scope is amazing, so amazing that I'd rather have this one over an ACOG, I used to be an ACOG fanboy but I've come to conclusion they are very overrated and unless you want to use you rifle optics as a hammer (which with the ACOG I'm sure you could and it would be fine because they are durable) the UTG is the way to go. I've had the opportunity to use the classic 4x32 and it was nice but you pay ~$1200 and you are limited to just 4x, the UTG you have 3-9x and you can adjust the eye relief, a smaller point between the two is the mounts, the UTG is quick release levers that hold tight, the ACOG has the hand screws that hold just as tight but takes just a little longer to put on and take off, not a big deal but it is a perk of the UTG. The illumination is with red OR green on the ACOG, you get both on the UTG, I will say not having to change batteries with the ACOG would be nice but an the UTG you can adjust the cross hair brightness with a dimmer switch like function unlike most scopes and red dots that have hard settings. This scope works without batteries too, it works just like any other scopes that have black cross hairs. The scope covers are solid and you don't need to take them completely off to shoot I will say the front one doesn't fit that well with the shade extension, or if you adjust the eye relief, the scope cover rotates with it but you can just take it off so not a big deal. I've put 200 rounds over 2 separate trips to the range through my Rock River Arms AR 15 and it's held 0 flawlessly, I even fumbled the rifle with the scope on it (it landed on the table and not the ground thank god) and even after that it held zero. I'm sure I'm missing some talking points but oh well. You can't get a better scope under $100, I picked mine up for $64 and some change on Amazon. On another note, Amazon had this scope cheaper than anywhere else I looked at.;Can't beat it with a stick.
65;15.0;5.0;28.0;Not gonna lie but i bought thIs scope thinking it was a piece but honestly it is way more than that. This scope performs like a $200+ scope to be ferfectly honest. I shoot .223 and .22 with it and i can not lOse my zero no matter how hard i try. I have also beat it up a little bit and it still performs. The illuminated sights are amazing for low light coyote hunting as well. Another plus is mine cane with a quick range chart that has been very helpful to me. Will be buying more for future rifles.;Best scope for best price
1;16.0;5.0;29.0;I've been looking at different scopes for the past two months and finally came accross this scope. This scope is durable, pretty on the rifle (Tactical Mini 14), cheap, and has just enough power to see anything down range. For my purpose, target shooting, it's perfect. As of far no problems and I couldn't have gotten a better deal on this scope. I recommend this scope to any range shooter.;Well Worth the Price
30;17.0;5.0;17.0;I am very happy with this scope.  It didn't cost a whole lot but it is very well made, easy to operate, and it has a lot of helpful options.  Have had it out to the range twice now.  Have had no quality or breakage issues with it that some of the other buyers have mentioned.  I am not very experienced using optics of any type on rifles.  Even with my relative lack of experience I was able to zero this in at 50 yards and then do fairly well out to 100 yards on an AK47.  I've put over 200 rounds through the rifle since I installed this scope on it.  I have seen no problems with it handling the recoil from 7.62x39.  I struggled a little bit with cheek weld and how the scope was mounted on my rifle.  I have since changed out the scope rings and brought it closer to my eye.  Plan on taking it out again and see if I'm better at 100 yards with the new mount set up.;Extremely Pleased with Scope
4;18.0;3.0;5.0;First off, holy cow this scope is nifty. Red/green lit reticle, tool-less adjustment, and variable zoom and focus are strong selling points at this price range.\nHOWEVER, as others have posted, the sight hairs on the one I received are tilted by about 2, which is why I am going to send this back for a replacement. I have owned scopes that have this issue, and adjusting them is a two steps forward, one step back deal. In my case, if you lower the elevation, you have to also adjust the windage, which makes it more of a hastle than it is worth.\nI live on a large section of land in the mountains, so quick and accurate adjuatments are crucial.\nI will post back with a four-star review and updates if Leapers sends me one that has been properly QC'ed.;Cool scope, but crooked sight hairs.
46;19.0;4.0;20.0;Pros:\nNo, this scope is not made in the USA, but the quality seems to be pretty good for a non-American product. By having the scope made outside of the US, the price is brought down. The quality of UTG Leapers products is definitely better than NC-Star products. I bought this to mount on a 5.56/2.23 rifle. The scope held up great at the range and the glass didn't fall apart due to the recoil. The scope is supposedly nitrogen-filled, rain proof, fog proof, and shock proof like you would expect for any half-decent scope.\n\nBecause this scope has external windage and elevation knobs, the locking ring features come in handy for keeping your zero when transporting your rifle in a case. The magnification ring is a bit stiff, but that's a lot better than having a loose magnification ring. If you. The scope does have a reticle that can be illuminated but the good thing is that you don't have to use the illumination.\n\nIf you buy this scope, keep in mind that it uses a second focal plane mil-dot reticle. This means that if you want to do range estimation, you have to use a modified mil-dot formula. First, you use the standard mil-dot formula for 10X magnfication to get a preliminary range. You then take this range and multiply it by your actual scope magnification and then divide by 10 to get your true range.\n\nCons:\nThe scope rings that come with the package have these quick detach levers. The levers seem to be slightly loose, but I haven't had problems yet...\n\nAlso, the dust cover for the front objective lens is too loose if you also install the sunshade. If you want to use the sunshade, I recommend wrapping the front of the sunshade with some black electrical tape so that the dust cover will fit on more snugly.;Great Affordable Scope
27;20.0;5.0;14.0;"Some people have complained about a tilted reticle, I did not experience this so hopefully UTG corrected this problem. The scope itself feels very durable and well made. The variable power adjustment ring and front AO are pretty stiff which is nice. The w/e turrets have a very positive click and have locking rings. Another cool feature is that the turrets are zero resetting, meaning that once you set it to zero you can undo the top allen screw and reset it to the ""0"" position so that any future adjustments can be visualized and returned to 0. The rings that came with the scope are very solid  however, I ordered a pair of the QD high rise rings to lift the scope up to accommodate Magpul sights. The eye relief is pretty good at between 4""-5"" and for my AR set up it is perfect. The scope also came with two CR 1620 button batteries for the reticle illumination. The illumination is nice and I could see its use for low light or dark contrast targets but I don't ever see myself using this feature. The optics are very clear and crisp for this price scope! The flip up lens caps are nice but they are slightly bulky and the rear one does not fit with the MBUS under it so I will have to find another cap option\n\nOverall the scope is very well made and seems to be an amazing value for the price. I would definitely recommend this item for those who do not want to spend a ton of money on a scope, but want something that is decent quality. It mounted to my rifle fairly easily and I will be testing it soon so I will provide an update once I have it zeroed and am confident that it holds.";Amazing quality for the price!
15;21.0;4.0;10.0;"OK, so I am the original skeptic when it comes to glowing reviews of, well, pretty much anything! I bought the UTG BugBuster scope for a cheap .22 build and really didn't expect much, I mean really, how good can a $70 rifle scope be?\n\nFirst, The Good:\n\nRight out of the box the scope felt solid, the included rings and sun shade fit perfectly, the flip-up lens covers worked well (though you have to do without the front flip-up if you run the sun shade), the fit & finish was very good, and the QD rings do a great job of returning to center when you remove and re-install them (I've used them on other builds). There were two batteries included for the lit reticle (one spare) and the red and green lights worked very well ramping up and down as designed. I started off by centering the scope using a mirror and a strong light (if you don't know how watch the YouTube video by Leapers UTG) which took a couple of minutes then mounted and leveled the scope on my rifle. I took the rifle to my range expecting to need an extended sighting in period, fired 3 rounds offhand at 10 meters then an additional 7 rounds from a rest at 25 meters, all were in the black with the 7 from the bench rest making one hole ... all with no adjustment to the scope (see the attached photo). So how good can a $70 scope be? Pretty darn good!\n\nNow for The Bad:\n\nNo, I can't say this scope will compete with my Nikons and Leupolds but then it was less than 1/4 their cost. First off, when I centered the scope I noticed the crosshairs were slightly rotated (about 1 degree). By running the cross hairs up & down and left & right while watching in the mirror, I determined that while they were rotated slightly they tracked true with the adjustment knobs. When I mounted the scope, I leveled the cross hairs not the adjustment knobs which resulted in a slight cant to the scope. While sighting the rifle in I found that the Adjustable Objective scale was off slightly but then I normally make that adjustment while looking through the scope so it didn't bother me. The peripheral aberration (that blurring around the edges) is fairly pronounced at close ranges but for what this scope is intended for it is acceptable. While the adjustment knobs are tight with the ""lock rings"" turned in, they are a bit sloppy when in ""adustment"" mode but again, not a deal breaker.\n\nOverall Impression:\n\nFor the money, this is an excellent scope. I would recommend it for a casual plinker or close in (less than 75 yards) small game rimfire rifle but I'm not sure how it would handle the recoil of a centerfire. Buy one, set it up properly, get some ammunition, and get out on the range!";pretty much anything
76;22.0;1.0;22.0;This scope was very nice out of the box.  I mounted it to my AR-15 and it looked great.  It also functioned great just looking through it.  However, it was a different story at the range.  It took me an hour to get it close to sighted in an about 100 rounds were wasted.  The elevation knob moved the reticle slightly up and down, and, the windage knob moved the reticle grossly up and down.  The reticle was slightly off axis (maybe just 2 degrees or so).  It's clear to me now that this type of scope would be best used for an air soft gun or something.  It looks great but performed horribly.  I read a lot of the other negative reviews but I thought these were written from picky marksmen.  I am new to this stuff but it was quite frustrating and ridiculous.  I am sending it back and I am not willing to take my chances that another one won't come in defective as well.  I guess you really do have to spend more than $70-85 on a scope.\n\nPlease take it from this amateur, this scope would be great on a toy, but not an actual rifle in which you are trying to get precision groupings.  I eventually got on my paper targets but this was still not consistent.;defective

28;24.0;4.0;12.0;My expectations were low based on the price (I'll admit it, I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to rifle scopes...I usually mount Leupold VX-II scopes on my rifles.)  I was pleasantly surprised by this scope.\n\nI purchased it for use on a flat-top AR-15 carbine, but to try it out, I mounted the scope on a series of Remington 700 rifles. I figured that if I was going to break it, I might as well do it right off the bat. Sixty rounds of 180gr 30-06 hunting loads, thirty rounds of 168gr 308 Win target loads, thirty rounds of 80gr 223 Rem target loads, and finally another five rounds on the 30-06.  I was able to re-adjust the scope back to the zero settings I wrote down for each rifle and the point of impact was right on.\n\nDiopter adjustment works as does the objective focus.  Both are a bit stiff to turn, perhaps it will loosen up over time.  The scale on the objective adjustment is off by quite a bit. For example, focusing on the target at 100 yards and the scale shows the yardage between the 25 and 50 yard hash marks.  Only detractor is the edges of the image are just slightly out of focus compared to the center of the image.\n\nTurret markings are good.  Adding and removing MOA via the turrets indeed shifts the point of impact the correct distance.  I did not see any problems with the windage changing with elevation changes.  I have not tried to compute adjustments using the mil dots on the recticle yet, I'll leave that for another day, perhaps next week when temps drop below freezing again to also see if the scope has any issues with fogging.\n\nAll around, a good scope for a shooter on a tight budget.;Good low budget rifle scope
43;25.0;1.0;15.0;I tried two of these after the first one decided it could not handle the recoil of a 300 Blackout, and went out of focus permanently. The second one just ruined a Blacktail deer hunt with my son and I here in rainy Oregon. After one half day of hunting in the rain this scoped fogged inside, and after one week still has fog. Tried calling UTG for a warranty repair which says you have to PAY for, and no one at UTG will answer the phones in the middle of the day eastern time on a Friday. No way can I recommend these scopes, and I have replaced them with Bushnell Banner dusk to dawn scopes, or Vortex scopes. Vortex has a great warranty, and after a full two days in the rain is still fog free. I cant say much about the Bushnell's yet because I have not put them through the rigors of the northwest, but they do offer a lifetime warranty, and someone answers the phone.;No way can I recommend these scopes

After a few times of this I took it off, re-boxed it and sent it back.  On a related side note, I love Amazon and the ability to return stuff as soon as we figure out that it's junk.;you'll be happy you did

The only things im not pleased about and why i docked a star is its very heavy.  The other issue is that I hit the end of the windage adjustment and the set screw popped over something inside, well i had to take it apart to get it working again.  My friend has one and his did the same thing.  Just be careful with the adjustments, if you hit the end you may not be able to move it anymore without taking it apart, and re aligning the set screw;Compact, clear picture, ao, cool scope

I have it mounted on an S&W M&P 15-22 on a low profile UTG riser and couldn't be happier.\n\nI was a little concerned with reviews mentioning issues with the reticle being off-axis but I didn't experience that. One of the things I did to eliminate this a being a possible problem during installation was to place a level on the Picatinny rail and level the rifle before tightening the ring screws to clamp the scope. I then aligned the reticle vertical axis with a known true vertical structure and carefully tightened and torqued the screws down equally and evenly on opposing corners of the clamps (left-forward, right-rear, left-rear, right-forward) doing the same on both rings at the same time to ensure I didn't torque/twist the  tube. Once the screws were all tight I verified the vertical reticle line was still aligned to the structure.\n\nAt the range most of my shooting is going to be at 25 yards, which is the distance I zeroed in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/UTG-3-9x32-Compact-CQB-Bug-Buster-AO-RGB-Scope-with-Med-Picatinny-Rings-2-Sunshade/dp/B005UGIMNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">UTG 3-9x32 Compact CQB Bug Buster AO RGB Scope with Med.

I then shot one shot at 25 yards at each circle to test for accuracy and alignment. All shots were in the circle and 25% were either in or touching the bullseye. I put another 250 rounds down range all with nice, tight groupings.\n\nI must say, I'm a very happy camper with the scope and how easy is was to set it up!

61;30.0;5.0;16.0;Mounted with UTG 978 side mount on IO AK47, Sighted with bore laser(50 yd), Horizontal set out of box, minor vertical adjustment took about 5 minutes. At the range 5 rounds and I was eating the center of the target.  Held zero the rest of the day (150-200 rounds).  Set up, mounting, and adjustment straight forward when instructions are followed. Friend has one on his AK and it works great, buying one for his M&P 15. Looks great on rifle, though does add a bit of weight.  Eye relief about 3-4 inches. Bright picture, good field of view.  The lighted recitals are bright, both red and green adjust well for light conditions, off/black fine for bright sunlight.  Next time out may try it at 100 yd, it is an AK, so we'll see.

9;31.0;4.0;7.0;"Based on my experience  mounted on an AR platform with picatinny rail:\nPros: Very reasonable price; compact size; comes with detachable QD rings, sunshade and lens covers different color and brightness reticles for those that need a contrast under various light conditions; easy elevation/windage adjustments and stays zeroed after multiple removals. AO is a bonus for shooting various distances at one station.\nCons: a chunky, heavy scope; poor eye relief that results in the fish-eye effect and is rather annoying; I believe it may require taller rings depending on the type of mount and stock drop in order to eliminate this malady.  The eye piece centers over the charging handle and requires needle-nose fingers or a ""devils-claw"" hook to work the bolt.  The red and green reticle does fade in bright light,\n\nI would recommend this optic as a very good entry level scope for anyone on a limited budget who does not care about the weight or looks.

39;32.0;5.0;12.0;I'll attempt to keep this short, and let my pictures do some of the work. Now, granted, accuracy is a balance thing that relies on the shooter and firearm involved more than the sighting arrangement, but it would be foolish to discount the sights involved. Speaking of which, this scope is awesome. It will do what a good deal of higher dollar scopes will do, and you can get it for under a hundred bucks. That, to me, is very hard to beat. Now, it is no high end Leupold, but it'll do the job superbly. I'm no long range sharpshooter either and I'm not keen on all the specifics and details about scopes. I am an experienced shooter (20+ Years), and like stuff that is simple, works, and stuff that I can get at a good price. This scope is just that, so long as you have the correct philosophy of use in mind, which, with this scope, is short to medium range shooting, which you *could* squeeze into a longer ranged role in a pinch. Slap it on your AR and you'd be ready for most situations where an AR is appropriate, within reason.;Excllent Low Cost Optic.
10;33.0;4.0;7.0;Pretty good scope. The illumination feature seems a bit gimmicky to me. Pretty cool looking but I'm not sure how much use it is. Any setting above about 25% kinda bleeds and get blurry. Also seems like it causes my eyes to dilate and the target gets dark. I can imagine on a higher quality scope that the illumination would be a nice thing, but on this one I just don't find myself using it.\n\nOtherwise the parallax adjustment is great, the focus is REALLY good, the magnification is great, the etched glass cross hairs are really nice and crisp. The entire thing seems VERY well built, holds zero firing 5.56/.223. I LOVE that it's short and the quick release mounts are super nice. It seems to hold zero when removing it from the rifle and putting it back on. The turret locks/adjustments are REALLY nice and easy to use. Looks REALLY cool too. I do wish it had a place to mount and handle to manipulate the magnification adjustment - it's a bit stiff.\n\nGet this scope, TOTALLY worth the money.;Great scope.
73;34.0;3.0;16.0;"Update 5.  I've now talked to customer service at Leapers who make this scope.  I think it would be fair to say that the issue I describe below is about what they consider acceptable.  It remains a good choice where compactness is important for hunting and plinking where extreme precision isn't necessary -- beer cans at 25Y, deer at up to 100Y or so, etc.  It's not likely to satisfy you if you want deadeye accuracy (say head shots on squirrels at 75Y or more) or single hole targets beyond 25Y.\n\nThe good news is that UTG is developing a new line of products and I strongly encouraged a 'Pro' or 'Precision' version of this scope at perhaps half again the price but with the same basic features and size.  That's really the scope I want and if they do make it I'll buy the first one I see.\n\nWhat I want: Precision W/E -- no movement of reticule relative to scope body.  0.1mil clicks rather than 1/4MOA. Thread both end bells to allow use of screw-on accessories.  Nice to have would be a 10x or 12x fixed power version.\n\n Meanwhile I've ordered a SWFA scope that will meet my requirements although it's about 14"" long and has a 30mm tube.\n\nUpdate 4.  My latest Bugbuster -- about three months and ~500 rds. .22LR use -- has developed the dreaded loose reticule.  It'll jump about 1/2"" to 1"" at 50Y when you dry fire from a rock solid rest -- sandbag under toe of stock and a bipod on the fore end.  When shooting the jump itself isn't a problem because the bullet is already on its way and the rifle doesn't move but the reticule doesn't necessarily return to precisely the same position it was in for the next shot: THAT is a problem.  Groups may be up to 3/4"" or so larger than expected, often either vertical or horizontal lines.  Sometimes they'll be two 1/8"" groups spaced by 3/4"".\n\nI have written Leapers (UTG) about the issue; if anything comes of it I'll post accordingly.\n\nI'll get a $250 or higher price scope and save the UTG for 'whatever.'  It's still good for a hunter for whom 1-2 MOA is good enough, but not for more accurate shooting.  Downgraded from five stars to three.\n\nUpdate 3: A few weeks after Update 2.  Suppose you had the Bugbuster on a small .22 and you dropped it, muzzle hit your toe, then the rifle went over onto the concrete, landing on the scope.  After a few ... words ... and checking for looseness (which I don't believe you'd find) you'd sight it in again and perhaps find the rifle shooting 36 clicks high and 24 clicks right but without other noticeable damage.  Not that I know anyone stupid enough to do that, but, hypothetically.\n\nSeveral hundred rounds of .22LR match ammo under it since the last review: No trace of the dreaded crosshair twitch described below.  I still want this in Mil/Mil.  No, I DON'T want first focal plane: That's good for certain professional shooters but they aren't buying scopes in this price class and for 99% of US, FFP's disadvantages outweigh the advantages.  Just give us 0.1 mill (rather than 1/4 MOA) clicks and otherwise upgrade the thing as described below.  Send me an email when you do it and I'll buy one that day.\n\nThis is the close to perfect scope for a 10/22 or Mini-14, probably also for many AR setups.  You can buy better optics (start at 3x the price ...) but nothing so compact with this combination of features.\n\nUpdate 2: Two years or more on from the original review, I bought another.  Larger scopes make a rugged carbine-size rifle both fragile and unhandy; the only others this size are 4x or less and never AO so if you sometimes practice at very short ranges you have to fight parallax.\n\nIf you drop a carbine with a 14"" scope and the rings 4"" apart in the bed of your pickup you will be using iron sights for the rest of that trip.  The Bugbuster is a near-ideal combination of features.\n\nOne more problem I've discovered in many hours of use:  Some of these scopes -- I have three or four now -- develop a slightly loose reticule over time.  This is most easily seen by dry firing from a solid rest while watching the crosshairs on a target: If they twitch more than the rifle itself (to which the scope is firmly attached) you have the problem and a new scope will give you tighter groups.  Maybe this adds 1/4"" to 1/2"" to group size at 50 Yards?  Unlikely to bother a hunter but not great for precision paper-punching.  You never see this in a scope at $200-up but none of those scopes are so compact.\n\nI used these scopes on some pretty high-recoil rifles before discovering this issue: I'm not sure if that caused the problem or not.  Also I don't recall the first ones I bought being described as 'true strength' so there may have been improvements.  The new one (""TS"" and ""SSS"") had no twitch whatsoever from the box and will live on a .22; I'll update this in a few months with results.\n\nThe range calibrations on the new one seem spot on: Set it for 50Y and you have NO parallax.  Field flatness -- is everything you can see at once at the set range in perfect focus? -- isn't equal to the $200-up scopes, at least not when set near maximum magnification and focused closer than infinity but this is a minor issue: You need perfect focus near the crosshairs a lot more than near the edges.\n\nI'd like to see a 'pro' model of this: Keep the size and features, fix the squishy clicks, fix the twitchy reticule problem (if not already done), improve the field flatness (if the optical geometry allows -- I don't know about that), and GIVE US 1/10 MIL CLICKS instead of 1/4 MOA.  Yep -- Mil/Mil.  It's just a lot easier to do the math with 10 clicks per dot than with 14 and I haven't seen another 1"" Mil/Mil scope at less than several hundred dollars.  Thread both ends to allow using quality caps and other accessories bought separately and DITCH THE CHEAP FLIP-UPS.  DO NOT go to side focus -- adds cost and complexity for negligible value.  Easily worth another $50 to me.\n\nA bit more eye relief would be good:  It's marginal at the .30-06 recoil level if you are wearing glasses as most shooters do, and many shooters would want to use an offset mount on a 10/22 or similar size rifle with the common 13-1/2"" length of pull.\n\nUpdate 1:  Three trips to the range since the below and I can add a bit.\n\nFirst, the first click or two on either knob now seems a bit squishy.  It works okay but not up to the rest.  A minor point though.\n\nThe focus distance calibration is a bit off: You need to set about 2 mm along the objective ring farther than the actual distance in order to get rid of all parallax.  (At 50 yards you need to set near the 100 yard mark on the objective.)  This is easily fixable by making another dot on the scope body.  On a higher price scope you could adjust this but looks to me like the ring is glued rather than fastened to the objective with a setscrew. At this price I'm okay with this.\n\nI've tried the illuminated reticule again:  In addition to the uneven rheostat it tends to light up the rest of the inside of the scope.\n\nThe caps rot as scope caps for the reasons already noted.  The good news is they make pretty good targets at 50 yards. Though they are so stiff that even hitting one in the center doesn't flip it open ... maybe a shotgun?  But I don't own a shotgun.  The better news is that PVC pipe caps for 1"" and 1-1/4"" pipe with a couple of pieces of round elastic make an excellent and (with a bit of paint) professional-looking bikini that can be used with/without the sunshade in place.\n\nThe thing works close to perfectly.  Shoot a group, turn the knobs and you're on. The mil dots are 14 clicks apart so it's not too hard to figure the correction. Certainly a great value at this price, AND an ideal scope for a smaller rifle where the mounts are too close together for a solid mount of a 12"" or 14"" scope. I'm going to buy another -- or maybe two.\n\nOriginal review:  I bought the bug buster for a poor man's precision .22 rifle project.  It appears to be every good thing that other reviewers have said about it:  rock solid construction,  smooth positive clicks and locking, my first impression is excellent optics.  At 9x and infinity the craters on the moon are absolutely sharp from edge to edge of the scope field with just a bit of a color fringe at the edge of the moon -- perfectly tolerable in a riflescope.  (I suppose a $2000 scope is color corrected but if that's what you want you are not reading this review.)  Maybe just a wee bit out when focused at 3 yards at center field and you move to the edge; I'm not sure.\n\nThe rheostat for the reticule illumination varies the brightness a bit unevenly; a trivial issue.\n\nYou have to see it to appreciate the quality of the building details.  For example, all the markings are engraved: No photoprint, no tape wrapped around knobs.  There's NOTHING that says ""They tried to save a bit of money on that""; more like ""What's the very best way to do that?""  The one exception is those chintzy polyethylene flip caps: I've seen better caps on milk bottles.  As others have said, you can't flip them open without flipping at least one off.  That's bad enough, but they're hard to open, too: I don't like to put that much force on a scope and there's no convenience factor in a cap that you can't easily open with one finger, anyhow.  The cheapest bikinis would be a better option, and keep an extra $0.50 in profit.\n\nBut that's a trivial point: Tomorrow at the range I will see how far away from the trashcan I can stand and still pitch those caps in.  That info, more on the optics and the rest of the range report will follow.";Ooops -- A serious problem
6;35.0;5.0;6.0;Wow! This scope is VERY nice! It looks great on my carbine & the image is a lot easier to acquire than I was expecting. I was pretty worried that I would be spending too much time trying to find the target while in a hurry due to what I imagined was going to be a too small of a area or viewing portal to see through while trying to quickly acquire the target But, that concern is so totally gone. The viewing portal is a good bit larger than I was anticipating. And, that means that the target is very quickly acquired because the sight picture regarding this scope pretty much just dominates & forces a good clear image onto the eye. The crosshairs are not too thick & do not hide any target that is out to 100 meters. Buying this scope verifies that I'm no idiot. Everything about this scope is excellent quality. I'd buy this scope again w/o hesitation. I looked @ hundreds of scopes in this price range before selecting this one. It is everything I was looking for in a rifle scope.;Everything I was looking for in a rifle scope.
33;36.0;4.0;10.0;"Just bought a 10/22 take down model,  and need something to sharpen my vision at distance - so after weeks of tirelessly reading reviews and speaking with others,  I decided to ""settle"" on this.  Now - I say this because I'm a value driven consumer,  meaning I rarely buy the most or least expensive item,  but rather the one that is quality for the situation and will offer the best bang for buck.  That includes time - after all,  that is my most valued currency,  so swapping out defective junk wastes my time,  so while warranties are great they don't sell me by any means.  So I could've bought a more expensive scope,  and been happy if it were what I wanted. But turns out the one I wanted happened to be very inexpensive.\n\nSo - my rifle came with a weaver mount.  After hours of trying to mount it and level it,  I determined it WILL NOT FIT PROPERLY ON STOCK ISSUE WEAVER RAIL FOR 10/22.  The clamps on the rings don't fit right,  the slots don't lime up right. .. frustrating because this was my weekend to go sight this baby in.  So,  I researched again for a pictinny rail,  since after detailed measurements I found this scope and ring set up will work perfectly with one.  I bought the UTG tactical low profile rail mount for 9-freaking-dollars (great price) and that fixed the problem straight up.  Didn't need a vice,  mounted and leveled this thing in 15 minutes on the picatinny rail.\n\nNow - sight this in,  3 shots and zeroed at 50 yards.  Dismount,  remount,  still zeroed.\n\nCan't speak for longevity yet though.\n\nPro's : compact,  great infinity type settings to fine tune your eye balls,  looks nice and quality,  extra options I really didn't need but are nice to have.\n\nCon's  - states picatinny or weaver but did NOT work with stock weaver rail,  and MADE IN CHINA!  Oh,  and a little heavier than what I wanted.\n\nFinal word -  MANUFACTURE IN AMERICA!  It takes so much time and energy to find made in America and that should be the rule,  not the exception!";Almost perfect for my 10/22 take down
59;37.0;5.0;14.0;"I bought a Leapers 3x9x40 scope for my issued M16A2 in 2006 before going to Afghanistan. the scope was great but after 6 years of use and storage I noticed the lens came loose inside the tube. I bought it through an outside vendor and did NOT have a receipt. I did however have all the original packaging for the scope. i called Leapers (took a while to get through) and explained everything. They had me fill out a online warranty request and in 2 days i got an email with a service order number. I put the email in the box, sent it off, and a week later got another email saying it was covered under the LIFETIME warranty. My scope is no longer made but I received FULL MSRP towards a new Leapers product of my choice. Thanks to Paul in warranty returns. How can you beat that?\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nI chose the 3X9X32 Bug buster to replace my old scope. Leapers (UTG) applied the MSRP of my old scope, added the military/law enforcement discount, and shipped the scope out that same day by UPS. I received it, mounted it on my Ruger 10/22 Take-Down and I'm busting bulls-eyes like crazy. It's powerful yet compact enough to stay mounted and sill fit in the bag. Great optics, the red/green illuminated Mildot reticule works perfect in the dawn/dusk hours. After the turrets are set the locks keep them firmly in place. The ""quick release"" scope rings are a breeze to attach. All this (including shipping) for $20 over the credit applied from an outstanding warranty policy. GREAT COMPANY!";review update
21;38.0;2.0;7.0;"I've had this scope for about a year and I'm not impressed. I knew I was buying a cheap scope when I purchased it, so my expectations weren't very high. The reviews looked pretty good so I gave it a ""shot"" anyway. This might be overly critical for a cheap $90 scope, but I have several complaints. First of all, I put the scope on my Core15 M4 that is 5.56, and Initial impressions were pretty good. The scope felt solid, everything worked as it should, it came with everything needed to mount it to my AR. The illuminated recticle was bright, clear, and looked good.\n\nMy complaints:\n- Supplied mount is too low. Target acquisition is difficult, and a one inch riser should really be used if mounting to a flat top AR.\n- Flip caps are crooked and loose. It's a pretty minor thing, but I felt it was worth mentioning.\n- Eye relief isn't very good, which also makes target acquisition difficult. Especially for someone who hasn't practiced with this particular scope. Expect to spend sometime practicing and getting a consistent cheek weld. Otherwise you'll spend a lot of time battling eye relief.\n- On low power settings (maybe from 3x to 5x) there is a noticeable fish eye effect.\n- Like several others have said, it appears that the recticle is actually a little bit crooked. You can level it out but then the knobs are all look crooked. Mine case is minor, but it looks like other reviewers have had more serious cases of this.\n- My biggest complaint is that the recticle moves all the time! I swear, every time I shoot the gun I have to re-zero the scope. It's very frustrating and makes me not trust the gun as much as I should. I could probably live with all the other complaints, but I refuse to own a scope that makes my firearm less consistent. If I need to take out a target at 100+ yards, I wouldn't trust this scope to do that unless I just got done zeroing it.\n\nThe verdict: This scope would be GREAT for an airsoft gun. It feels solid, looks cool, and the recticles light up bright and clearly. In fact, I will probably give this scope to my little brother to put on one of his airsoft guns. Ultimately you need to do yourself a favor and spend a little more money to get a Nikon P223BDC or a Vortex Strikefire. For $160 you can get a pretty decent scope (and that's still very cheap). Don't expect to get anything worthwhile for $90. I will be replacing this scope soon.";What you should expect for $90

16;40.0;5.0;6.0;If you're wanting a great little scope for your AR and don't want to drop a lot on it then I would, and will, recommend this to anyone. I got it zeroed at 100 yards in 4 shots using Remington FMJBT 55 grain and was driving the tacs through the same hole over and over. Moved to 200 yards and it's still dead on. The illumination is great and I usually stick to a lower light power. Great for shooting at dawn and dusk. The sun shade provides great relief as well.

After that 1"" groupings.  Went out to 50 yards same thing 1"" -1.5"" groupings all day long.  I even removed the scope with the quick release and reattached.  No adjustments same result 1-1.5"" groupings.  Any miss was not a result of the scope it was me.  I am very pleased with the purchase and would recommend highly for the average shooter.

Not sure id deploy with it but for hunting and plinking it's great.  The illuminated reticle is a nice feature,  especially when using with a flashlight attachment at night.

Took it to the range yesterday zeroed it in with my boresight, and it pretty much held after 100+ rounds, maybe one or 2 clicks at the very end to re-adjust.  The wind and vertical adjustment are very solid and tight, the clicks are sharp and hold true.  I got this for my AK.

Finally realized that the reticle inside the scope was vibrating around ultimately to the point where horizontal was off on the scope.

I am going to return it to amazon and see if there's a problem returning a defective item. I will update this review if there is a problem. I see a lot of positive reviews on this scope and that's great, but I also see that the people that notice the problem also notice it on all the replacement scopes they get. That's not a coincidence.

14;48.0;5.0;5.0;I bought this scope to mount on a Century C308 7.62x51mm rifle.  Another reviewer stated that this scope & furnished rings fit his C308 out of the box.  It does, but....\nMy own experience is that, yes, it does fit and allows plenty of room for the C308 cocking handle.  However, for my eyes, the scope must be positioned as far back as possible on the Picatinny rail to achieve correct eye relief.  To do that requires removing the rear dust cover on the scope.  The included UTG scope rings are their 'medium' height rings, measuring 15mm from the rail to the saddle.  The UTG 'high' rings are 5mm higher (20mm).  I'll be ordering a set of those tomorrow, which should allow me to use the rear dust cover.  The weather has not cooperated to allow me to take the gun out and sight-in the scope, but I expect it to perform very well.  When setting it up, I found no indication of a tilted reticle, as a couple of reviewers mentioned.  Hint:  Put your gun in a padded vise, lay a bubble level across the Picatinny rail and adjust until level.  Mount the rings, position the scope, then lay the level across the windage knob.  Adjust until level, then carefully tighten down the rings.;I bought this scope to mount on a Century C308 ...

29;52.0;1.0;6.0;I am at a loss as to why there are any positive reviews on this scope other than it does have a lot of eye candy when you first look at it.\nNow I'll share with you what I received after purchasing this scope. First, it has a wire cross hair which, in and of itself isn't a bad thing if it's made correctly. Mine has the top of the vertical hair welded to the right side of the support post and the bottom of the hair is welded to the left side of the post. This makes the vertical hair cant sideways. The center of a cross hair should be comprised of 4 right angles of 90 degrees for each quadrant. Mine is 98 degrees on the top L. and 83 degrees on the top R.. On the bottom L. it is 102 degrees and the R. is 78 degrees which tells me the horizontal hair is also canted. What this does is make it impossible to adjust the elevation without changing the horizontal sight picture. This make sighting the scope in to the center-point almost impossible and the hash marks worthless.\nThe focus for the cross hair doesn't have a locking mechanism so it turns every time you shoot. Why they put an A.O. on this scope is beyond me. A scope is usually paralex free up to 9 power. If you adjust the A.O. for a clear picture at your target and your target moves less than one foot, it is out of focus.needing adjustment.\nIf you use the sunshade, the flip-up cover won't fit. If you wear any type of hat with a bill (such as a baseball style one) the flip-up on the front won't allow you to see through the scope.\nOver the decade of my shooting and hunting life I have purchased over 50 scopes. This scope is probably the worst one I've ever owned and I'm going to try to see if I can get my money back.\nPlease believe me and don't purchase this scope. It will disappoint you immensely.;Don't believe Positive Reviews!

At this price, it's more like you're buying the quick release rings, caps and sun shade and getting a variable power scope with illuminated reticle free. Bought it for a 10/22 takedown simply because of its size -- I read many reviews that said the 10/22 will fit in the stock bag with the scope attached. I believe that it will, but I haven't tried it yet. I zeroed it at 100 yds on a 300 BLK AR to test, and that is where it has stayed. For under $100 (actually about $80) I'll buy another for the 10/22.\n\nIs it crystal clear from edge to edge? No. If you focus it in the middle it's clear about 3/4 of the way across.

Will it break if I drop it? It hasn't yet. If it does, I'll buy another. Will it hold zero for 1,000 rounds, and will the adjustments still be accurate? Who knows? All good after a couple hundred rounds of 300 BLK. I'll update this review if that changes, but you won't hear me complain.

25;58.0;5.0;5.0;I read about tilted reticle thing and my opinion is that most likely the scopes were not installed and leveled correctly.  I had no problems with this. Scope looks well made. Everything seems to be of good quality on this scope for the money . I paid 67$ with free shipping.  I am going to use it on my ar15. I got it for the purpose of shooting out to 50-200 yards. The QD scope rings are nice as well I may use a riser so I can still keep my BUIS mounted. I will update this review after I get rounds down range.;Very nice!

Perfect for short range stuff and maybe an occasional ""beyond"" 100 yarder but perfect for the caliber I've chosen. I was so impressed with it that I bought the UTG/Accushot 4x16x56 for my new Ruger Hawkeye M77 All Weather in .223 and the glass is flawless and wow is it bright! You can't go wrong with this item or any of Leapers products line for that matter.

60;61.0;1.0;8.0;"I had a hard time finding this scope in stock anywhere and wanted one for my Ruger 10/22.  When one finally became available on Amazon I bought it.  The box arrived factory sealed but when I took it out and looked through it one of the crosshairs was broken off.  By then there were no more available to replace it so I called the manufacturer to take advantage of their lifetime warranty. This was at the beginning of February and I was informed that they were sold out and could not replace my scope.  The gentleman stated that they had another shipment due in mid March that were all spoken for but they could ""maybe"" get me a replacement from their next order due at the end of April.  I asked if he thought it might be a good idea to keep a few on hand for warranty claims instead of selling every last one and he replied yes, but that's not how we do business.  So there you go, they have a lifetime warranty but it will take you months to receive a replacement.  I'll save up some more money and buy a name brand scope.";Damaged when received, no replacement.
67;62.0;5.0;8.0;I've bought other UTG scopes in the past for actual rifle platforms, not airsoft. I must have a stroke of luck when it comes to UTG products because I cannot brag enough about how happy I am with their products! This scope not only looks completely like it belongs on my AR but it also is performing beyond my expectations. This does nothing more for me than just garauntee that I will be purchasing more UTG products in the future. The reticle is crisp as well as the turret adustments are nice and crisp when it comes to rotating them. A++++ for this scope!;Another great leapers UTG scope!

BLACK</a>&nbsp;rail (that's Weigand not Weignad - Amazon's listing has it spelled incorrectly!) to mount on my 582-series Mini-14 tactical rifle. So far I couldn't be happier!  This scope is high quality with a clear sight picture and 3-9X magnification.  The windage, elevation, and magnification controls are pretty stiff, but I see this as a plus rather than a problem. I'd rather have them tight than worry about them loosening up while shooting.\n\nThis is the first scope I've ever owned, and it was very easy to attach the rings and then mount on the Weigand rail. I really like the quick-release rings!  Despite what some other reviewers have said, I find them to be very solid and they've held zero nicely.  This is telling as the Mini-14's piston-operated slide slams back and forth with every shot and is somewhat notorious for being a ""scope-eater.""\n\nThe red and green illuminated reticle feature is cool, but you don't have to use it. The sight picture is great with illumination off.\n\nA couple friends who own ARs went right out and purchased the Bug Buster after seeing mine. This is an unbelievable scope for $80 bucks!";Perfect tactical scope for Mini-14
71;64.0;4.0;8.0;"I really like this scope, looks great and functions well. However, I will say that it was very frustrating to sight in. To sight it in, you need to losen the locking screw that holds the adjustment knobs in place so they don't get moved inadvertently. Well, if you losen it too much, the knobs simply turn and do not make any changes. If its too tight, the knobs do not turn at all. You have to find the sweet spot to get it to click (each click is like 1/4"" at 100 yards). Once I found this, it wasn't that hard to sight in, just took lots of adjusting to the locking screw. This probably wouldn't have bothered me as much if I wasn't stuck in an indoor range with no AC sweating like a pig (I know, sighting in a scope at a small 25 yard range is stupid, but I currently don't have access to anything else at the moment).\n\nI really like the quick detach, as I can swap it out for my red dot easily (which I wish also had the quick detach).\n\nAlso, the dust cover on the front of the scope is very hard to open which is a bit annoying. Maybe it has a breaking-in period.\n\nOverall very happy with the purchase. I wanted a compact 3-9x to fit my Ruger 10-22 Takedown so that it would not extend to far over the end of the reciever.";Nice, but hard to make adjustments
50;65.0;5.0;7.0;Apparently the crosshair alignment worker sobered up because the crosshairs line up with the caps when viewed through normally.\n\nHowever the caps themselves are not sitting parallel to my AR-15 flattop upper when viewed from the front, because I tend to cant the rifle when aiming, so the crosshairs do appear to be level to me when sighting through the scope at a target...(if that makes any sense to you)\n\nAnyway, the bottom line is between all the included accessories and the overall quality, I'm very satisfied with the $$$ spent on this one and that's what really counts.;Just What I Was Looking For!
35;66.0;1.0;5.0;I read reviews going back to 2012 and one of the common problems is horizontal alignment being off. I took a chance that UTG would correct this quality issue but apparently they don't consider it worth addressing. The horizontal is off about 5 degrees which will keep this from going on anything but a pellet rifle. Will not consider UTG again.;low cost but still needs work
62;67.0;5.0;7.0;"Picked this scope up for my Ruger 10/22 with Archangel Nomad stock kit. Was looking over the description at the time, and seemed like it was offering a lot of features for a very reasonable price. In fact for all the features it had to offer, I was certain that there was going to be a ""gotcha"" in there somewhere, like cheap optics and/or cheap build. However, I figured for a .22 LR rifle that was essentially going to be a plinker and range toy, it really didn't need expensive top-end optics to begin with.\n\nWhat a pleasant surprise this scope has been! Thus far it more than met my expectations by far. Yes, it features all the bells and whistles as per the description... illuminated crosshairs that can be switched to either red or green with varying intensity, parallax adjustment, tactical style knobs for windage compensation, pop-up lens-caps and sunshade, and quick disconnect clamps for mounting on a picatinny rail. However, the build quality of the scope itself is surprisingly good, especially considering the very reasonable price-tag for what you get. The heart and soul of any scope is of course the optics and this one does not disappoint. I found the optics to be very clear and bright with no appreciable distortion, nice field of view, and very good eye relief. Knobs and rings move freely without excessive tightness like I have experienced with a couple of previous scopes, with overall a good feel to them. Finally, the quick disconnect clamps really do seem to hold the scope on securely, and yet makes it easy to remove the scope should I wish to go to iron sights or swap to another rifle.\n\nField performance has had no complaints. So far have fired about 100 rounds and scope has held zero just fine. No issues with durability, although it's not as if firing a .22 at the range is going to be very hard on equipment. LOL!\n\nVerdict:\n\nHave to give this product 5/5... I'm honestly not finding any real fault with this scope! Unless something strange happens down the road to change my mind, I feel that this scope really offers a lot of value for the money and would have no problem recommending it.\n\n****UPDATE****\n\nWell, looks like this scope has had it's trial by fire. Accidentally fumbled the scope as I was trying to mount it on my rifle, and I dropped it... not only that, but it bounced off of a sharp rock putting a nice little nick in one of the scope rings. Guess what? Not only was the scope itself undamaged, but IT HELD IT'S ZERO! I've put about 500 rounds through the rifle with the scope mounted since that incident with no issues whatsoever. I think I can safely report that this scope on top of all the other features is durable.\n\nThat being the case, I would actually upgrade my review and say this is a phenomenal scope for the money.";A lot of scope for the money
38;68.0;1.0;5.0;"I received this scope yesterday, It was Immediately mounted onto my Benjamin Titan NP .22 Cal Air Rifle, I had my doubts because I have killed 3 scopes with this gun, First scope being the factory scope, and the next 2 being Centerpoint 4x16-40 scopes.\n\nI am so Glad I bought this scope, I immediately Zeroed the scope and put it through my own little performance test. I fired around 200 Pellets back to back and the scope never lost Zero, while my other scopes only lasted 15-25 shots before needing a re-zero.\n\nThe Internals were straight as with others they were tilted slightly, I highly recommend this scope with what I have seen so far.\n\nIn the long term I don't know how this scope will perform, but I think this one will last a good while.\n\nI will update in the future if I run into any issues\n\nUpdate 03/24/2015\n\nScope still holding Zero after about 1000 shots.\n\nUpdate 04/04/2015\n\nScope is still holding True, A buddy of mine bought a Leapers 4x32  (on amazon for $39), and his is holding true also. Great scopes for the money and can definitely hold up to magnum air rifles (He has the same gun but in .177 cal).\n\nUPDATE 4/15/2015\n\nChanged my Review to a 3 Star, The scope finally gave way and started to drift off Zero. I re-zeroed twice in 2 days and on the 3rd day it was still off. It drifted 1/4 Inches at 15 Yards after about 50 shots (which would be massive at 40-50 yards). I made sure it WAS the scope and not the Air Rifle, I cleaned the barrel and Tightened stock screws along with the barrel pivot screws and Scope mount screws (All of which were very tight).\n\nI still believe these scopes are great scopes for what you pay, I opted to receive a replacement  and give it another shot since I really do like these scopes, luckily I still had 2 days to Return. I will be updating when my replacement comes in.\n\nUpdate 05/05/2014\n\nWhat garbage, when I received my replacement I noticed it was an old gen. I said to myself ""well ill just give it a try"". About 2 days after I got this scope I didn't use it since  had ordered a Benjamin Discovery and I put it on my discovery. I went to a buddies house this past weekend and man we could not get that discovery to shoot a decent group to save our lives.....I went and cleaned the rifle and I even went as far as washing the pellets and lubing with paraffin wax.......nothing\n\nWait here is the good part, I had an old Barska 22 Plinkster scope on my .22LR and I thought I'm just going to put this scope on it ""just to see""......and WALA!!!

52;69.0;1.0;6.0;1st scope the Ocular end moved, the end just popped up about 1/8th of an inch and it was froze there you could not move it. Called Amazon and as usual they acted like like Amazon and shipped me a new one.\n\nRecieved new one on 8/8/13 and on 8/17/13 I was out trying to sight new scope in, I thought maybe it was me having problems. I looked down and the same thing had happened Ocular end had popped up. Only difference was this one you could move up and down.\n\nThe other problem is that when trying to use the zoom function you almost needed a pliers to operate it.

53;70.0;4.0;6.0;"As the title says, ""A good scope at an excellent price"".  Is this an ACOG or Nightforce?  Nope.  But for most uses, this is adequate. I have it mounted on a Sig 556R in 7.62x39, and the 3x9 power fits perfectly with the ballistics of this round. No problem achieving tight groups at both 50 and 100 yards.  The turrets click and lock well and once set, it has not lost zero with over 400 rounds fired. I also like the fact that the magnification adjustment is fairly tight: does not change magnification under recoil.  The mounts that come with this are much better than I expected: lock down tight and have not come loose.\n\nNow the downsides:  At low light levels, you can tell that this is not a top end scope.  Does not pick up light at dusk as well as my high end Leopold does.  Also, the two color illuminated reticle is more of a ""tacti-cool"" item than something that is needed....but it is cool looking.\n\nOverall, this scope is hard to beat at the price Amazon has it for.  My original thought was to stick this on the 556R while I looked at the different ACOG's, Nightforces, and LEopolds....  After having it on there for a while, I think it will stay.  How long will it last?  Who knows, but it seems well made {if a little heavy} and the 7.62x39 is not a heavy recoiling round, so only time will tell.";Good Scope at an excellent price
41;71.0;1.0;5.0;Although not as expensive as some of the higher end Nikon scopes, I still felt I would receive a high quality scope. That unfortunately wasn't the case.\nThe scope itself looks great and sits on the rifle (M&P15Sport) without any issues. The scope gathers light without issue so the front sight is invisible when looking through the viewport. The Red/Green illumination system is where I had all of my issues. When the illumination actually occurred, it would flicker on and off with just the movement of the rifle. I wasn't even able to sight it in using my bore sight because the illumination kept failing. When the sight wasn't flickering, it would cease to function entirely. I'm highly dissappointed with this purchase and will most definitely be returning it.;"""Made in China"""
42;72.0;1.0;5.0;Red and green crosshairs were very dim and could not be seen in normal daylight.  Tried multiple batteries but nothing changed.

Buyer beware.;Can't handle recoil, don't waste your ammo.
72;74.0;1.0;6.0;I got this scope based on all the great reviews.  On initial inspection, the scope seems very solid.  The mount is low and I had to purchase a high rise to make it fit on my ar15.  I wish the eye relief is a bit longer.  The optics are otherwise reasonably good.  However, I have zero windage adjustments.  None.  Elevation works find.  Had to return to amazon.;Perhaps I got a bad sample?
45;75.0;5.0;5.0;I already have one UTG scope on my AR-15 that I can just about drive nails with at 100 yards.  I bought this for my 10/22 breakdown because it is small can be easily detached to put in the carry bag for the 10/22.  I am 50 so the AO has become a necessity for me and love this one.  I buy Vortex for my favorite guns but for the price, UTG makes a great scope.  In my opinion UTG beats NCStar (obviously), AIM and all the other Chinese made scopes hands down.;Wow
47;76.0;5.0;5.0;I searched for quite a while for a compact scope for my AR. I read several reviews on alot of different scope. When I saw this scope I was impressed with all the positive reviews. The price was in my budget so I ordered it.\nRight out of the package I was impressed with the look and feel of the UTG. Once at the range it was very easy to sight in. The images through the scope are very clear as well as the rectile. The illumination for the rectile is nice but I really haven't used it yet. The turets for windage and elevation adjustments are easy to lock and unlock. the also have a very audible click when making adjustments which is very helpful.\nThe only thing I recommend is using a riser under the scope. My AR is a flat top and I used a 3/4 inch riser which put the scope at just the right level. Once I put this on it only took two rounds of three shots to sight it back in.\nSo far it has held zero very well. For the money I spent I am VERY pleased with the scope.;Great Scope For The Price!
78;77.0;5.0;6.0;"Hi all,\nI bought this scope to mount on a DPMS AR 5.56.  The rifle was purchased for my wife as a valentines present.  (nothings says I love you like a high power weapon, LOL) Well I have taken it to the range a couple time before and sighted it in.  I would say the rifle has had a good 600 rounds through it before she was able to shoot it on her own.  Now before I describe anything else let me tell you that my wife has just started getting into guns.  She loves her little NEOS, but Really loves her Sig 226 .40 cal.  The AR was a first for her. She had shot a rifle a couple of times before but it had always been open sights.\nSo we hit the range on Sunday afternoon and I ran a few rounds through it to make sure it was still sighted in (no adjustments needed).  For me it looked good.  Then I set her up and she starts plinking away at the target 46 yards away (farthest it could go).  I bring it home and my mouth dropped.  Guys do you know it feels to know your wife is a better shot than you...?  Pretty damn good in my book!  I will upload the picture of the target.  She ran 16 rounds through it and not only did all of them get on the 8.5 x 11"" target, but 15 of them were within 1"" of center.  As far as the other little guy...  ""don't worry about that little guy.""  We proceeded to run a hundred rounds through for the day and it has stayed zero since I first sighted it in.  And yes her groups were tighter than mine...

I had an easy return to Amazon and was quickly credited back for the order. I then re-ordered another one.\n\nOne thing I didn't like is the ""medium' scope rings. They are just high enough to keep it just off of my M4. I will need to order new rings to make it high enough to make the front sight lower in the view.";Not a bad scope for the price
51;79.0;1.0;5.0;BUYER BEWARE...The UTG 3x9 compact CQB Bug Buster is the biggest piece of junk I have ever bought off of Amazon. The reticles are misaligned and off set and the view is blurry and there is nothing you can do to focus it. I would have sent the scope back to Amazon for a refund but when I installed the scope on my rifle I scratched  the tube while adjusting the rings and I am sure they would not accept me returning it damaged. So now I have a $75.00 paper weight. If you decide to buy this scope you have been warned that it is junk..;BUYER BEWARE,,
54;80.0;1.0;5.0;Based on the price and my buddies recommendation, I bought this scope for my 12 year old daughter.  At first glance, it appeared to be a decent quality scope with clear optics.  After mounting it, I squared the windage and elevation adjustments to the rifle, only to find that the reticle was more than 5 degrees off (counter-clockwise).  I was so upset that I immediately removed it, boxed it back up and returned it.  I will not be buying any Leaper's or UTG products in the future.;Extremely Unhappy

70;83.0;5.0;5.0;I put this scope on my Crosman M4-177.  I wanted something for very close range pest control (~5-10 yards), and this scope and gun combo fit the bill perfectly.  Yes, I realize the scope costs more than the gun, but I'm sure the scope with end up on another gun later down the road.\n-The illuminated reticle is nice, and the adjustment knob works like it should. Red and Green brightness are both easy to adjust.\n-The scope came with mounting rings in the box, and they have the quick release tabs. These rings might be a little too low for this gun.  I find it a little difficult to get my eye down low enough on the stock of the gun but it's not a big problem.  I might get some taller rings someday..\n-The elevation and windage knobs are super easy to adjust.  No tools required, and the locking mechanism seems like it holds just fine.\n-I really like the flip-up lens caps that are included with this scope. They give a cool tactical look to the gun and are very quick and easy to open and they don't get misplaced.\nOverall,  this scope is a fantastic value.  I would expect it to perform very well on any short range rifle.  Ie. airguns or .22 rifles.;Popular Scope For A Reason!
80;84.0;4.0;5.0;"The quality of the scope is pretty decent.  I didn't realize how low the rise is, so I'll likely have to invest in a one inch rise for the picatinny rail.  The flip up caps are a little loose, so when you try to flip them, they move a little.  Not a big deal; they still cover both lenses well.  You definitely need to read the directions to install the scope correctly.  Even after reading it, I found that the elevation adjustment took some serious pressure (downward) to engage the actual adjustment mechanism.  At first, I was turning the adjustment knob freely without hearing any tell-tale ""clicks.""  With a little jiggering, I was finally able to engage the knob appropriately and I heard the clicks.  Sadly, I ran out of time on the range to zero the scope in.  Once I get the chance, I will re-engage and update the review here.  So far, the product looks decent.";Should work. . .
82;85.0;3.0;5.0;"First impressions where really good.  Until I unlocked the ""Zero Unlocking RING"" for the windage and elevation turrets.  After (unscrewing/turning 40-70 degrees per instructions) the locking ring, I quickly found out that the windage turret didn't click at all and was actually sitting on the scope on an angle. After loosening the ""Zero Reset ALLEN"" and trying to straighten and re-tighten I got it to sit a little better but still not sitting straight.  Once I try to turn the windage past the number 2 on the scope it suddenly becomes super loose and just spins on the turrets, no clicking no resistance at all just becomes really loose.  The elevation turret seems to be just fine.\n\nOther than the turret issue it seems like a pretty good scope but not great.  Pretty solid and has some nice weight to it.  Although the rear flip open cover is pretty pointless, due to it just falling off the scope while trying to open/flip the cap with one finger.  So you must use both hands to open the cap.  Your left hand holding the ring and the other lifting the tab with your right index finger.  Or it will just slide/pop right off the scope.  If I had to do it all over again I would buy something else.  I am hoping to get it out and see if it is still operational this weekend.  But I am pretty sure I will need a 4'x 8' sheet a plywood at 25 yards to see where this thing is hitting!!!  If so it is for sure going back and I will avoid this brand of scope for good.  I normally buy Leupold and Simmons, and wanted to try something for a decent price for a .22lr gun.  But I guess the old saying is ""you get what you pay for""...  And that is true with this scope.\n\nOn another note I bought this scope for my Smith and Wesson M&P 15-22.  And I even bought higher scope rings (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AccuShot-Premium-1-Inch-Weaver-Style-See-Thru-High-Pro-Rings/dp/B001WJ6908/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AccuShot Premium 1-Inch Weaver Style See-Thru High-Pro Rings</a>&nbsp;) for this scope and it still sits too low to the rail.  With where this scope sits and the eye relief it has (not bad either) you can BARELY fit your fingers under the back end of the scope to grab the charging handle!  So I would probably get a high riser rail 1"" for this AND the highest scope mounts you can find if your plan on getting it for an AR-15 platform.\n\nSo all in all, this would be a great scope for Air Soft guns or .177 BB/pellet guns.  But for anything that actually shoots bullets, I would avoid.  Unless for some reason I got a lemon or dud, who knows.\n\nUPDATE 04-08-12!!!  So after taking this scope shooting this weekend.  I finally got it zeroed in.  It took me about 30-40 rounds, but I finally got it pretty good.  I had to turn the windage turret to the right or clockwise about 6-7 full complete turns and the elevation about 3-4 full turns up.  But after turning and turning on the turrets to get it to where it is supposed to, everything seems pretty good.";Not bad, but not great!
83;86.0;5.0;5.0;"I bought this scope for the Smith & Wesson M&P 15-22 MOE rifle with MBUS sights.  You cannot use this scope with the included rings without removing the rear iron sight because the low profile rings forces you to mount the rear QD rings about 6 rails forward of the rear sight.  This means that the eye relief starts just about where the rear iron starts, which means the relief needs to be about 6"", which this scope doesn't provide.\n\nSo, I was left to either removing the MBUS rear sight to place this scope closer to the rear, or buying higher profile rings or risers to bring the scope closer to the eye while also clearing the MBUS rear sights.  I bought two&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/UTG-Medium-Profile-Riser-Mount-with-3-slots/dp/B003TX2BD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">UTG Medium Profile Riser Mount with 3 slots</a>&nbsp;to bring the scope higher and closer to the rear.  These risers provides additional 1"" clearance, so the rear glass now sits flush over the rear iron sight.\n\nThe only other issue I have is that the lens caps have a ""large"" profile at the hinges, so it often rubs the picatinny rails while the scope body itself has 1/2"" clearance.  The addition of the risers resolved this problem, but expect to see this with no alterations.\n\nExcellent scope and strongly recommended.\n\n----- Update 4/12/2012 -----\n\nThe battery drains in less than 8 hours of constant use.

However, I would take this into consideration when purchasing my next scope.  Use of a rechargeable AA or AAA battery would be much cheaper in the long run, but will make the scope bulkier.";excellent scope with minor issues

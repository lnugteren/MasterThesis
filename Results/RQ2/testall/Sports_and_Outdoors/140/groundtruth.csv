3;1.0;5.0;4862.0;"UPDATE: If you'd like to see my review of the UP24, you can see it here. Copy & paste required if it is not clickable link:  http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZEG4YLT0HZ9Y/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm\n\nUPDATE: Several people were asking what I thought about Fitbit Flex. I got one and compared it to the Jawbone UP here:  http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CVXEEYIAIR0W/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm\n\nA couple weeks ago I received my Fitbit One Wireless Activity Plus Sleep Tracker, Black after a few months pre-order wait. I had it two full weeks, got to know and learn it, and lost it swiftly. The fact that I lost it so easily made me decide to try Jawbone Up-- thinking that if I lose my arm, I've got larger issues... My review will be a comparison of these two devices for those trying to decide between the two. Early spoiler: I recommend Jawbone Up over the Fitbit One for most people. I'll tell you why...\n\nUPDATE: There is an Android app now for the Jawbone UP. At the original time of my review it had not been released. Please check their website for which models have been fully tested/supported.\n\nHardware itself\n\nThe biggest frustration I had with the Fitbit One was that I wanted to use it for daytime activity monitoring and for sleep monitoring. Using it for both activities included moving the device from my belt clip, taking it out of the rubber clip, putting it in the wrist strap, and reversing this process each day. It felt like a chore after a few days, and some mornings I even forgot to put it back on my belt after showering & changing. These issues aren't faced with the Jawbone Up because you can leave it on your wrist at all times-- even in the shower. No annoying loss, no annoying moving it from clip to pouch to clip, no forgetting it at home in the morning. The Fitbit met it's ultimate demise after only its second fall off of my belt. It's so light and in rubber, it didn't even make a sound when it left me and met the ground. It was never found. Long live my FitBit One on however many belts it ends up on before it's lost again terminally...\n\nBattery Life & Charging\n\nBattery life on the Fitbit One can be as much as 14 days. The Jawbone Up is rated for 10. Both devices include a USB dongle for charging, and charge in about the same amount of time. Both charged fine when I used my iPhone charger to USB for their dongle.\n\nSyncing\n\nThe Fitbit One bluetooth sync's wirelessly to an iPhone if you want, or to a PC. The fitbit comes with a charging dongle, a bluetooth adapter-- which must be used as it won't work with most or all other bluetooth adapters already built in to a PC. Plan to use up one or two USB slots for the Fitbit One. It's not a constant sync-- you have to initiate the sync if you want it to sync ""now"". Update/clarification: It does sync automatically on bluetooth if you use it with your phone, but not constantly. You can force a sync any time you want.\n\nThe Jawbone Up syncs by removing the cap and plugging in to the headphone jack of the iPhone. At first this felt like it may be a step back from the Fitbit One, but ultimately it's simpler and I waste less battery having bluetooth activated on the phone all the time. It's simple, works reliably, and you can sync to multiple devices if you want.\n\nWearing\n\nThe FitBit One is quite small and the rubber belt clip is smooth and small. Many users simply drop the device in the pocket, but I'm not one to let that happen and risk loss-- ironic because I lost it via the belt clip. I also have some belts that it would't clip on, so I found myself doing creative things like clipping it inside my change pocket.\n\nThe Jawbone Up is basically a bracelet-- and a stylish looking one at that. I found that the fitment guide on the back of the box ran a little large, so I originally bought a medium. After wearing, it felt too tight. I returned it for a large. I have so far been very happy with the large size. I recommend using the print out PDF from the Jawbone site as it clearly marked me as large when the plastic guide on the box made me think medium. They recommend going ""up"" a size.\n\nFrom a daytime perspective, the wrist band of the Up hasn't bothered me at all, and actually I see it and it reminds me to move! I never saw the Fitbit One, and thus thought about it less often and had fewer reminders. More about reminders in functions/software!\n\nI do wear the Jawbone Up in the shower, and have had no issues with that so far. It feels sturdy without feeling stiff. You can manipulate it by squeezing to fit tighter, looser, reverse which side meets which, etc. It isn't a ""bendy straw"" style where it holds shape. It always holds the wrist shape. The rubber on rubber is what lets it grip more or less. It doesn't feel heavy or annoying.\n\nSoftware\n\nAside from the functionality of wrist vs belt clip, the software is really what differentiates the Jawbone Up from the Fitbit One for me. The Jawbone Up software is infinitely more useful, visually appealing and informative for me than the Fitbit One software. The Jawbone software tracks your performance over time and so does the Fitbit One-- but the Jawbone analyzes your data and makes observations-- ""Hey you had 2x your normal amount of deep sleep last night-- did you do something different?"" and other observations like that. You can also compare your sleeping data to your day's activities. The ability to view, review, and drill down/compare your data is easier/simpler/more automated and more enjoyable on the Jawbone Up than on the Fitbit One.\n\nFitbit supports some more social features-- like sharing to Facebook. Both support having friends in the system who also have the device that you can view/cheer on, etc.\n\nAs far as food logging goes, I'm not a huge user of this feature yet. What I do know is that the Jawbone Up supports scanning barcodes on food to capture what it is and content. The interface to browse and add food is far more visually appealing in the Jawbone Up than in the FitBit software.\n\nAbout sleep monitoring: I don't know if it's accuracy or philosophy, but from a span perspective both units were accurate. I actively tell them when I am about to drift off and when I'm done sleeping. From there, the data varies. The Fitbit One would say that I woke up some 20 - 40 times per night! Maybe each time I roll over it thinks that qualifies as awake, I don't know. The Jawbone Up rates that much less, but also gives me info on ""deep sleep vs light sleep and awake times"" which I find more useful than just knowing how many times I was awake. I've found this analysis interesting because some nights I'll feel like I slept all night, but don't feel rested in the morning, and the Up will conclude that I didn't have much deep sleep at that night. That allows me to look back at my day before and contemplate why: too much caffeine too late? Too little exercise? Too much food to late? etc. Helpful data to influence how you live your days.\n\nBoth of these devices sync your data to a website. I personally rarely visit either of these, and don't plan to, thus my lack of review on that regard. In the iPhone age I only go to a PC when it involves a lot of typing, for the most part.\n\nFunctions & Added Benefits -- most of my conclusions here are about the Jawbone Up.\n\nFitbit One: It has an altimeter. This is how it guesses how many flights of stairs you've climbed. It also counts dual propeller flights I found accidentally on a recent business trip. If your'e a person who is not interested in tracking sleep or want to spend the least, this device could help you start getting an idea of your day & night activities.\n\nJawbone Up:\n\n-A ""power nap"" feature that utilizes data from your normal light sleep cycle at night to determine optimum number of minutes for a power nap under 30 minutes. You can initiate a power nap by a series of button presses on the wrist band.\n\n-An inactivity reminder: The wrist band can vibrate you every so many minutes that you're inactive, and you can configure this in the iPhone app\n\n-A wake up alarm, at a custom time and you can additionally have it wake you at ""an optimum time around your alarm"" depending on your sleep cycle\n\nBoth devices allow you to customize your stride or calibrate the distance walked.\n\nI'm still only in my first week of owning the UP, and I prefer it over the Fitbit One. To me, the Jawbone Up is more of a ""holistic life data device"" due to the software and the fact that you can wear it all the time. The FitBit fits more in the fitness data device for me, because of the lack of insight the software provides on the phone and the fact that it isn't as simple and easy to wear all the time. I'm an IT guy who spends too much time in front of computers, a lot of time traveling, and generally not feeling like I am active enough. I wanted these devices to help me improve my awareness of wellness, activity and sleep results. For me, the Jawbone Up was the right answer all along.\n\nYou might know that a year ago the Jawbone Up was released and recalled within a month. There were some technical reliability issues and the company took the opportunity and almost an entire year to rework the device, refund all customers and let them keep the potentially failure-likely device. They have some impressive videos at their website about how they re-worked the device.\n\nBoth devices are good devices and neither had any critical flaws. n that, I hope this review may have helped you decide which fits your needs most. I plan to respond to any specific questions below so feel free to ask!";A comparison to Fitbit One -- The Holistic Wrist
5;2.0;4.0;1749.0;"So you buy the wristband and get the Up app on your iPhone.  When you first connect the Up wristband to your iPhone it will give you a brief rundown on how it works and setup an account for you.  After that it starts collecting your data.\n\nHere is how it works...  You wear the band 24/7.  During the day it records when you are doing nothing, doing a little, and when you are doing a lot of activity.  I tested the distance calibration with a GPS and it is actually fairly accurate; so it also records the distance you walk or run.  All this happens without any input from you.\n\nWhen you go to sleep...  You press a button (on the band) to switch to sleep mode.  When you wake up you press the button again to tell the band your day has begun.  While you slept Up recorded information about your rest.  Using Up's sensor the band knows how long you took to fall asleep, how many times you woke up, and whether you were in deep or light sleep.  It also knows how much time time you spent in these different states.  Now you connect the band to your iPhone and all your data is loaded into the app, which on my iPhone 5 runs very well.  The Up app gives you visual and numeric representations of your data.  The data is actually interesting information, especially relating to how you currently feel.  The more days you log the clearer picture you get.  This is the basic utilization of the band and app.  You have to do at least this much.\n\nAnd the Up band extras...  It can be used as an alarm clock to silently wake you up.  It can also alert you if you have done nothing (idle alarm) in a set amount of time during specific hours.  For activities that the motion sensor will not represent well (like biking) you can press the wristband's button to record an activity.  This activity can be viewed or edited separately from the other activity information.  This is helpful.  The only other thing the band does is wake you up from a mid-day nap if you need one.  This PowerNap feature takes into account your sleep history, then monitors your nap, and wakes you up at an optimal time to be refreshed in the shortest time.\n\nAnd the Up app extras...  The app is organized very well, but also fairly limited on what you can do.  You can set your current mood with emoji type smily faces.  You can connect with other Up users and if you like, share your information with them.  You can edit your activities, set goals to meet, and review your data.  Graphs and charts can be utilized to look for trends over days, weeks, or months.  You can also log what you eat using the app.  This final piece of the Up app is also the most difficult to use and understand.  While the food logging part of the app is extensive and powerful, everything else is so simple and easy to use, making it seem daunting.  You have to put some time in to figure it out.  Once you figure it out you can track your food intake and all the nutritional information that goes with it.\n\nThe wristband is very light and comfortable to wear.  Without bluetooth wireless syncing it has an incredible 10 day battery life.  Syncing via the headphone jack on the iPhone takes just seconds and only needs to be done twice a day.  Personally I prefer a few seconds syncing rather than charging the band every few days to accommodate bluetooth.  Overall the Up band/app combo is good and a decent starting point.  And the one characteristic of the Up wristband I appreciate the most... people don't think it's electronic!  Without this added attention it disappears into your everyday life, which I believe is the whole point of a device like the Jawbone Up.";Up - What it is, How it works & Why use it...
68;3.0;1.0;1483.0;What a cool premise!  Everything the Up was supposed to do appealed to me.\n\nI got my first one a bit over 2 months ago.  It was awesome.  Until it stopped working.  Well electronics aren't foolproof.  So I informed them of my experience and they said they'd send a replacement.  While I was waiting for it to arrive I mentioned that I expected the 60 day return policy would reset with my new band, but I was told it did not.  I thought that was odd.  I would expect to get two months of uninterrupted service to decide if I wanted to keep it, but that clearly is not their policy.\n\nNow as of yesterday my second band is also dead.  No lights, no vibration, no charge or sync, and resets don't work.  Frustrating!\n\nI asked for a refund and was told I'm outside my 60 days - which according to them start from the day you order the product!  Mine took well over a week to arrive, and I waited for another week for the replacement.  I have had a functioning band for less than 60 days but they refuse to bend.  I am stunned by the poor consumer experience.\n\nBottom line, the band fails way too easily and often for me, and you have no recourse if you're out of the 60 day window.  I would avoid this product, and I would avoid this company.\n\n*****  Update after 6 months ******\nI have now made my way through 4 up bands, and each one has failed on me in about the same time frame.  I think I am still under warranty, but honestly I no longer have the energy to go and get another band only to have it fail on me in another couple weeks.  I still love the idea of activity and sleep tracking, but this product clearly isn't engineered to be robust enough to provide a solution for more than a couple months at best.  Very disappointing.;Two (now FOUR!) Ups down, no refund
106;4.0;1.0;963.0;"After almost exactly two months to the day my Up died. First the charge I gave it yesterday was gone so I tried recharging it. Now it refuses to charge, and won't soft boot. I can't to a hard boot because it won't charge. It worked just great until it didn't.\n\nSupport messages to Up aren't answered because they say they have higher than normal request volume - in email. And the ""chat with support"" that they offer doesn't work at all. They'll get back to me within two days.\n\nSeems nice but once it stops working there is no recourse apparently. Avoid this product.\n\n>> Update (Feb 11, 2012):\n\nJawbone customer service did contact me the day after I wrote this review. They determined that the UP was indeed dead, and said that they would send a replacement to me. They said their fulfillment department was several days behind, but they said they would bend their policy and send me the replacement and allow me to return mine when I received it. They needed my original receipt which I provided as a PDF by email. I twice confirmed that I had a Black Onyx size Large UP, which was noted on the receipt as well.\n\nI received my replacement UP today. They sent the WRONG SIZE.\n\nI have demanded an immediate correct replacement or a refund, and explained that I was an extremely unsatisfied customer, who still can't use the UP band that was purchased a mere two months ago.\n\nSo for now I suggest that you continue to avoid this product.\n\n>> Update (Feb 12, 2012)\n\nJawbone customer support got back to me and said they would - AGAIN - send another UP.\n\nAnd as you can see below this review Jawbone has asked me to contact them at socialsupport@jawbone.com. However, in Amazon reviews and Jawbone forums the UP seems to be failing quite often. I intend to tell them that I would appreciate a refund because as far as I can see, getting a replacement UP will just push the problem two months further until I'm eventually dealing with my UP is out of warranty.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned this was a waste of $129.99.\n\n>> Update (Feb 14, 2013)\n\nJawbone Support asked me to contact them. I did so a day and a half ago, explaining my problem and asking for a refund. I have had no response of any kind.\n\nAmazon allows manufacturer comments which make it appear as though the manufacturer cares. They do not allow me to comment further on the manufacturer's comment to state what they actually did, and in this case it seems to be window dressing for appearances only.";Avoid the Jawbone Up.
23;5.0;1.0;442.0;"I am furious with this company.  I bought my band last February and by May it malfunctioned. The band stopped syncing with my phone.  I contacted Jawbone Support and they made me jump through a big fat bunch of trouble shooting crap and finally decided they would ship me a new band.  Fantastic I thought, what lovely customer service.  It was a a pain to ship the damn thing back via UPS, but whatever... I had my new band, joined back up with my ""team"" and went on my merry way crushing the competition in uninterrupted sleep per night.  (I thought I was an average sleeper, but it turns out I am world class.)\n\nWell, my daily smack talk was rudely cut short because the stupid new band stopped syncing too.  So, I go through the routine again....contact Jawbone, run the trouble shooting, it fails and I ready myself for band #3.\n\nI got an e-mail reply from some perky little sucker wishing me a ""Happy Monday"" and then telling me I didn't complain soon enough and my year warranty had expired.  So let's do a little math.... my first band worked for 3 months and my second band worked for 5 months for a grand total of 8 months of use.  I never got the opportunity to run out the 12 months of the warranty on either band.\n\nAfter rejecting my request, but before signing off, the super duper excitedly friendly Jawbone rep encourage me to rush out and buy the new UP24.  I swear to sweet Jesus this is what she wrote me, ""if you enjoyed UP the first time around, you'll love the wireless sync features this time.""  Ummmmmmm..... I just sent 8 emails saying how much I hated/despised/was infuriated by the UP band.  There wasn't one word in my complaint that indicated I ""enjoyed"" my experience with the brand or the product.  Clearly, customer service and loyalty analytics are low priorities for these guys.\n\nI feel bad though.  When I got my UP band, I was so excited I convinced about 12 friends and coworkers to buy them so they could join my team.  Ugh.  How embarrassing.  Almost every one of them has had an issue with the band and one of them has also had her band malfunction twice and is now on her third (obviously, both of hers failed within one year since they didn't hesitate to send her the third one.)\n\nBefore writing this review, I wrote Jawbone Support one more email to give them a chance to make it right.  I simply asked for a new band that would last at least 12 months (hahahahaha) or a credit towards the new UP24.  Nothing.  No response.  Crickets. So, as I promised them, I am reviewing their product and sharing my experience with everyone that is thinking about purchasing an UP band.\n\nFor the record, I didn't want to write this review and I've never taken the time to write one before.  I would rather be outside in this glorious weather taking a walk while wearing my UP band and calculating my steps, but I wanted to encourage people to stay away from this crappy thing.  You're welcome.\n\nFinal Review: Zero stars. No thumbs up. Dislike. Run far away.  Find another alternative. Keep your money.  This company does not stand by this product. I think I covered it. Now I'm going to go for a non-calculated walk and get a drink.";HATE! Product Blows! Customer Service is Worthless.
0;6.0;4.0;563.0;"This will have to be a quick review of the Jawbone UP. I've been using this for the last three weeks and found a lot to like and not to like. In the every end, I'll be trading this in for a Fitbit trial.\n\nPROS:\nLove the 1-hour idle alert if you haven't been moving. I'm a desk jockey and often forget to get up and move about. Nice feature.\n\nUP App is easy to use, graphically beautiful, nice robust food tracking (although a bit confusing at first). Would like to see it return more useful data in the future. I like the steps and sleep data. If I were more diligent I'm sure the food data would be useful too. Would like to see online tracking too. Would make for manual logging efforts much easier. More on that later.\n\nPower Nap - would love to try this feature. Haven't found time to catnap anywhere yet.\n\nSteps - nice. Didn't realize how stagnant certain days can be. Nice to know how much I've moved each day.\n\nTrends Report - I found this feature to be really useful. The screen shows two reporting factors and you can choose from a selection of factors to compare. I liked comparing my Light Sleep chart to my Deep Sleep chart. This could be really useful, but in order for you to take advantage of this you need to enter data. It's all about data folks.\n\nCONS:\nLack of Bluetooth -I initially thought perhaps manual syncing wouldn't be a problem. Unfortunately, I can tell you after weeks of using the UP wristband I wish it included BT. It's become a convenience issue; didn't mind at first until it became more and more of a nuisance.\n\nWorkout logs - Entering your workout is too cumbersome using a four-step process to enter: Activity Type, Effort Level, Start Time, and Duration. If you have a multi-faceted workout, be prepared to enter all in the app. Realistically, it's just too time-consuming for all that I do.\n\nSleep - One of the main reasons I wanted to use the UP for was sleep tracking. I have 3-month old baby and was curious to see how well I was sleeping overall. You have to press a cleverly integrated button to tell the band that you're going to sleep. Okay. If I get up for short durations, the band tells me I was ""up 3 times"". But when does the band sense you're awake fully and when you're just temporarily up? It doesn't. I've had the band tell me after a trip downstairs to prep a bottle that I only had 1.5 hours of sleep. Perhaps, but sleepy me assumed it was magically going to track my sleep again, when in fact it determined I was going to stay up. I've started to press the sleep button multiple times throughout the night after waking just to ensure I log my various sleep times after feeding, bathroom break, etc. I've forgotten on occasion to activate sleep and my graph shows a glaring gap in my log. Have to resort to several manual sleep entries in a night. Again, why am I doing this if there's I'm banded with a tracking device? Software could probably use a tweaking here and there in this area.\n\nCap - The cap can twist where it's misaligned with the rest of the band. Bad part is the leading edges can be annoying sharp. Not cut sharp by any means. More like a the edge just rubs your wrist in an annoying manner. They should incorporate a non-twistable cap. Or, BT could solve this issue.\n\nLastly, I learned I'm just not a wristband person. I'm tired of having it dangle around my wrist and found it more and more irritating. In the end when I look at the value of the data in the app and the act of wearing the band, I'm opting to return the thing because I simply don't find it useful over time. Others may find this device great for their lifestyle needs, just not me. I'd be interested to hear how others feel about the UP after some extended use because this version is still relatively new to market.\n\nOnto the Fitbit One.\nAvoiding the band-concept, I'm ready to move to the Fitbit. I already anticipate the act of tracking a little thing the size of a USB stick all day will be a chore and will have to come up with a process of keeping it with me all day and night somehow. I don't think having to put it in a neoprene wristband for sleep tracking will be fun with this thing. But, I'm hoping the data gathered will be more accurate and useful than the UP. I hope to update this review with my experience on that soon.\n\nUPDATED 12/22/12\nSo far loving the Fitbit better than than UP. Having a screen to view simple relevant data any time is really inspiring, rather having to wait to manually sync UP with iPhone to view periodic updates. More on my experience later.\n\nUPDATED 12/26/12\nSo far so good with the Fitbit! What a difference from the UP device and I mean that for the better. My concerns about the unit has been both realized and not. Keeping track of the Fitbit is a new mental task for sure. However, the routine of slipping the unit into a wristband for sleep isn't as bad as I first imagined.\n\nSimple features of the Fitbit really enhanced the user experience for me. Who would've thought that a simple display so small could be so important for this regime. I find clicking the button to see my steps taken, calories burned, steps climbed, and distance traveled very informative and useful. I don't always have to sync to my iPhone to see my data, unlike the UP. I just pick it up and cycle through the data and move on. If I need to, I'll pickup my iPhone and sync the data. Done. With the Jawbone UP I recall taking the band off and removing the cap to plug into the phone. Then sync. Then put the cap back on and place back onto wrist. Wash, lather, repeat. None of that with the Fitbit. Again, can't praise enough the simple features of the Fitbit that make such a big difference in my, and I would imagine also, any Fitbit user.\n\nSoftware is just as good. I do miss the charting features of the UP software though. Entering ""activities"" is vastly different from UP, good or bad depending on where you're coming from. Unlike the UP app where activities are broken down by specific categories, the Fitbit app is more casual in its definition. I just returned from a trip to an amusement park and was able to find an activity entry for ""casual walking less than 2 mph"" which best describes the activity. Then you enter a duration. I see this more practical. Whereas UP was more defined such as Activity > Cycle > Effort Level > Start > End. I think the Fitbit app needs an update so activities with a lengthy description can be fully understood, rather than being able to read only what fits on the iPhone screen width (need to be able to scroll to the right).\n\nIs sleep tracking better with the Fitbit? Yes and no. Sleep tracking is activated by pressing/holding the button for 2 seconds and then the screen displays a clock and timer that distinctly tells you ""I'm counting now."" When you wake, repeat the process to stop your sleep tracking. I like this much better than the UP. If you read my review above, you'll recall the UP the start by pressing a button but has no clear definition of when your sleep concludes. In my case, I had to activate UP's sleep tracking several times to ensure it tracked all my various wake/sleep cycles per night. With the Fitbit, the tracker counts and you have the ability to conclude your sleep cycle by stopping the counter. Since I wake to make my newborn periodic bottles, I now just keep my counter running until I designate to it that I'm fully awake. It offers a much easier way to track what is to me an approximation of my sleep time. I do find the ""times awaken"" deeply flawed. My unit tells me I was awakened 14x, 9x, etc. I find that excessive and inaccurate. But then again, how does the Fitbit calculate ""awaken"" activity? I don't know.\n\nGreat product. Whole-heartedly recommend to anyone interested. Purchased one for my wife for Christmas and she's loving it too, effortlessly checking the display for a quick review or syncing to her phone. I can't stress enough how Fitbit's two differentiating features of a display and wireless syncing via Bluetooth makes all the difference between these two competing products!";Not bad, but just not for me
80;7.0;1.0;326.0;I purchased UP by Jawbone on February 27, 2013.  I read the reviews about the band not working properly after a short period of time as well as the reviews raving about how great the band is at tracking activity and sleep.  I decided to purchase the band based on my very positive past experience with Jawbone's products (I own a Jambox, which I highly recommend).  On April 9, 2013 the band began to act funny, not holding a charge, and while I think about it for the past week it has not been recording sleep properly which I put it down to my own forgetfulness by not putting the band in sleep mode.  Today, April 10, 2013 the band is dead, I charged it and did a soft reboot of the band and nothing.  I should have given more weight to the reviews about the band not working properly since there were so many of them and upon reflection should have bought a Fitbit or Nike Fuel.  I would like to return the UP band and get a refund but Amazon will only accept returns within 30 days and I think I have owned the band for 40 days. It's a shame because I really liked the UP band while it worked, it is a real fitness motivator.\n\n5/9/2013\n\nUPDATE: I received a replacement band from Jawbone and it has been working fine, I have been using it for the past 14 days and I do like it, the true test will be if it works in 6 months or a year.  I will update and revise my rating if the product continues to work.\n\n6/13/2013\n\nUPDATE:  I received a replacement band on 4/27 so it is about 48 days and the band seems to be working.  I am happy about that, because as I stated earlier I do like the band, I just did not like that it died after 40 days.  I am increasing my star rating because as long as the band keeps working I think it's a good product, although I would not be comfortable recommending it to anyone until I am certain that the band will work for a longer period of time.\n\n6/15/2013\n\nUPDATE:  The replacement band stopped working.  I am finished with this product and resent that I paid to be a beta tester.  I will try to get my money back.;Save your money--buy a fitbit
119;8.0;1.0;208.0;"I was there for the V1 launch of this product in 2011. I purchased three bands--all of which failed (battery issues), two of which were replaced, both of which failed (battery issues, again). So I was out the $99 on the last band I purchased. I was really excited when Jawbone offered to give me a V2 unit at the 2012 launch. That was real nice of them I thought, seeing as I was still out that $99. My brand new UP V2 arrived and it was great! I enjoyed the new software, and the calorie tracking. I loved the addition of the nap function. I had lost four pounds and was feeling awesome.\n\nMy UP V2 was holding a charge--everything was fantastic!\n\nWell, until it wasn't.\n\nThree weeks into my UP V2 experience, and the battery stopped holding a charge. I got a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. I'd been through this before. Charge to 100%-battery dead in 2 hours-charge to 100%-battery dead in 2 hours. Oh no, it was happening AGAIN! I had been so careful. I'd made sure to take it off while bathing (Jawbone claims the V1 problem was from water seeping into the device), I'd made sure not to splash water on it while washing my hands or doing the dishes... and still, here we were with battery failure.\n\nSo I contacted customer service.\n\nAnd that's where things went into the EPIC FAIL category.\n\nI don't know what's going on with customer service. Either they feel they don't need to replace the three week old unit (which has a 60-day guarantee and a 1-year warranty) because it was received for free, or customer service is dropping the ball big time. I've submitted two tickets, and I've still yet to hear from customer service--I suppose unless you count a request for a contact number, which I gave them but then subsequently never heard back. From talking to other folks on the Jawbone UP forums, it appears that I'm not the only one having trouble with customer service, so I suspect the ""free"" part doesn't factor into it.\n\nTHE FINAL COUNT\n\nDEVICE: Great when it works, but expect it to stop functioning at some point before the 60-day guarantee.\nCUSTOMER SERVICE: Don't expect to get your money back or a new unit and you'll be fine.\n\nMY ADVICE\n\nSkip this one. Look for other offerings by Nike+ or Fitbit in the meantime.";Dismal Failure on All Counts
81;9.0;1.0;172.0;"I have never felt a need to write a negative review more than I have for this product. This has just been an awful experience for me, to the point where I will never own another Jawbone product. Even if one was given to me as a gift, I'd throw it out.\n\nI've gone through multiple Gen 2 Up bands. The reason being is after 6 weeks, they just stop working. There is no gradual decline or indication that it will die. They just die. I've gone through the RMA process, where they will make you do multiple resets of the device and then will send you a replacement after you send them back the broken band. The new one will come, work OK for awhile (notice that I didn't say ""well""), and then like clockwork, at about the 6 week mark, it just stops working.\n\nWhen the band was working, my results fluxuate between extremely precise to so inaccurate I don't know what it's doing. It wasn't uncommon for it to just disappear during workout mode. I'd have a 45 minute workout, and there would be a 15 minute window in the middle of it where it didn't record anything, even though my movements were identical before and after the blackout.\n\nIf you call Jawbone about this, they'll tell you it's you, and you should do a soft reset of the device.\n\nThe sleep mode is nowhere near accurate, especially when I compared it with a Lark. It'll have me in a deep sleep when I'm in bed, reading a book, may even get up and get a glass of water, so there is plenty of movement. It doesn't detect this, I'm in deep sleep. However, when I am asleep, I get lots of awake time and footsteps captured. I'm pretty sure I'm not sleep walking to the extent of 1500 steps.\n\nIf you call Jawbone about this, they'll tell you it's you, and you should do a soft reset of the device.\n\nThere is a calibration feature that is supposed to make the device more accurate. So I got on the treadmill and walked exactly 1/2 mile so I could use that to calibrate. The band detected that I walked much greater than that, and when I was able to ""adjust"" the distance for the walk, the lowest option they offered was 1.2 miles. Yet the number of steps it counted was pretty close to what I was counting in my head. It must think that I am 9 feet tall and my strides cover a great distance.\n\nI didn't bother calling Jawbone about this. By this point, I know they are of no help.\n\nI had a band that wouldn't even accept a soft or hard reset. I tried this on one before I called, knowing they would tell me to.\n\nIf you call Jawbone about this, they tell you that nobody else has experienced this, but they will begrudingly replace it. Yet their forums are full of people who have this exact issue.\n\nAfter my most recent band started vibrating and wouldn't stop until the battery died, I've decided I had enough. There isn't anything out there yet that tracks movements, sleep, and provides an awesome workout and food journal really well, but that doesn't mean any of us should settle for a product that is so flawed that I spend more time on the phone with customer support than I do analyzing the data it gathered.\n\nHere's to hoping that Fitbit Flex is a little better when it makes it to market.";Do Not Buy! Product is seriously flawed
9;10.0;4.0;5.0;I bought this because I was torn on a Jawbone or FitBit and wanted to see if I would even make use of it before I purchased a more expensive one. It is supposed to track steps and sleep. The steps it tracked well but the sleep doesn't track really. You have to put in the time you go to sleep and time you wake. Then it does a few hours as light sleep and then a few as deep sleep and repeats over and over. Very generic not really tracking like other models. I do like that it tracks steps though. It also tells you how many calories you burned. You can also add a food journal and the thing I really like about that is you can just scan the barcode on the food and add it that way instead of typing it all in. Another good thing- charge it for 24 hrs and you get about 9 days use out of it before needing to charge again. Bottom line, it's great at a $20 price point but it does have limits to its capabilities.\nIf you found my review helpful - please click helpful found below my review and if you have questions  [...] Thank you!!;Great Product at a $20 Price Point
107;11.0;1.0;152.0;I purchased this product directly from Jawbone approx a month and a half ago and today it completely died. Read the forums on Jawbones website before buying...alot of people have had the same issue. Looks like the second gen Jawbone is failing like the first gen. I will say that the product and app were great while it was working. Too bad it didn't last.;Jawbone Up 2nd Gen Failure
125;12.0;1.0;151.0;"Final update (read below to get full context):\n\nThree days after I was promised one, I still have not received a return shipping label from Jawbone for my exchange. I am really disappointed with this process and am returning my Jawbone to Amazon. I'm really frustrated because I think I am probably in the minority with this defective hardware but I don't want to risk going through this process again.\n\n---\n\nI love the concept of being able to easily capture information about my day to day. Aesthetically, I think it looks better than competitors and that it is wearable rather than something you have to clip to clothing.\n\nAfter the initial release of the Up, I was ready to buy but held off based on widespread reports of hardware failure. After the second wave of the Up was released I was keen to give it a shot. Unfortunately, at least in my case, it seems the hardware problems have not been resolved.\n\nI have a Jawbone Up which I received and began using December 24. It worked for approximately 6 hours and synced successfully but now about five minutes after each sync goes into the ""lost clock"" condition with the LED just pulsing various clocks when the button is pressed. Occasionally the band will be completely unresponsive and no LED with display when the button is pressed.\n\nWith only one successful sync, I really don't feel like I can comment further on the capabilities of the Up. Mine simply didn't function. The best thing I can say is that it is comfortable.\n\nI'm going to do one exchange before just returning. Will update if it's actually functional.\n\nUpdate 1:\n\nI've been working with Jawbone Support to secure a replacement. The customer support is courteous but it is a long process. Even after detailing the troubleshooting steps I have taken I was required to run the full battery again over the phone with a Jawbone rep before being allowed to exchange the device.\n\nUpdate 2:\n\nJawbone missed the first window I set up to walkthrough troubleshooting. I was issued a reference number to use to call them at my convenience but this unfortunately also entailed waiting on hold for about 10 minutes. In the end it took about 20 minutes from placing the call to the rep from Jawbone (who was very polite and pleasant) to agree to accept a return of the band. They said it was likely a hardware issue based on the symptoms and attributed it to being possibly ""roughed up"" in shipping.\n\nI'll now be receiving an email with instructions for submitting my Amazon receipt then will be sent a prepaid shipping label. After they receive my old Jawbone, they apparently will be shipping me a new one overnight.\n\nI will update again after being able to use the replacement.\n\nUpdate 3:\n\n48 hours after submitting a Amazon receipt I have yet to receive a shipping label but have submitted a request for an update from Jawbone.";Incredibly frustrating exchange process, returned in the end despite wanting to love it.
124;13.0;3.0;133.0;I was drawn to this device because of the wristband which is its best feature.  (I also have a Fitbit and Zeo). The Up is comfortable and attractive.  This device is great at tracking steps. Anything using more exertion you will need to log in. The sleep function is state of the art for what it is but please understand that there is no device (absent electroids at the sleep clinic) that can accurately measure levels of sleep - or even if you are sleeping vs. laying still in bed. But, looking at what it has recorded combined with your own awareness of your sleep patterns, gives you a decent amount of knowledge with which to work (for whatever it's worth). The one function I did not like was the food logging. It is not very user friendly compared to the Fitbit.  It is especially cumbersome to go back and log food for a previous meal or previous day.  And it is also not easy to adjust the serving sizes. So, bottom line - great activity monitor, great sleep monitor (such as it is) but poor food logger. If you are looking logging food as your chief reason to have one of these, go with the Fitbit.;Great for logging steps, not for logging food
70;14.0;1.0;100.0;Bought this originally straight from jawbone in Decemeber, even paid an extra $20 have it expedited because I was so excited for it. Also owned and used the Fitbit One and Nike Fuelband. But the UP was my favorite. I much prefer the design of the band, and the app interface was really awesome and the sleep and activity tracking was a more accurate that fitbit. Also a major benefit Jawbone lets you download your information in spreadsheet form from the website, awesome\n\n30 days later the band was dead. dead dead dead. tired all the reseting stuff,then had to pay the $10 to mail back for exchange. Received the replacement a few weeks later. It worked for 2 months this time and then one day it's battery stopped holding a charge, instead of lasting for 10 days, it lasts for about 10 hours. So know I have a band that I have to plug in and charge twice daily, which is a joke. I had originally reccomended this over the UP to some friends and their's all became non-funcitoning at some point. It's a disaster.\n\nPlease improve the product, I was happy to pay $130 and singing the praises of this product until it failed me. It's hard for me to love something that doesn't actually work most of the time.;2 bands, 2 dead batteries
95;15.0;1.0;95.0;This band is simply flawed.  My first band stopped working.  Jawbone agreed that the band needed to be replaced.  They used pony express to send me a new band a week or 2 later.  2nd band worked great for a month.  2nd band just stopped working too.  Jawbone agreed that this band needed to be replaced too.  They said it was crazy odds that I would get a second dud.  Pony express is currently on it's way to me with my 3rd replacement band.  Should be here next week.  My advice to the consumer- wait for the fitbit band and hope that they figured out the technology.  My advice to Jawbone - call it.  Your second attempt didn't work - give people their money back.  (I asked that before my second replacement, figuring if it broke within the first 2 weeks I should just get a refund) but Jawbone refused my refund because I bought it from Best Buy.;On 3rd Replacement Band
97;16.0;1.0;89.0;I loved my UP band. Very motivating, if not a little frustrating to sync, but I could look past that. Then came the charging issues. I'd soft-reset, I'd hard-reset, I'd position the charger in just the perfect position, I'd blow into the charger like it was NES, 1985. What would happen? Once in a blue moon, it would actually charge. The other times it would sit there, happily blinking away as if it were charging. But no ... it thought it was charging, but was merely telling me it was plugged in, using up battery power to flash it's little light. I nicknamed it the liar-light.\n\nI contacted support, reporting the problems and what I had done to fix the problems. I was told to reset it.\n\nThankfully, I got my money back.;Loved it, while it lasted
121;17.0;1.0;77.0;It is really unreliable.  I have now had mine for 3 weeks, and I have had it on every day and night.  I am discouraged and am switching products.  On several occasions I have gone on walks for over 30 minutes.  When I sync, my stats say longest active period 5 minutes, and 700 steps for the whole day.  When you are looking for ways to encourage yourself, these kinds of set backs are really disappointing and in this case expensive.\n\nIt is a commitment to wear this band day and night.  It is not small, and is not a fit for business wear.  You will need to be able to have a causal look to be able to pull it off.\n\nThe only thing that has worked consistently is the alarm.  I like waking to a soft vibration on my wrist, but I now don't trust the sleep stats.\n\nIn short, stats are great but only when accurate and reliable.  I am going to try others because I believe it can be a great help and motivator.  But as for this one, save your money.;Disappointed - replacing with the Fitbit One
91;18.0;1.0;74.0;I wanted to buy this product from Amazon but it was always out of stock, so I purchased it directly from Jawbone.\n\nTHE GOOD --\n\nThe bracelet came in a nice box and was packaged well. The bracelet already had about a 50% charge so I was able to use it right away. The iPhone app is amazing (although the food tracking could be better) and it was easy to use. The bracelet had many features that made it fit my lifestyle.\n\nTHE BAD --\n\nUnfortunately, the bracelet died after about 3 weeks. I researched how to reset it and tried everything I could find and it would still not work. I emailed support. At first they were very helpful and responded back within hours. They responded teling me different ways to reset and force restore the bracelet. I tried all of these methods and none of them worked. They then responded saying that if that didn't work it was verified broken. They sent me a pre-paid postage slip and said they would ship me a new one. I packaged up the bracelet in the original box with all the original items shipped to me.\n\nAfter they received the bracelet it took them about 2 weeks to get one shipped to me. The new one finally arrived... but it was nothing but a beat up bracelet in an envelope. No charger, no original box, no nothing. The battery was also completely dead. Because I couldn't charge it, I couldn't use it... not to mention it had scuff marks all over it and the cap didn't stay on right. It seemed that they sent me back a broken used one.\n\nWhen I emailed customer support explaining the issue this time around, they took 3 days to get back. When they finally got back they apologized and offered to ship me a charger. I declined and stated I'd rather a refund since this one didn't' appear in good shape. THen they went silent. I emailed them 3 times over the next week and a half and got no response. Finally I called and they claimed I needed to just simply mail it back to them. Once they receive it, they will process my refund.\n\nI'll update this once I get my money back or the process is over.\n\nAll in all, it was a decent bracelet, but even the rep I talked to on the phone said they were swamped with people retuning theirs and that department was really busy. It looks like this version didn't get much better than the version 1. I'd say I'll hang around for a version 3, but there are other better products out there that I'll probably give a try.;Verified broken after 3 weeks - Customer Support semi-helpful

Seems like even after having to recall all first gen version, this new generation 2 product still has major issues.  The are charging customers shipping costs to replace all of these defective bands.  Very disappointing product.\n\nAdding to my review,  have now been through 2 UP bands since January, just had another one fail in the same manner,  won't charge or sync, tried all manner of resets etc.  There is something very wrong with the reliability of these devices.

76;21.0;1.0;63.0;"Bought my band in November 2012 and I loved it for the first 2 months until the black rubber began to stretch and crack. It finally got to the point where the cap would not fit and I could not charge or sync without holding the band forcefully in place. Contacted Jawbone customer service  - was told they had never seen this before and they offered to send me a replacement band. It seemed like a simple enough fix.  Unfortunately, it took almost 2 weeks to get to me as they sent it via ground from CA to NY and to top it all off they sent me a medium to replace a large band. In the interim I found out that I was not the only one experiencing this stretching and cracking issue. On a whim, upon contacting them regarding the size mistake I inquired about getting a Navy band vs the Black on the hopes that the Navy rubber might be a better batch etc.\n\nThe good news: 3 weeks in and the Navy replacement band did not stretch etc.\n\nThe bad news: My band suddenly would not hold a charge for more than a few hours despite receiving a full charge and showing 10 days of battery life etc. This occurred every day for about a week no matter what I tried (soft reset, hard reset etc).\n\nThe really bad news: After being forced to charge my band every night (defeating 1/2 the purpose of the band - sleep tracking) my UP band turned into a brick. It is absolutely dead - no lights, wil not charge and will not sync!\n\nI reviewed Jawbone Support for ""band not charging"" and they suggested doing a soft reset and a hard reset. Ironically both options require the band to have some power to perform the resets. The hard reset instructions literally state to make sure your band is charged. I tried every option and suggestion posted but nothing made a difference.\n\nAmazingly, I bought this to help monitor and improve my health but at the end of the day it has only served to raise my blood pressure.\n\nThe question for me is will a third band be a charm or is it time to move on? I am awaiting a response from Jawbone support and will update my review accordingly. However, given my previous recommendation to so many friends when I first got my band I feel obligated to post this review given the current reality of the Jawbone Up Band. The bottom line from my perspective is that despite my so badly wanting (almost willing) this product to simply work I do not think it is ready for ""prime time"". This is Jawbone's 2nd generation band and was hyped and promised to be fully redesigned, tested and ready for ""prime time"" but given my experience and the others I was made aware of  I would recommend waiting for Generation 3.";Not Ready for Prime Time
96;22.0;1.0;55.0;"//Update\n\nMy second Jawbone UP has stopped working just a little over 90 days after getting it. Save your money folks, this product is not ready for prime time.\n\n//original review follows:\n\nI purchased a black onyx size large Jawbone UP the week they became available.  At the time they were only available at Apple stores.  I had been waiting for the re-design as I had narrowly avoided getting the 1st iteration of the UP which was ultimately plagued with major reliability issues, resulting in Jawbone issuing a statement that the release of that product had been an inadvertent beta program.\n\nI have wanted a fitness tracker for a while, and had looked at the Fitbit, Nike Fuelband and others before deciding that the UP seemed to offer the fewest compromises for what I am after.... a fitness tracker that is water resistant, that will track sleep habits and that I ""wear"" so that I won't lose it.\n\nI got my UP on release week at a local Apple store.  I guessed at the size, but the Large size fits me pretty well.  Interestingly the bracelet was initially somewhat snug but loosened up after a couple of days of regular wear.  Setting it up with my iPhone was very easy.  I simply downloaded the application onto my phone, disconnected the cap on the UP and plugged it into the headphone jack of my iPhone.  I ran through the setup fairly quickly and was up and running.\n\nAs a pedometer, the UP works fairly well.  Step counting and distance traveled is reasonably accurate although it is unfortunate that it can't track elevation changes, such as how many stairs you have climbed, or if you are climbing a mountain.  As a result of this, you can be rapidly hiking a steep hill, breathing hard and sweating a ton, but since UP only looks at how quickly you are covering ground it will report that you've been undertaking a ""light"" activity.  Ha!\n\nOn the subject of activities.  UP gives you the ability to time an activity through a key sequence with the single button on the wristband, but I found the feature lacking.  In bright Colorado sun it was impossible to see the flashing light that tells you if an activity has started, and as a result, on at least a couple of occasions I had not activated the ""timed activity mode"" properly, instead putting the wristband into ""night/sleep"" mode.  It would be nice if they used a brighter LED or a vibration sequence for activity begin and a different one for activity end so that you could be a little more confident that it's tracking what you want.\n\nUP also gives you the ability to manually enter an activity, such as aerobics, weight lifting, elliptical machine, etc.  The list is pretty comprehensive, but I found that the calorie counts it came up with didn't match up with what my Precor reported.  You can slide your finger up and down on the activity to rate the difficulty of the workout, and UP will roughly adjust the calorie count, but it would be nice to simply  input the calories, in the event you are using a piece of gym equipment that gives you a more precise number.\n\nUP lets you set goals for ""moving"" and ""sleeping"" and then tells you if you've hit those goals when you sync the wristband up.  Unfortunately it does not add the equivalent ""move"" benefit from your inputted activities, so if you've sat on your butt most of the day, but then finished out the afternoon with a grueling 90 minutes on the elliptical machine, UP will still show that you've not hit your move goal.\n\nThe UP does now have the ability to post your workouts or activities via Twitter and Facebook which is a step in the right direction.  Originally it could not do that, which was disappointing.  It also has a ""calorie tracker"" that you can use to input your meals, but unless you know the calorie count of everything you eat (or everything you eat comes from one of a select number of fast food joints or coffee shops) it seems like a bit of a gimmick to me.\n\nWhat the UP does that is useful is give you a good idea of how much you've moved around in a day.... so, for me, it's a good way to prioritize workouts.  If I move 10,000-12,000 steps in a day then I might feel less guilty about putting a workout off.  If I've moved well under the goal value then I know I really need the extra gym time.  The sleep tracking is somewhat useful but I don't know that I believe the UP, as at times I've woken up and been awake for a few minutes, and UP never notices this.  It is handy for telling me how long it takes to get to sleep, it would be nice to be able to export that kind of data over an entire month... something you can't do with UP today.\n\nI had my first UP for just two months when it started to act funny.  It was having trouble syncing, and one night when I switched it in to night mode it sort of gave a feeble buzz and died.  It was completely dead and nothing Jawbone support had me try could bring it back.  This was VERY disappointing to me as this is reminiscent of what users were reporting with the first generation product.  In my case, although I had showered and washed my hands with the ""water resistant"" UP (which they say is fine), I had never abused it or done anything unusual to it.  About the worst abuse that it got was getting snagged and twisted on a pillow or sheet when I moved around while sleeping or when slipping a jacket on.\n\nAnother thing that I had noticed with my UP is that after just the two months of use the bracelet was starting to look somewhat worn out.  Some kind of plastic film was peeling away from the band and the cap looked like it had been run over with a truck.... the finish was being worn away just by the sweat of my fingers removing and reseating it... leaving cheap looking plastic showing through.\n\nIt took about a full 2-3 weeks for me to get my replacement UP.  Unfortunately you must mail the defective one back at your own expense (sans any accessories) and wait on their RMA department to ship you a replacement.  I'm still using it but I'm not optimistic about the lifespan of these guys.  I got in just under the wire with the warranty too.  You'd think that with the poor reputation the first revision had that Jawbone would have bumped it up on these new ones, especially considering the roughly 30% price bump they applied to the MSRP.\n\nConsidering the increase in MSRP you'd think that they would have given it a solid 1 year warranty, or included a spare cap (you're sure to lose the original one and they want an insane $10 for a replacement), or given it bluetooth.\n\nI'm not sure if I would be happier with Fitbit or Fuelband either... as mediocre as it is, the UP is still probably the best fit for me, at least until someone (Apple?) develops a smart watch that has all of the functionality of the UP built in, obsoleting the sucker.\n\nThe way I look at it, these devices today are just scratching the surface of what is possible with biometric tracking and the next generation or two of these devices will make us glad that we had to pitch these ones in the trash can after a short time.";Fragile, just like the first Jawbone UP!  Overpriced
116;23.0;5.0;56.0;"This is an amazing little device.  It's extremely lightweight and comfortable.  It does NOT change in shape and size.  I have a 7"" wrist and the medium fits perfectly and stays secure on my wrist.\n\nOut of the box, I used my GPS and ran 6.2 miles.  The UP registered that I had run 8.2 miles.  I used this run as a calibration.  Since calibrating the device, it hasn't been off by more than 1/10th of a mile for every 10 miles run.  It really will only work with step workouts, but if you're a runner that's what you really need anyway.  There are multiple options for other exercises.  However, I tried it on the rowing machine and realized quickly the best way to log that workout is manually.\n\nAs far as the sleep function goes, it is simply amazing.  There are almost certainly better sleep trackers in a hospital, but sleeping with electrodes all over you isn't really feasible.  I tested this function by examining how I felt for the first two hours after sleep BEFORE syncing the device and altering my assessment.  In nearly every case over the course of three weeks, the amount of sleep/deep sleep/ and times woke up corresponded directly with how tired I had rated myself as being.\n\nThe waterproof claim is great so far.  I sweat like a pig when I run and have had no problems with sweat ruining the device.  I wash my hands while wearing it constantly and again, no problems.  Additionally, I have showered in it a couple times, also without problems. The problems since the 1st gen mostly seem to be fixed.  I haven't had any problems with the cap falling off, the waterproof claim seems valid, and I haven't had any malfunctions with the device.\n\nThe food logging aspect is the only area that I think needs some work.  The scan, picture, or manually search and enter functions are all there and easy to use but it seems to take me more time than an old app I was using where everything was manual search and enter.\n\nOverall, if you're dedicated to regularly wearing the device (you'll barely notice it after a day or so), if you're really going to examine your life and make changes, and if you're willing to calibrate the device, there is nothing out there that's better to track your lifestyle.\n\nFinal note - there have been a lot of complaints about this not syncing wirelessly.  For me, the plug and synce feature is awesome.  I don't carry my phone with me all the time and this will record data until you're near your phone again and able to sync.  It also means that you can go for a little more than a week between charges on the UP.  It also means that you won't be charging your iPhone three times a day in order to compensate for constant wireless syncing.\n\nAWESOME GADGET!";Amazing device, especially after a good calibration.

I was seriously into weightlifting and cardio but over the years I have suffered knee injuries and severe IBS. Slowly I let my body go...but now I want to get back in the game. I needed some extra motivation and when I heard of this band last year I wanted to go buy it, but it was recalled due to manufacturing defects. Now a year later Jawbone has released the 2nd gen UP. They released it on 13th November on their website but it's shipping in December and here on Amazon they are temporarily out of stock(whatever that means), best buy is going to get it in December so just on a hunch I stopped by my local Apple store and they had two pieces in large size(my size) one in black and the other in pistachio green. I bought the black one. Now one day later I definitely think it will help me. I am not sure how accurate this is but I am guessing this is more accurate in telling calories you burned compared to the Nike fuel band which I did get but returned it due to its weird system by measuring its own made up measure ""fuel points"". The thing I liked about the Nike Fuel band is you could use it as a watch for telling time as it had led lights. This does not have that but this also measures your sleep quality and with the help of the iOS app you can log what you are eating through out the day and your activities. If you want to remain active you can set it to nudge at certain intervals of inactivity. Also it can wake you up at an optimum time in your sleep cycle around the time you have set the alarm for. One major drawback is that you have to sync it by plugging it in your phone's audio jack. Jawbone is a bluetooth company, and had also the 1st gen of UP band to learn from. So why no bluetooth? There is another competitive product called lark life band available for preorder selling for $30 more which has the functionality of syncing wirelessly through bluetooth but it comes with another night band. Having different day and night bands did not seem feasible to me and plus it's not yet on the market.. I had a shower with UP, seems to be waterproof as the company says but let see how it holds up. Another thing that bugs me is the cap that you have to constantly remove so that you can sync it with your phone. I hope the cap does not become loose or worse, I carelessly loose it. This is just an initial review I will definitely update this review after a few weeks with it. Hopes this helps all of you who are considering buying this product and seeking some insight.\n\nUpdate 1-Also wish this had a altimeter like fitbit one to measure if u r climbing a slope or stairs to more accurately measure calories burned. I forgot to state in the video that you can measure your calorie intake by recording your daily food intake or just snap pictures of your food and have a picture food journal. Overall I have no major issues yet to report and am still sticking with a lenient four star review, as I think we will see a more development with such products in the near future. The purpose of this product seems not to just look at the activities and calorie intake of one day at a time, but rather a comparative and progressive approach to measure the progress from the past days/weeks etc.\n\nUpdate 2- Have had it almost a week now and must say that I have been increasingly become more active everyday. There are some minor concerns I would like to report. Firstly, the band tends to become wider and loose over time. The reason being this does not have a clipping mechanism such as the nike fuel bracelet . It is just 1 strip of spring steel that you are suppose to widen to get your hand in or out of it, depending if you are removing it to sync or wearing it back. This constant removal and putting on of the band along with the fact that the band naturally slides towards your elbow (down your wrist) makes the band more loose over time. Jawbone should have had a bracelet clipping mechanism. Also as far as the iOS app is concerned you can form teams with your friends who have the band and compare your sleep/activities/ food intake with them but cannot compete/add  unknown people who share the same goal as you and  a major drawback is there is no 3rd party app integration with more commonly used finess apps such as my fitness pal, lose it, daily burn, nike + and many more. Also there is no way to input you desired weight and the app itself does not adjust the calories you should burn/eat incase you are losing weight. Also another factor taken out of the equation is heart rate. I would expect a fitness bracelet worn on the wrist especially to detect heart rate since heart rate has a direct correlation with calories burned. The app lacks many features although the UI is nice I am amazed there is no integration with social networks like facebook and twitter. Also it is only compatible with iphone(although I am not complaining), many of my friends have android and no support yet. There also no way to sync your device with a mac/pc and no online support for storing/ seeing your band info incase you don't have an iphone/android. Fitbit has a big advantage over this as fitbit devices support macs/pc, have an online syncing tool and have many 3rd party app integration. Also another drawback is there is no way to set multiple alarms. Really in this day and age we don't have the same schedule everyday. If I have to wake up at 8 am on monday I have to sync it with the phone to change the alarm if I have to wake up at 6 am on tuesday. Overall I hope Jawbone really steps up the game especially on their software side - apps as the hardware limitations will be there till they decide to release a 3rd gen up band. As I said before one other competitor Jawbone has to watch out for is the larklife band. The battery life is great and should last you 9-10 days.";This is the future of healthcare and this is the beginning...the only way to go is UP!!!
71;25.0;5.0;31.0;I love my UP.\n\nI have now had it for like 3 months or so, and it has helped me lose 20 lbs.\n\nObviously, I already wanted to lose the weight, but this is like a personal assistant to help you meet your health goals.\n\nIt does a good job of motivating you.\n\nI have heard stories of these bands not being reliable.  One of my friends has had to send his in for repair.  I have not had any issues, but for what its worth, I do not shower or swim or do anything with the band that might get it wet.\n\nLastly, If you let the charge drop below 10% sometimes its finnicky to recharge.  So always keep it over 20% charged.\n\nIm still giving it 5 stars, because ive been trying to (Wanting, not really trying) to lose weight forever, and UP has really finally gotten me into better health habits.\n\nThanks UP!;Life Changing
2;26.0;5.0;33.0;"This bracelet is absolutely amazing. The UP APP works perfectly with my iPhone 5. I've really be able to dive into my sleeping schedule and adjust habits to help me sleep better at night. The UP bracelet is dead on for my workouts on the treadmill. Tracking distance, speed, and calories burned to a ""T"". I couldn't be more happy with my purchase, its definitely helping me hit my fitness goals. Can't wait until my friends get one so we can compete!";It's worth the price just for the sleep features.
104;27.0;1.0;32.0;I wanted this thing to work, I really did. It actually did function fine for about 2 months. Woke up one morning and it was dead, not charging, not syncing, nothing. I was extremely careful, no showers/water, no extreme twisting, and no bumps. Checked Jawbones forums for a fix yesterday to see that they are failing in droves...Just like their 1st generation...Argh...Don't waste  your time or money, returning is a PITA and they make you pay for the return shipping...Very disappointing.;These things are dying by the bucket full, including mine...DO NOT BUY
1;28.0;4.0;30.0;"I had the first generation UP band by Jawbone, eventually killing it while snowboarding.  I've watched the launch of Fitbits and Fuelbands but nothing quite had everything I was looking for.  When I saw the new, revised Up bands in an Apple Store in mint green (a true Celeste green, for you bike nerds out there), my Amex was out and ready to rock.\n\nThe killer app for me is really the sleep monitoring and alarm in a handy form factor.  I need to be up and out the door before my husband, so having an alarm that will wake me and not the rest of the house is critical.  The vibrate level is just right: insistent without being jarring like a blaring alarm clock.  I'm an active sleeper so it tends towards the earlier range of the ""light sleep"" cycle for me, but that's more of an individual problem.\n\nThe lack of Bluetooth is a bonus in my situation.  I work in environments where I may not necessarily be able to dump a BT signal all over the place, and syncing with the headphone jack is not nearly the imposition others might have you believe.  I typically sync in my office while I'm waiting for my work laptop to come out of sleep and pull email.  It's trivial and straightforward and worth losing the bulk and energy drain of a BT transmitter for.\n\nAside from the loss of the blue LED for sleep mode, which is a negligible problem in my opinion, my complaints are mostly software-related with the app.  The minty green color seems to pick up dirt quickly, but that would be a problem with a normal mint green bracelet that I wore constantly too.  Not really a design flaw.  It does not look stupid in a professional environment with a suit jacket.\n\nThe app is a little annoying for layout, and is missing weight tracking; weight tracking and more prominent calorie metrics would release me from having to dual enter data into Livestrong's MyPlate app.  It should support landscape-mode looks at the charts, and more options in the Trends section so that you can see correlations more easily.  I'm hopeful for future releases.\n\nIt's worth noting for my fellow data junkies that you can get the raw data dumps from your Up band off of the Jawbone website underneath your account settings.  Plenty of opportunity for data crunching on a subject you should be very familiar with-- you!\n\nLike everyone, I'm hoping that Jawbone has actually solved the water permeability issues from the previous incarnation, but I'm optimistic about where the new Up band could go.  Tweaking the software would definitely be a great place to go.";First-gen Up Band user back for more.
14;29.0;1.0;18.0;I am totally dissatisfied with this product. Every two months the bracelet malfunctioned and was replaced , the last time I gave up complaining and asked for my money back but the company ( JAWBONE ) requested that I asked that you contact amazon.com .\nnot recommend this product to anyone because it does not work , and presents problems aa every two months .\ndo not buy it !!!\nAs you can see I have 3 and none work;DO NOT BUY IT
94;30.0;1.0;22.0;This is what I get for thinking a simple band can do it all.\n\nThe guy/gal who designed the packaging for the band deserves an award it is so cool.\n\nThe guy/gal who invented the band should have to deal with every customer compliant personally for the rest of his/her life.\n\nI should have known this was not going to work when the band said I had already taken 19 steps before I even put the band on.  From there the counts just got worse.  My fist day I was slammed with work and hardly moved all day but the band says I took over 1000 steps.  That night I went to bed and got a lousy 3.5 hours of sleep.  The band says I got 33.\n\nThe next day I took a walk and calibrate the band to be fair.  Calibration after a one mile run didn't take.  So I walk the mile back to my house and again the measurements don't calibrate.  That night I got an amazing 8 hours of sleep.  The band says 28.\n\nI can't reset the band.  It won't reboot no matter what I try.  Don't even try the erase function, you may start to cry with frustration.\n\nAs an added bonus this evening it started to vibrate at random intervals on my commute home and ever since.\n\nDay 3 - the band goes back and I count myself lucky to gain back my sanity.;The Jawbone Up is a complete let Down
29;31.0;2.0;19.0;"Let me tell you why this is only a two star product:\n\nI absolutely loved my jawbone up 2. I did a lot of research before hand and determined this was the best based on other reviews. It had More accurate step counts, easy to time activities, and track sleep. The app is well designed and easy to use. It was exactly what I needed to stay motivated. However, the band battery keeps dying (charge lasts less than a few hours). I had read several reviews like this prior to purchasing my band but assumed it was just a defective band (since 100% of bands can't be 100% perfect). However, my third band (since June of this year) just died.  Same issue as the other two, battery won't hold a charge. This happened just 1 month after my second replacement. My first band died just 2 months after having it. I have to believe there is a design flaw. There just can't be anyway that three bands have had the same issue.  The worst part of the whole process is being without a working band. It takes at least three weeks to receive the replacement part. You have to email jawbone. They respond the next day and ask you stupid questions like did you troubleshoot it using the hard or soft reset methods. They provide a link to the instructions even if you tell them you tried that. So you have to tell them that didn't work. After that they ask you questions and I quote\n""How do you charge your UP band?\nHave you ever received a replacement charger?\nDo you have a friends computer or charger you could try charging your band on.""\nAfter you respond, they ask for your mailing address, so you respond. And then they email you back confirming the address. Two to three days later they say they are processing your return. Two days after that they print the mailing label. The day after that they actually ship it. Once it ships, it takes between 7-10 days to actually receive it.\n\nSo after my third one, I'm done with Jawbone. I asked for a refund bc that's in their warranty policy. (If Jawbone, in its sole discretion, determines it is not reasonable to replace the defective Product, Jawbone may refund to Consumer the purchase price paid for the Product. [...] ). They won't refund my money. Also, they won't upgrade me to the up 24. The customer service is worst than Comcast and that's saying a lot. When the product worked, I absolutely loved it but it is not worth the hassle of warranty claims.";Defective product, cool idea
74;32.0;4.0;20.0;"I'm not rating how the Jawbone Up works, because I don't yet know.  I'm just letting everyone know that I ordered one of these and it wouldn't charge properly - the indicator pulsed red and then held steady red and the unit wouldn't turn on.  Amazon, in their usual excellent way, exchanged it quickly for another new unit.  That one also wouldn't charge properly.  I'm an electrical engineer and I've designed battery powered consumer products, so this isn't a case of user error.  Neither product would charge.  I suspect that Amazon will see a lot of returns on this batch of Jawbone Ups.\nI still want one, so I'm going to buy it from Jawbone directly.  About the same price and free delivery.  Hopefully, I'll get one from a different production run.\n\nUPDATE: I received my new Jawbone Up directly from Jawbone.  It acted EXACTLY like the two from Amazon.  I called Jawbone support and they walked me through the secret steps needed to get it to work.  I may be breaking the secrecy rules of Jawbone (none of this is in the ""User Guide"" that comes with the Up and some of what is called out in the guide is not correct), but here goes:\nSome of this was explicitly stated by Jawbone support and some of it is guesswork based on my experience.\n1. The Soft Reboot often works better if you plug the Up into the USB cable before you plug the cable into the USB port (stated by Jawbone support).  It didn't help in my case.\n2. The Hard Reboot didn't work for my Up, but that's okay - it won't necessarily work until the Up is first made functional (my guess).  My Up (and the two that preceded it) did not, I suspect, have working software in the microcontroller, so it wasn't able to correctly respond to either reboot technique.  They both require a working micro.\n3. My Up wouldn't sync with the app.  The app would not detect the Up.\n4. Jawbone support directed me to ensure that the volume limit was disabled under Settings on my iPhone (iPhone 5).  It was already disabled, so no help here.\n5. Jawbone support directed me to turn off Bluetooth as it often disrupts the communications between the Up and the app.  I turned off the Bluetooth and they sync'ed very nicely.\n6. After syncing, my Up works correctly.  I suspect that the app is able to update the firmware in the Up's micro and load in correctly working code.  This is a nice feature as it allows Jawbone to fix any bugs that are found over time and to install new features or improve old ones.\n\nNote:  My wife's blue Up has both green (for day) and blue (for night) indicators as well as the red (for charging).  My black Up has only green (for day and night) and red (for charging).  For some reason, Jawbone doesn't include blue indicators for the black Up - go figure.\n\nI'm raising the rating to two stars.  After I use the Up for a while, I'll update again.\n\nUpdate:  I've been using the Up for about a month now and I like it a lot.  I still don't understand why my wife's blue Up has different colored LEDs than my black one, or why the LED's seem to respond differently.  The Up doesn't track steps as accurately as the FitBit, but it tracks upper body movement that the FitBit completely misses.  And I like the sleep tracking feature - I now know how much sleep I'm actually getting (a lot less than I would have guessed).  I've never liked wearing a watch because they feel uncomfortable on my wrist, but the Up feels fine.  It doesn't bother me at all. I'm raising the rating to four stars.";The first two seemed bad, but probably weren't and I really like the third one
48;33.0;1.0;18.0;"Even though you may be reading this on Amazon's site, do NOT buy this product from Amazon.com, if you absolutely MUST buy this.\n\nHere's why.\n\nThe Jawbone UP band I purchased died - would not charge - after the return window for the band closed. So, I was only left with calling Jawbone support. They will only issue refunds for bands purchased from THEIR OWN ONLINE STORE. So, after two instances where the band died suddenly I was told the following:\n\n1) I was using the band ""improperly"" by letting it run all the way down to no charge\n2) By letting it charge overnight - more than 80 minutes, I may have ""fried"" the band\n\nJawbone is willing to replace the band for me, under warranty, for the second time. At this rate I will go through three to five bands before the warranty is ""UP."" So, here's a $129 device that requires a LOT of attention. You have to bring a charger with you when you are out hiking, like I was yesterday, or risk having the band die. You have to pay close attention to the amount of charging time lest you ""fry"" the band by leaving it connected to the charger for too long.\n\nI have a lot of battery operated devices. None require such attention. The ""UP"" is supposed to be a lifestyle device, but I am unwilling to alter my lifestyle to keep this device working - I'd rather throw it out.\n\nI have asked Jawbone support for a refund. They refused. I have asked for a credit towards another Jawbone product - I was offered a 25% discount off of another purchase from their store. I refused. I have asked for a $129 credit on their store, and am waiting to hear - will update this review when they get back to me.\n\nTo Amazon:\n\nyou really should stop selling these, as the support / remedies you can provide are lesser than Jawbone will provide to their own customers. This puts your customers at an extreme disadvantage, so I would take these off of Amazon.com - as this is not the good experience Amazon customers expect.\n\nUPDATE 11/7/2013\n\nJawbone did eventually issue me a credit for the purchase amount which I applied to one of their Jambox products. However, the process took two months and was painful - I had to call over ten times.";Buyer Beware! Do NOT buy from Amazon!
117;34.0;2.0;20.0;"Edited review: Since my first review earlier in the year, I have to downgrade this device to two stars. Like many others, my UP band has officially died before it was even a year old. I never took my UP in the shower or swimming, but after about 1 month of sitting in a drawer when I took a break from using it due to my travel needs, I noticed a significant build-up of rust around the headphone/charging jack and inside the endcap. The band stopped working correctly and would no longer take a hard or soft reset and only the red sun would light up on the band. Jawbone is sending me a warranty replacement, so we will see how long this one lasts. Sadly, they have not figured out how to really make a ""fitness"" product that can hold up to regular daily use.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nI've been using the UP for about one month now. Overall, it is a solid product and mechanically does what it says it will do quite well. After calibration, it records my steps very accurately (checked against a digital pedometer and known distance). The sleep tracking feature is great, and I love the smart alarm designed to wake you within 30 min of your set time while you are in light sleep. The inactivity alarm is really nice too. I am getting a consistent 7 to 8 days of charge time out of it (with daily smart alarm and inactivity alarms and occasional stopwatch use) and I use it to the point that it tells me it has about one day of power left.\n\nThe reason why I give this three stars is the iPhone app interface. Once you get over how pretty it is, you start to see its problems that Jawbone could have tackled prior to bringing this back to market. Here are a few:\n\n-In many of the graphs, there is no Y-axis, so it is hard to see the total trend in the data and you have to manually click on bars to see what values are what, and at other times you can only see the most current data numbers for the current day and have to guess at what the other days are exactly. Luckily, you can download your data from the Jawbone website as a .csv file for export into Excel. However, Jawbone doesn't make it easy or intuitive...you have to dig into the user forums to figure this stuff out.\n\n-Food logging is incredibly hokey and cumbersome. Trust me, download MyFitnessPro (free) to see what a great food diary/calorie counter app with a very deep food database should look like. If only Jawbone had been a bit more forward thinking and developed the API to interface with other apps like this, I would be elated.\n\nIf you are on the fence about this product and can wait, you should hold out to see how good the FitBit Flex will be. It seems that it will provide more features than the UP and cost less. This is an emerging market and the competition is heating up, so you may want to wait to see what is just a few months ahead and you may have a much better product to work with.\n\n-Update: Jawbone has now released a new version of the iPhone app. (early Feb. 2013) that provides multiple smart alarms, and immediate viewing of data even when not connected to a network. I can now give this four stars since these were big previous gripes for me. The only down-side is really the form factor. The band catches very easily on sweater and coat sleeves, so if you live in a cold climate where you will be wearing a lot of clothing like this, it can get a bit annoying after a while, and you can't wear this thing swimming or surfing.";Good, but wait for the FitBit Flex if on the fence
83;35.0;2.0;19.0;Positives:\n\n- Good tracking of meaningful information.  I don't care to log my food intake so I like the simplicity of the App and how the band provides necessary information.\n\n- Customer Service is very prompt and courteous in responding to the many issues I have had with the UP band.\n\nNegatives\n\n- My initial UP band that was a Christmas present from my sister died after 3 months of use.  The replacement band, sent promptly, died after 3 weeks of use.  It just stopped recording data at different intervals during the day.  I tried all of the customer service remedies to no avail.\n\n- I wish the product had a way to show you the steps done on the band itself.  The only way I know that the band died is that I had my idle alert set to 15 minute intervals.  It would be great if the band had a running pedometer on the band itself.\n\nThe plain fact is that the product has so many flaws that it should be recalled.;Good Concept, Good Customer Service, Lousy Product

The cap will soon not fit, because the bunched up material is pushing it outwards.\n\nI really liked the product, but this is very disappointing, and I'm thinking pretty soon this will end up in the trash. $130 bucks down the drain.\n\nP.S.

When I tell them if they take my broken 3 UP bands on trade, they flatly deny it.  I heard that FitBit is going to offer a trade in program of their own.  Trade your broken UP band in for $25 off your next Fitbit!!  At least I'll get something for it.\n\nI'd be happy to join a class action suit  if anyone has started one.

43;40.0;1.0;14.0;Below is the message I sent to Fabiola in Jawbone Support:\n\nThanks for your message of September 10 (about returning the broken UP band that I had purchased via Amazon in July -- reference number 1175684 ). The replacement UP band arrived on Friday, September 20, considerably later than I was expecting. I checked the lights by pushing the end button, and it flashed red on the flower light. Odd, I thought. I tried to sync it with my phone, thinking that it needed to be registered or something. It would not sync. I charged it for several hours, then tried to see if I could get it to switch to sleep-monitor mode. It would not. Again I tried synching it, then charging it, then pushing the button in sequences suggested by the help in the UP application. None of that got it to do what I was expecting.\n\nSo I ordered a Fitbit Flex, which has been working fine since I received it, and I put the replacement UP band aside until today.\n\nI am very disappointed that the first UP band failed in only about five weeks of normal use -- it was great up to that point.\n\nI am extremely disappointed that the replacement sent was nonfunctioning right out of the package. That was actually a shock, coming from a reputable company. I have decided not to waste any more time on a company with such poor quality control.\n\nI am returning both the original and the replacement.\n\nI have already provided the details of the purchase through Amazon. I ask you to refund my purchase price.\n\nI'll be posting these comments on Amazon reviews for the device.\n\nJoel Barna;Quit working after less than two months, and replacement sent by Jawbone was non-functioning right out of the box.
126;41.0;2.0;16.0;"This is a VERY cool band with awesome ideas. BUT they don't give you ANY information pertaining to the fact it is NOT wireless -you need to manually sync it to the app... and it IS NOT a heart rate monitor -you manually have to track your sleep/wake times and it judges your sleep times on the movement of your band so if you wake up in the middle of the night and move itll sense it but if you wake up and don't move then you're out of luck. The ""cat nap"" feature just sets an alarm for you. I can do that with my regular alarm clock for 25min. They make it seem it will time 25min from the time you fall asleep (aka: by heart rate) but thats not true. I was extremely disappointed because it wasn't what they made it seem. Maybe with more information on the website I wouldn't have been so disappointed and possible wouldn't have bought it. I can get the app for free and track my sleep/workouts/stepr on it without needing a $130 pedometer...which would be a great idea if the app didn't make you jump  through so many hoops to add things. it's a 4 step process to add food/workouts! I'm going back to ""my fitness pal"" app and leaving it at that.\n\nThe site really needs more information on it so you can make a more informed decision if you want it or not....most people don't want a $130 pedometer that you have to do everything manually...that's what I say.";glorified pedometer
79;42.0;3.0;15.0;"I used the Jawbone Up for two months before it finally died over the period of a week.  When I purchased the Up, the question in my mind was whether it was just the latest craze or if it is worth the price.  I have a Garmin watch which tracks my activities far more accurately than the Up.  Other Aps which are far less costly can track what you eat.  So the real motivation for my purchase was to track my everyday activity (when I am not purposefully working out) and my sleep.  And here is the strength of the Up band.  While I believe that its tracking of both activity and sleep may not be very accurate at times, the power of using it is that any sort of tracking encourages you to meet the goals for activity and sleep that you set.  I always wondered why I was so tired during the day until Up showed me that I wasn't getting as much sleep as I thought.  I simply wasn't going to bed right away even though in my mind I wasn't delaying getting into bed.  And I found myself walking more during the day to make the 10,000 step goal that I had set.\n\nHowever, I do wish that Jawbone would elaborate about how sleep and activities are tracked so that I can better understand what it is tracking.  As a person who purchased the UP as a means to better understand myself, I find Jawbone's explanation that advanced algorithms are used to be condescending.  Like telling a child that something is too complicated for them to understand.\n\nTechnical Problems\n\nAbout 6 weeks after I started using the Up band, I started having problems.  It started with waking up in the morning and pressing the button on the band to take it out of sleep mode, only to find the band completely dead even though it had a 30% charge the night before.  I charged it fully, but this happened again the next night.  Following the guide on the Jawbone website, I did a soft reset and then a hard reset.  That seemed to work for a few days, but then the Up began to loose activity during the day.  Nothing was recorded.  Then there with problems with the Up being dead in the morning.  I contacted Jawbone technical support and after a two rounds of correspondence over the course of a few days, they told me to return the band to them.\n\nCustomer Support\n\nMy correspondence with Jawbone technical support was good once my Up band began to fail, but several days would pass between when I sent my email and when they responded.  However, they were quick to ask me to return the band for a replacement which I thought was very good.\n\nComfort\n\nI first purchased a medium size band based on the fitting guide which was on the Jawbone website at the time.  When it arrived, I found that the medium fit too snugly, causing the ends of the band to extend up from my wrist rather than being flush.  So, I ordered the large which was too big.  It is always slipping down on my wrist, constricting my movement and causing soreness or bouncing around which is annoying.  I wish that Jawbone had designed the band better so with articulated ends which could be closed around your wrist for a customized fit instead of assuming that everyone could be comfortable with one of three sizes.\n\nI recommend ordering two bands if you are in between sizes so that you can try the fit of both and then return the one that is less uncomfortable.\n\nBattery\n\nJawbone indicates that the battery should last about 10 days.  I usually find that I need to charge the UP band after about 6 days.  I suspect that it really depends on whether or not you have set up alerts which cause the band to vibrate, using power.  Charging the band is easy and usually takes about an hour.  However, you cant charge the band at night since it needs to be plugged in.  I usually charge it when I am at working at my desk.\n\nAndroid Application\n\nI was excited to hear that Jawbone had finally developed an ap for Android.  However, I was very disappointed by the ap once I tried it.  I installed the ap from the Play store and within 90 minutes my phone's battery had been drained significantly.  My phone never goes down in battery life that quickly.  I checked the battery meter and it was the Up ap that had used the battery power.  I uninstalled the ap and the battery drain stopped.\n\nI emailed Jawbone to tell them my experience.  I received a response a few days later which read that the ap shouldnt do that and that I might want to check with my phone's manufacturer.  Which is complete rubbish since all of my other aps run smoothly and it was clearly the Up ap which caused the battery drain problem.\n\nSynching\n\nMy routine is to wake up and plug the UP into my iPod to see how I slept.  I also synched when I got home from work and when I go to bed.  I found it was easy to get into the habit of switching between modes or synching.\n\nSleep Monitoring\n\nI don't know how the UP determines when you are in deep sleep as opposed to light sleep.  The website just says that they use ""advanced algorithms"" to make the calculations.  For me, it would be more helpful to understand how the determination is made so that I can better understand my sleep which is part of the reason why I purchased the up.\n\nIn one instance, I received a telephone call about 30 minutes after I went to bed.  I got out of bed to answer the phone, had a brief conversation and returned to bed agitated.  However, the Up showed no indication that I was up and instead showed me sleeping.  I have the phone record so I know it wasn't a dream so I find it odd that the Up didn't pick it up, especially since I walked around before getting back to bed.\n\nI have found that if you hit the snooze button or if you take a short nap, the UP band will not record that short nap as sleep.  I don't know what the threshold is to get the UP band to actually recognize that you are sleeping, but it seems to be that you must be sleeping longer than 20 minutes.\n\nActivity Monitoring\n\nThe first time that I wore the UP, I hopped on my bike and rode on trails for 1 1/2 hours which included a steep uphill climb.  The UP showed it as being 7000 steps.  The UP isn't like a GPS watch to keep track of distance, nor does it have any way to measure cadence.  So, I wonder how it calculated the steps.  Again, the secret is the ""advanced algorithms""\n\nToday for example, I went for a quick 36 minute run which I tracked using my Garmin watch.  However, UP shows that my longest activity today was only 23 minutes.  I could understand if UP didn't get an accurate indication of my bike rides but to miss active time when I was running?\n\nI wish that you could import exercise data without having to enter it manually.  I use a Garmin watch to keep track of my exercise and the Garmin website can output data files of my activity.  It would have been nice to be able to import the data into the Up application so that I can keep all of my data in one place on the UP.\n\nActivity Alarms\n\nYou can set activity alarms so that the Up vibrates if you sit in one place for too long.  However, it seems that the UP requires a certain number of steps or else it will tell you that you should be moving.  For example, I will be on my feet at work and moving back and forth between desks.  In another case, I will get up from my desk to go to the kitchen down the hall and on the way back, the UP will vibrate.  I appreciate the reminders to move but I do find the alerts to be annoying when they occur when I am moving.\n\nApplication\n\nThere are tips on each day.  During my second week of use, I got a tip that I didn't sleep deeply enough and that I should consider exercising more.  Seeing as I exceed 10,000 steps a day, usually by 10,000 steps including an hour running or biking each day with more on weekends, I found this tip to be really annoying.  It is as if the programmers set UP to look at one statistic without regard for others.  I bought UP to look at the whole picture.  That UP doesnt is a real failure in my opinion.\n\nDiet\n\nIt is possible to record what you eat during the day.  One option is to scan barcodes.  However, as someone who makes most of my own food including bread and pasta from scratch, it is difficult for me to figure out the nutritional values that the ap asks me for.  So this feature is much more readily useful for someone that eats out in places where others have already eaten and entered the nutritional information or someone who eats a lot of microwave dinners.  So overall, this feature was a real disappointment for me.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, a powerful tool for tracking and therefore improving your daily activity and sleep.  However, don't expect a lot from the other functions of the Up ap such as tracking your nutritional intake.  My first Up band had technical problems and had to be returned, but I still plan to purchase a replacement.";Just a fad or a helpful device?  Maybe a bit of both, but mine stopped working after two months
53;43.0;5.0;14.0;"I'll be the first to point out I'm lazy and I procrastinate. I got the UP band because of the Smart Alarm feature. Who doesn't want to wake up in the right time of the sleep cycle rather hitting the snooze button to get just 5 more minutes? The procrastinator in me used to do this oh...until I left myself about 20 minutes to get my dog walked and myself ready to hit the door.\n\nMaya Angelou was right, ""When you know better, you do better.""\n\nUP makes it incredibly EASY to know and do better! Easy = Awesome for us lazy folks. The app shows you how many steps you've taken. Doh! Haven't hit your goal? Start walking! Even if its to your favorite bakery to get a cookie, just start walking. While we're on the subject of cookies, the app makes food choices easy too. Logging your food = knowing what you've eaten! Shock and gasps, I know! You know you want that cookie, so eat the dang cookie!! Just pay attention when that genius app shows you what you can go crazy on, where you need to pay attention and what you should pass on. There are many other way cool fun features like the power nap and logging specific activities to check out, not to mention the correlations you see between your sleep, activity and food. Mind is blown! If you're lazy like me, start small and pay attention to one thing then add to it and pretty soon you find that you're maybe not as lazy as you were 29 days ago.\n\nJoe Nichols was wrong! It was the UP system that made my clothes fall off, not the tequila this time. I'm a 9 to 5'er. I'm talking jean sizes here ladies, not my work day.\n\nMoral of the story is not how smart Maya Angelou is or Joe Nichols is not. The moral here kids is the UP system works, but it takes the band, the app and most importantly....YOU.";Lazy girl loses pants, blames UP system.
40;44.0;1.0;13.0;I broke my 4th UP Band last week. I worked with support on the first 3 bands and they were very responsive. They seemed to be learning with every ticket I submitted and it was getting very simple to receive replacement bands. Each time I submitted a request they seemed genuinely surprised that my band had broken, so I decided to continue with the UP Band.\n\nThis last time I had had enough. My wife's band broke months ago and she is not the type to attempt a customer support request. So that was $130 down the drain. Since it was also my 4th band, I decided to move on and ask for a refund. This is when I was informed that they only process refunds within 60 days. I believe my 4th UP Band was only one to make it past this 60 day term and the fact that I had been trying to make it work with replacement bands did not get me any relief. I had recommended the UP Band to several others and now I feel that I have been duped. Customer Service wants to send me another band that will likely fail in the next 2 months anyway. They will replace your band until your warranty inevitably expires. In short, do not waste your money. I only experienced a hardware failure nightmare since purchasing my first UP Band. Don't make the same mistake I made.;UP hardware failure
72;45.0;2.0;14.0;I like the look of the UP, however my positive experience stops there maybe I was spoiled by the Fitbit products.  First, the pedometer count is off.  I wore my old fitbit one day while wearing my jawboe and the jawbone was 197% higher in step range.  I knew how far I had walked and checked my fitbit and it was dead on. FAIL\n\nThe Jawbone only claims to be accurate on your non dominant hand, which since I am right handed means my watch hand which is terribly uncomfortable so I quit wearing my watch until I returned the Jawbone. FAIL\n\nThe band only comes up to a large, which fits my wrist perfectly, until I start an activity.  It does not conform to your wrist at all and if it twists or moves in any way, it opens up and the two ends stick out ready to snag.  I was doing yardwork the other day and it grabbed on a bag of topsoil pulling it completely off.  It is not a comfortable fit all on a human wrist.  Think wearing the form out of a watch case all day.  FAIL\n\nTaking the end cap off to upload is ok, however I like the fitbit better because three generations ago they were syncing wirelessly and automatically.  The cap also rotates around all day and I can see it eventually falling off.  Jawbone says they will replace the first cap for free and then you will have to buy them and they are not cheap! If you know you are going to have to replace them, send the extra with the package or better yet, redesign to fix the problem.  FAIL\n\nThe sleep tracker will cut itself off in the middle of the night most nights guaranteed.  I even took it off and put it on my dresser all night to see if I was hitting the button in my sleep, but it still cut off after 5 hours 12 minutes. FAIL\n\nIt only works with some android phones.  It does not work with other popular apps like myfitnesspal.  The jawbone app for tracking food is weak, very weak. Don't recreate the wheel, integrate with something that works well.  There is no computer software to use with this device.  The usb Connector is for charging only.  Come on Man! if you're going to hate on Android, don't hate on the Desktop/Laptop too!  Again a webapp that would upload the data would be great.  If my camera can upload pics wirelessly, why can't my Fitness Band? FAIL\n\nYou will never look cool wearing this with your pressed shirts, yet alone a sport coat.  Don't believe the model photos.  Not to mention, unless you have oversized cuffs, this thing is going to slide against them all day making the ride up your wrist.  I wear pressed shirts everyday and it is uncomfortable and highly noticeable. It is also thicker than it looks, think bangle rather than Livestrong bracelet, it is over a quarter of an inch thick all the way around. FAIL\n\nIt is water resistant, which is the only technology upgrade from the fitbit of three generations ago, however the new fitbit is waterproof as well, so we'll call that a draw.  I like the idea of trying to come up with a band that would perform like a fitbit but could be worn on your arm and in water, however they really should have thought it through a little more.  Besides the new fitbit is a band that can be worn in water as well.  Besides...the Fitbit is CHEAPER!!!  FAIL.\n\nIf you are on the fence about a fitness tracker after owning the Fitbit Ultra, the Fitbit One, and wearing this for a month, there is no question that any of the fitbit products are highly superior to this in function and form.  Hope this review was helpful!;FAIL, BUT NICE TRY
51;46.0;1.0;13.0;"UP by Jawbone is great in that it tracks your activity levels correctly, sleep schedule, and more. It also has an app with a great UI. If my band did not break, I would have rated it 4 stars (minus 1 star for the ""clunkiness"" of the band). However my band just stopped working after one month of mid-level activity. I have sent in a request to Jawbone support for a refund since the forums are laden with those who have had their band replaced only to experience it breaking once again, and the support requests are at such a high volume right now that they notify you it will be 2 days until you will hear back regarding your request. Bottom line, until Jawbone can fix its hardware and customer service, I would not recommend anyone to buy this product.";Great functionality but breaks after 1 month of use
59;47.0;1.0;13.0;I've had an UP band since the end of March and currently I am waiting on my 3rd, since the first 2 have crapped out on me.\n\nHere is my take on the thing....\n\nWhen I first got the band, I was ecstatic.  I thought it was going to be great and it was going to give me endless data from which to track my diet, sleep, and exercise.  It does do all of that and I think that the sleep feature is actually one of the coolest tech features I have seen.\n\nMy first UP Band lasted about 45-50 days.  I know that there is a 60 day money back guarantee, but I really didn't think much of the fact that my UP band crapped out on me after 45 days.  I figured it was just a faulty band and I dismissed, despite the fact that the first UP band had kind of gone off the deep end and forced Jawbone to offer up full refunds to everyone.  So it goes.\n\nOnce the first one crapped out, that's when things really started to go downhill.\n\nInstead of it being a simple warranty situation and me having a new band within a few days, it took almost 3 weeks for me to get my replacement band.  Upon opening the replacement band, I needed to do a hard reset because the new band was non-responsive.  I emailed customer service about this but since the hard reset seemed to fix the problem, I didn't concern myself with it.  Unfortunately, after about 2 weeks, this replacement band decided to go kaka on me.  So now I am in the process of waiting for my 3rd new UP Band in less than 75 days.\n\nTo add further context, this is against the backdrop of my wife getting an UP Band for her sister for her birthday that arrived inoperable and customer service just ignoring the problem for several weeks.  After several weeks of back and forth and unreturned calls and emails, a new band is mailed out and promptly lost in route.  Finally, after more than a month, a band finally arrives for her.\n\nAll told, not a great experience.\n\nBeing said, if the thing works...\n\nI have found the step tracker to be a really great motivator.\n\nThe sleep tracker is great and if you track your food with it, can provide some really telling insights into your sleep patterns.\n\nThe team aspect is pretty good.  You really are motivated to keep up with your teammates.\n\nI like the alarms for being sedentary.  They are super helpful.\n\nBut on the down side:\n\nI am writing this in July and I bought it in March.  I've only had the band make it through one full month.\n\nI'm not sure how effective the water protection is.  I sweat a lot.  So I think maybe this product isn't made for heavy sweaters.\n\nObviously if you are constantly dealing with customer service, there is a big issue...\n\nMy rating for now would be, be cautious.  Or buyer beware.  But I don't think Jawbone has really fixed all of the problems of the original UP Band and you might want to hold off on buying one until the next iteration.\n\n******Updated 9/15/2013*********\n\nI should mention that after about 60 days, my latest UP Band has begun acting up.  I should also mention that my wife's band has gone kaput and that my brother in law has also had to stop using his because its not working properly either.\n\nAs I have been looking around different forums on the Internet, I have become aware that this isn't an isolated instance and that it seems like the company's strategy is just to have the bands fail, replace them, and it seems like just run out the clock on the warranties. Because I haven't really seen any instance where the company has tried to take ownership of the continued problems that this device has.\n\nOn the plus side, the customer service is doing the best they can to keep customers happy...but I just think that trying to use customer service to get you out of a poorly designed and functioning product is a losing strategy.  So my original rating of 2 stars will need to be dropped to 1 star.\n\n******Updated January 4th, 2014*******\n\nI will update this again because I am now about to receive either my 6th or 7th UP band in less than 9 months. At a certain point this becomes absurd and I can't imagine that I am some sort of unique user. I would feel that after 6 or 7 bands, that there is something inherently wrong with the product.;Great When It Works (Updated 1/2014)
61;48.0;1.0;13.0;UPDATE: Jawbone replaced my broken band in August - the first band stopped working after just 4 months. Now only 2 months later, it's broken again. Can't seem to hold a charge, even after recharging it. So now I have a dead, worthless wristband. Does me no good whatsoever.\n\nJawbone clearly cannot create a product that works. First generation band was terrible, and now I've gone through two broken bands. They're also resistant to offering any sort of cash refund. They say they'll offer a replacement band (60 day warranty - just long enough to work past the warranty date). But I'm sick and tired of dealing with their customer service when I'd rather get another product that might actually work.\n\nThis has been the most frustrating time I've had with a product for a long time. Beware the UP Band. I can't see any reason to buy this thing.\n\n***\n\nDo not buy the UP Band. I purchased this four months ago in March and, all of a sudden, it stopped working two nights ago. Tried to reset it based on instructions I found online, but no luck.\n\nThe company that created the UP Band, Jawbone, has had a bad track record so far with this product. Just search for any information about their first-generation version of the UP Band. It had so many issues that they gave full refunds to anyone who bought it. The fact that mine broke after less than four months makes me think that they still have a lot to figure out about creating a product that works. I get it that electronics can break - but $130 for a product that breaks after four months? Shameful and unacceptable.\n\nDo not buy this product. It lasts long enough to get past their refund deadline (I heard the company itself, not Amazon, has a 60-day refund policy). But when it stops working, you're stuck with a terrible product. They will offer replacements, but would you want to deal with this run-around and then get another band that might just break again in another few months? You buy this product at the risk of throwing away your hard-earned money.;UP Band does not work after 4 months
39;49.0;1.0;12.0;I have a Big Jambox by Jawbone and my daughter has the smaller Jambox.  These are great products that I have highly recommended.\n\nI have been wanting to get an UP band but saw all the negative reviews.  But hey, I love my Jamboxes, and can you really trust so many negative reviews?\n\nIn this case, trust them.  Don't waste your time on the UP.  This product suffers from HUGE quality control problems.\n\nMine arrived, plugged it into the phone, nothing.  It says to charge it. Charged it overnight.  Plugged it into the phone again, nothing.  Oh, lots of red suns, meaningless flashing lights.  Checked the support pages on the web and followed directions for soft resets, blah, blah, blah.  Recharged overnight again.  Plugged it into the phone.  Nothing but more meaningless red lights.  Checked the forums.  Lots of other users complaining about red suns ... no answers to any of them from Jawbone.  Entered a support ticket.  Large volume of help requests means no response for two days.\n\nI should have known better for buying this thing based on the reviews, but I really like my other Jawbone products and thought that it was a problem with 'those other people.'\n\nBuyer beware.\n\nI'm in the process of returning for refund.  Shame on you Jawbone. Is this really how you want to treat your loyal customers?  If the thing is crap, take it off the market until you can get it sorted out.

25;52.0;1.0;10.0;First, the device is really cool. I enjoy having it to track my daily activities as a way to maintain a healthy lifestyle. It is very light and I barely notice it when I wear it. The mode changing (sleep to awake) is simple and straightforward. The Android App works great.\n\nSecond, the device's reliability is horrible. I bought mine in the summer of 2013, and it went totally dead in a little over two months. Since it was still under warranty, after contacting Jawbone's support team, I received a replacement band in about 10 days and sent the failed band back. The replacement came with a little note saying the initial warranty would no longer be valid. Sure enough, the replacement band went dead in another 5 months or so. So two failed bands in 8 months, this is a disaster for a sports-related electronic device.\n\nWhat's more, I really enjoyed my band when I first bought it, so I bought another new one and gave it to a friend as a gift. That band went dead in 3 months! So overall, 3 failed bands in about 11-month time frame. Unless you really think a 3-month period is worth you $130, stay away from this product.\n\nFailed modes vary, when my first device failed, it didn't respond to anything. My second device, the red light blinks if you push the button, but neither soft reset or hard reset fixes the issue. It doesn't sync with the app and it doesn't allow you to switch mode -- basically useless.;A cool device with horrible reliability
49;53.0;1.0;11.0;I am a cardiologist and purchased this as a possible suggestion for my patients. The concept of blending increased activity with a tool to measure is a great idea. Most people exaggerate their activities and underestimate their caloric intake.. I put the band on the 14th of August and it stopped on the 21st.. The band was charging and despite multiple resets as described it failed. I did not expose it to any water. The idea was to wear and forget , not wear and reboot. I like the app, band and idea. I have not heard back from customer service. I hope they can fix the product. If it would work, or they will replace until the bugs are worked out, I will suggest it to my patients. As of now, it is off my wrist.;UP great Idea- but does no work yet
98;54.0;1.0;12.0;I liked the up over fitbit and nike bands due to its stylish looks.  I liked the app for food snapping as well, but it needs integration with the bigger calorie tracking apps.  Overall I thought the band was well designed, but poor construction.\n\nThis is the 2nd gen of the UP band but it has all the SAME problems as the 1st gen, basically after a few weeks or month of wear and tear, it just stops working.  One day when I was charging it, I noticed it went down from 50% to 25%. What gives? Theres either a hardware or software fault that discharges the device when plugged in. After that it simply did not charge 90% of the time, it would actually discharge at an accelerated pace while plugged in. That is truly puzzling.\n\nI cant recommend the Up Band because it simply will not last.  The design kind of asks for it to break since its basically internally, a product that seems to break due to bending, but in reality it was not designed to withstand bending.\n\nI look forward to the Apple iWatch as a replacement..

123;56.0;4.0;12.0;"I've had this for a little over a month -- and am loving it so far.  I had been waiting for the new UP to be offered again after last year's debacle with UP 1.0, so when it came back on the market I snatched one up right away.\n\nI had read plenty of reviews on activity trackers, so I was fully aware of UP's (1) lack of bluetooth capability and (2) inability to automatically track non-walking activities (i.e., you have to manually input those activities after using the activity time tracker).  Knowing all this, I still decided on the UP instead of the FitBit and Nike FuelBand (and others) for various reasons:\n\n(1) I didn't want to lose the device and a bracelet you can wear while showering certainly fits the bill (FitBit is something I imagine myself losing as I've lost pedometers in the past).\n(2) I wanted something unobtrusive  (the Nike FuelBand, BodyMedia and others each look very obviously like an electronic device / don't blend well with professional office attire), and\n(3) I wanted a device with an ""idle"" alert feature that would buzz me if I've been inactive for too long.  UP fulfilled these parameters the best of all the ones I'd seen/read about.\n\nThings I love about the UP:\n\n1.  Ease of tracking walking related activities.  -- Just put it on and that's it.\n\n2.  Ease of tracking sleep.  -- For ease (and as habit now), I press the silver button at the end of the bracelet as soon as I turn off the lights to go to bed.  Then when the Smart Alarm wakes me up (see below), I press the button again to turn the alarm off.  My habit now is to synch the bracelet with my iPhone before I get in the shower in the morning just so I can see how much deep sleep and light sleep I got.  (I am fully aware that the sleep tracking is not perfect (and can't possibly be with something that doesn't track body temp and brain activity), but it gives a fair representation for most (not all) people's sleep patterns.  So far my level of restfulness in the morning seem to correlate with the amount of sleep the UP says I get.\n\n3.  Not waking up my significant other when I get up early in the morning with the Smart Alaram.  -- I often have to wake up around 5-5:30 in the morning when I have early morning work calls with Europe, so in the past had woken up my significant other with my regular (iPhone) alarm.  Since getting the UP, the gentle buzzing of the bracelet has reliably woken me up every morning while allowing my husband to continue sleeping.  This was a really nice feature that both he and I appreciated.\n\n4.  The reminders to get up and walk around the office during the day.  -- I have a bad back that is not getting any better.  As much as I stretch in the morning and at night, the inactivity during my day just wrecks my body.  Now, I get a gentle buzz whenever I've been inactive / sitting continuously at my desk for 45 minutes.  This gives me a reminder (which I've been following) to get up and walk around -- whether that's to walk to the upstairs break room to get water or take a walk around the building to stretch my legs and clear my mind.  This has truly improved the quality of my day and has helped my back quite a bit.\n\n4.  Nice looking bracelet.  -- It's quite attractive (IMO) and together with my watch and wedding ring, they are the only pieces of jewelry that I wear consistently.\n\n5.  Length of battery life.  -- I very much appreciate that the UP only needs charging every week or so.  I've not had any problems with losing the charger (as some have feared) because I keep the charger in my car's center console and charge the UP using a car USB charger.  This is perfect because there is no activity to track during my commute time anyway.  As someone who has a tendency to easily lose stuff, having the charger exactly where I need it to be (with the cap sitting in the cup holder while the UP charges) works really well .  (The one time I forgot to put the bracelet back on after charging it in my car, I just went back to my car and found everything exactly where I left them.  (By the way, this was all facilitated by my missing that ""idle"" alert buzzing that I had gotten used to sensing 2-4x per day.))\n\nThings I am okay with for now but could use improvement in future versions:\n\n1.  Manual synching.  -- I think the bluetooth capability is coming, whether that's version UP 3.0 or later.  So far though, the lack of BT is not a real big deal to me.  This is because the synching is quite fast -- probably only 10 seconds max.  To make sure I don't lose the cap, I NEVER synch and walk away.  I always take the cap off, plug in the bracelet to my iPhone and wait the 10 seconds or less to get the synching out of the way, and then put the cap and bracelet back on.  Second, so far I only really feel the need to synch 3x/day.  First thing in the morning before I get in the shower, mid-day when I am sitting at my desk anyway, and finally, at the end of the day when I set the alarm.  (Even though you can set the alarm to be the same every day or every week day, I have some morning calls that are earlier than others so I often have to check my alarm time every night anyway.)  But all that said, it would be nice if I didn't have to plug in the bracelet every time to find out how I am doing.\n\n2.  Food tracker. -- I didn't get this thing as a dietary tracker, but the feature is pretty neat.  I had used Tap & Track in the past as my app for tracking food intake, so I've only half-heartedly used this feature because I know dietary tracking is not really my thing.  I like that there are a number of ways to input your food into the UP:  Scan the barcode, Type the food or Snap a picture.  What I like about this over Tap & Track is the scan the barcode feature which really does work.  (I did encounter one item that scanned as something else, but other than that everything else has been spot on.)  I also like the stock pictures, that you can use as those make your ""food diary"" much nicer to look at/review.  The search for your food feature works okay, but could be improved as follows:  (1) be more intuitive as far as saving things to your personal library (as it seems to save EVERYTHING I eat) to My Library and (2) have a larger library (Tap & Track has more restaurants and fuller menus of those restaurants.  I'm sure this will continue to improve.  Finally, the snap a picture is a neat way to input when you go to a non-chain restaurant or cook something yourself.  Even if I don't enter the calories/nutritional info (which you can by using the type your food feature), the snap a picture mode is great because no matter what, the picture forces you to create a visual record of what you ate.  One area of improvement would be to have a website for the entire app, so you can track better your daily consumption.  Another area of improvement (and where Tap & Track has it over the UP app) is that you don't have a choice as far as how much of the serving you consumed.  It's almost always a cup or tablespoon or a serving (whatever that means) -- which isn't always the right measurement for many things consumed.\n\n3.  Smart Alarm -- Don't get me wrong.  I like the fact that the Smart Alarm knows exactly when to wake you -- during your lightest sleep phase that is closest to your preferred time (up to 1/2 hour earlier) -- so that you end up waking up feeling refreshed instead of groggy.  It really is a very easy transition to waking up when you are already in a light sleep phase.  However, I would like the option of being woken up EXACTLY when I want to be woken up -- for those nights when I am counting every second of sleep.\n\nOverall I'm very satisfied with this purchase.  It helps me move around more during the work day and motivates me to be more active when I am away from work.  The food tracking feature is also forcing me to keep a food diary (even if it's not super detailed on calories consumed).  But it does remind me every day of just what I had consumed the night before or the day before, so I am more mindful about my current day choices and portions consumed.";Loving it after a month -- but I knew what I was buying beforehand
42;57.0;1.0;10.0;"Update - November 2013 - I am on my FIFTH (yes, the original band + 4 replacements) jawbone up 2.0.\n\nI have requested a refund 3 times and it has been declined, then they ship me a replacement bracelet under their 12 month warranty. I can't believe I am on UP number 5, the longest one has lasted has been just under 2 months, and I have pre ordered the fitbit flex at this point. This product is defective, but I like the IDEA of it, and enjoy it when it works.  I cannot rely on the alarm feature though, because the bracelets consistently break.\n\n-----------\n\nI purchased a jawbone up in June and it's awesome when it works - I LOVE the sleep alarm - waking up with the bracelet buzzing instead of an alarm clock is amazing. The pedometer is useful and the app is nice; it looks beautiful and the dashboards and graphs are great.\n\nThe bracelet breaks every month to 1.5 months. Jawbone has shipped me two replacements and both of them have stopped working after 30-45 days. They are very pleasant to deal with via email support but having to replace my band this often is annoying, and I often (twice!) have to go days to weeks without it and I have to pay to ship it back to them.\n\nSomething is inherently defective about the design of this product. I started babying the band to the point of taking it off when I washed my hands and the most recent replacement still broke.  When it breaks it just stops working, sometimes at night (don't depend on that sweet alarm) or right after syncing it.\n\nI don't really even want another one, I just want my money back.  They should just ship me 10 more so I have one to use per month until the warranty expires and I switch to something else.\n\nI wish this would stop breaking, I am generally happy with the data produced but the durability is unacceptable.\n\nDo not buy the jawbone UP.";Breaks every 1.5 months and they mail you a new one
75;58.0;1.0;11.0;I bought my UP band directly from the manufacturer and within 30 days it quit providing the notifications (vibrations) to ensure you are getting up and moving.  I have had issues  with TechSupport and getting a response - even with a warranty.  Friends I know that have this have experienced the same saying they quit working if the battery runs a bit low even with re-charging as well as the issues I am experiencing now.\n\nDO NOT BUY this product - you are just wasting your money.\n\nI'm really bummed because I loved it when it was working.  Sticking with my Garmin and MyFitness Pal.\n\n[...];DO NOT Purchase - Stops working after 30 days or so
85;59.0;3.0;11.0;"I loved the Jawbone for as long as it was working. I had this bracelet for 2 weeks and i had to return it.. I was reading the review for weeks before finally purchasing it. I knew there were some good reviews and some bad, but i went ahead and bought it anyway thinking I'd be one of the lucky ones who would happily own it for a long time.\n\n It was fantastic the first week I got it. I had no problems in the beginning, simple app download, syncing, charging, profile set up, things seemed to be moving smoothly.\n\nThe sleep tracker and vibrating alarms were great. Those were my favorite features of the product. It was pretty amazing that it knew when i was awake and when i had fallen asleep.. i even tried to ""trick"" it.. i switched it to sleep mode and layed in bed and watched tv, almost motionless then moved slightly to turn off the tv and it noted that i fell asleep in 35 minutes. I do toss and turn in the middle of the night but it didn't register as me waking up, it did register that i woke up when i actually woke up.\n\nThe step tracker was close to accurate. I calibrated the step tracker and it does help with accuracy. I even counted the steps i took and matched it to what the jawbone thought i took and it was off by about 15-20 steps (not too bad but if you wave your arm around, they count it as steps)\n\nThe app itself is very nice, but i did not like using the food tracker, it there was some way for the jawbone to sync to myfitnesspal i think it would be more useful. I don't feel that the food tracker is fully developed yet and was a pain to use, the camera scanner didn't work, there weren't that many options, it took forever to find mountain dew in a 20 fl oz bottle and the calories didn't match.\n\nThe battery life claims it will hold for 10 days, i had to recharge mine after 5. Granted they suggest that you sync your band no more than twice a day, i did it maybe 3-4 for the first few days.\n\nBy the end of the second week, i went to charge it (only the 3rd time charging) it would not charge. I left it over night and it remained low battery. I soft reset it, hard reset it, used different usb ports, used a wall charger, deleted the app and restarted from the scratch and no luck. I don't know what happened there and it seems there have been several complaints about it spontaneoulsy dying... Jawbone needs to perhaps take yet another look at this..\n\nSince it won't charge and it's only been the second week, i am returning it back to amazon for a refund since it seems to be a known problem and unable to charge the product, it's of no use to anyone:(\n\nI still think this item was fantastic while it worked, i have no idea why it stopped working, if the charging problem never happened, i would definitely recommend it.. as of right NOW, i can't say that I would.";I did love it, till it died
44;60.0;5.0;10.0;"I bought my Jawbone Up on 2/18/2013 from Amazon. It failed after 5 months. Jawbone Support was very helpful and sent me an updated (larger) new UP 7/18/13. The replacement, likely a refurbished version, failed 9/8/13. Support sent an ungodly number of troubleshooting questions and things for me to do each time; including wiping all my data, uninstalling/reinstalling software, pressing buttons in specific sequences, ....and literally 14 steps each email. Update, Jawbone is replacing the 2nd broken Up. That is suprisingly good service.\n\nI am addicted to the data stream, continuous monitoring, ability to keep focus and consciousness on healthier living. The software is terrific. I lost 25 pounds during this time I've had the Jawbone without it feeling at all difficult. (And I didn't do any changes on purpose for the first month I had it)\n\nBeing an early adopter of technology often means things don't work exactly perfectly.\nI understand financially Jawbone can't stay in business replacing each UP band multiple times. I am not happy it failed so quickly nor the ridiculous number of troubleshooting steps required.\n\nJawbone still has some durability issues to resolve  but the UP is a terrific when it works and you should buy one. The software is that much better than the competing products. The data is that helpful. The customer support is wonderful too.";Great customer support, addictive product
47;61.0;1.0;9.0;"The UP band by Jawbone is a great idea. I got a 1st generation band in December, 2011 and went through 3 of them, none lasting longer than 30 days before giving up and asking Jawbone for a refund. At least at that point, Jawbone acknowledged the obvious, that the product was defective, and refunded my money.\n\nBecause I really liked the product, I bought a 2nd generation in December, 2012.  The product is great when it works. Unfortunately, it is every bit as defective as the 1st generation.  My first 2nd generation band lasted from December 26, 2012 until May 19, 2013 before it died-refusing to sync, reset or hold a charge.  That was nearly 5 times longer than any of the 1st generation bands lasted so I thought perhaps I was just unlucky with that band.  Jawbone sent me a replacement band. It arrived on May 24, 2013.  By July 7, it too was dead.  At that point, I was done. I asked Jawbone to refund my purchase price of $130.00.  I then learned that the 1 year ""warranty"" doesn't really mean that they warrant the product for 1 year.  They really warrant the product for only 60 days. If it fails after 60 days, they will give you another band, but not a refund. Great, I get another defective product. So I gave it a try, starting with 2nd generation UP band #3 on July 21, 2013. It died on September 1, 2013, lasting a total of 41 days. Same issues, won't charge, won't sync, won't reset. Most frustrating-Jawbone won't acknowledge that there is anything wrong with this product, even in the face of overwhelming evidence that these are not isolated product failures.\n\nMy experience is not unique. Before you buy this product, look at the product support boards on Jawbone's own website. They are littered with similar stories.  If you have money to burn and don't mind burning $130 for a 45 day experience, by all means buy an UP band. But if you expect something more for your money, turn and run in the other direction.";Abysmal failure of quality control
103;62.0;1.0;10.0;I owned the first version of this product that used to fail constantly. I had to get 3 replacements of it till I finally gave up. I purchased to new one thinking it may be better. I was wrong! It works only half the time... The step walking portion usually works but when you put it night mode to track your sleep it sometimes doesn't track it even if it has battery left in it. Such a horrible product from a big company and an over priced price tag. I won't be purchasing from Aliph anymore.;Works Half the Time

56;64.0;5.0;9.0;This is probably one of the most controversial product review discussions I have ever seen on Amazon. I don't normally leave reviews but since I bought the product and have used it for over two months, I thought it might be helpful to others to cast my vote.\n\nI was extremely skeptical about buying it due to the large number of negative reviews and feedback but wanted something that could track my relative activity, monitor sleeping hours and provide motivation to get out and move more. I was a college athlete but my goal at 47 is to make a few small, unintrusive lifestyle changes that might improve my general well-being.\n\nI have had the product for over 2 months and have not had a single problem - fingers crossed. It has worked as advertised and I cannot imagine going without it. I am unable to provide comparative reviews to Nike Plus or Fitbit but I bought this because I wanted to wear something 24/7 and it seemed like the best form factor with that in mind.\n\nIt looks fine in business attire, a suit or any formal occasion if you insist on wearing it. Another feature I like is that the alarm is totally silent but will wake you up. It's a very subtle vibration on your wrist which effectively will wake you up everytime. I am a heavy sleeper so was a little surprised at how effective it is. If you have a new born baby or just need to wake up like a ninja, this might appeal to you.\n\nIt gets my vote. If you're on the fence, I would take a chance. If it doesn't work out, just return and move on to another brand. Good luck!;So far so good
4;65.0;5.0;10.0;I have had this a week and like it.  I m not bothered by having to manually sync it though I see lots of posters are.  Initially I found food entry cumbersome but after a week in my daily foods are now in my library so recording is  quick (I just click on a picture of the food and it records calories, fat, protein, etc.)..  The barcode scanning allows recording new food in just a couple clicks..  Snapping a picture for each food is optional but kind of fun (for the obsessive in me).  I wonder about he accuracy of the sleep monitor.  I found I am seriously sleep deprived and that is a big deal so getting on top of that alone helps me jutify the $129.  I expect these will become very popular as others enter the market maybe the price will come down.  My band has become looser in just one week so I am glad I bought a small (I was in-between sizes).  The black doesn't stand out and looks like a watch band (that's good).;scanning feature
6;66.0;3.0;10.0;I love the FuelBand, but, as Thor remarks, what is a 'fuel point' anywho? I got my UpBand yesterday in order to compare these two activity innovatipns and second Thor's apprehensions: Why no Bluetooth syncing? And How much will it cost me to replace how many lost sync jack caps? (AT&T wants $9 apiece)\nI add that, without glasses, I cannot tell the difference between a 'sun' and a 'moon' notification so it's hard for me to see whether or not I'm in 'sleep mode' before checking out at night.\nThat being said, the information collected by this minimalist wristband is phenomenal. Of course we have to keep an open mind on what the band records and how accurate the data is, but the iPhone app presents an awesome display of activity and sleep data that definitely motivates me to improve my mindfulness around these subjects.\nI got the FuelBand to increase my daily activity and its been a great success for me and my family. I got the UpBand to see if more information and sleep awareness could improve on this success. So far I'm on the fence with the UpBand: don't like the sync jack interface with my iphone, but impressed with depth of information recorded, even if it is a lot more complicated.  At least when you snooze you don't loose.;More information and complicated
62;67.0;4.0;9.0;After reading numerous reviews about the Jawbone -Up and similar devices from other manufacturers I decided to to give the Up a try as its features seemed to be the best fit for my needs.  I will admit that I have found the device very easy to use.  I don't mind that you have to to manually sync the item.  The app interface is clear, and its easy to change or adjust settings.  If you want to track meals its easy to do so.  All of that said, my unit seems to be suffering from that fatal flaw that others have reported - after a month or so the unit will no longer sync - which makes this a $129 bracelet rather than a functional monitoring device.  Amazon's return policy on this device in only 30 days..... mine stopped working at 35 days so now I can not get a refund or even exchange it for another unit to try again without out of pocket expense to me.  So I am giving this product 3 stars - and hoping that Amazon will volunteer to help me out here!  Before it quit syncing - I would have given it 4.5 stars.\n\nUPDATE:  As other Amazon reviewers suggested I emails customer support at Jawbone THIS MORNING - I have already heard back from them.  They provided the following instructions to try and fix my problem.  It worked - I am UP and RUNNING again.  I am posting this suggested fix from the manufacturer so if others are using APPLE devices with their UP - they can perhaps solve the issue themselves.  In this case it would appear the problem was the APP not the device.  I increased my rating to 4 stars (would give 4.5 if that was possible) - for great customer support.  Good luck.\n\nFrom Jawbone UP Customer Support: This is Erin with Jawbone Customer Care, thanks for getting in touch on this. I'm sorry your band is refusing to sync - I know it's frustrating when you can't get to your data! Let's try some quick troubleshooting steps to get your UP running again.\n\nDifferent aspects of an iOS device may impact your ability to sync, and I'd like to confirm this isn't the case here. Please start with these steps:\n\n1. Restart the iOS device (just power it off, and then back on)\n\n2. Quit out of all open apps, including UP:\n- Double click your Home button (the main menu button) to bring open the tray of all running apps.\n- Press and hold on any app icon until red minus signs appear.\n- Tap each red minus button to close each app.\n\n3. Make sure the volume on your device is all the way up using the side volume controls, and double check that you have a strong internet connection - it's important that you search for something in your browser and make sure you can get a result.\n\n4. Make sure your headphone jack is functioning and that any case you may use on your device isn't interfering with the connection.\n\n5. Re-launch UP and wait for the app to open fully. Once on the Home screen, plug your band in. The sync will start automatically. If it doesn't, press the Sync Now button on the right menu screen.\n\nIf you're still having trouble syncing, we can try uninstalling and reinstalling the UP app. (This won't erase any data! - THE BAND WILL TELL YOU THE DATA WILL BE ERASED BUT IT REALLY WILL STILL BE THERE) To uninstall, tap and hold on any app icon until the apps start wiggling. Then, tap the X button that appears on your UP app. To reinstall, head back to the app store, search for UP by Jawbone, and download.\n\nAfter you've reinstalled UP on your device, you'll sign in using the email associated with your UP account. Once you're on the home screen of the app, plug your band in to sync again. The sync will start automatically - if it doesn't, use the manual Sync Now button.\n\nYou can also try to sync your band on a friend's device - just make sure you log in using your own UP account first! This will help us better isolate the issue, and confirm if the band can no longer sync, or if there's a factor on the secondary device contributing to the difficulties.\n\nFinally, please also try a soft reset of your UP band using the instructions here: www.jawbone.com/kb/articles/425.html\n\nIf none of the above troubleshooting tricks help, please reply here with your shipping address, phone number, and also your bands serial number- i'd be happy to look into processing a warranty exchange for you. Please also provide the following information:\n\n1. How your band performs during a voice memo test, by following these steps:\n- Open the voice memo app on your phone\n- Plug your band into the headphone jack of your device\n- Note what number the dial jumps to\n2. How the band's status light responds when you plug in to sync - the Sun status light should flash when the band is plugged in.;Worked great for 35 days but then.... UPDATE
90;68.0;1.0;9.0;I had my bracelet for less than three months. Went to charge it this morning and nothing. Upon plugging in it cycles through a bunch of colors, then stays on flashing red for the remainder of plug in time. No matter how long I charged it, once I disconnect...nothing.  No charge, no response in the bracelet, and the app will not detect or sync with the band.\n\nI guess when, and if, Jawbone Customer Service responds to my query for help will determine whether or not I've been ripped off $130.00.\n\nUPDATE (11June13):\nIt took a hot minute for CS to respond to my queries and I did get a replacement UP band but it took a long time because for some reason the company wouldn't mail the replacement directly to my location.  I understand that some companies won't mail to FPO/APO addresses, since they are overseas, but that wasn't an issue in my case.  I'm on a stateside military base with an ordinary mailing address.  But, whatever, I finally get the replacement band and everything was working again...for another two months.  After that?  Yep, you guessed it.  THE SAME DAMN THING HAPPENED TO MY REPLACEMENT!!! W.T.F?!\n\nIt's not like I'm doing any extreme activities, submersing myself in large and deep bodies of water, or anything else that would be taxing to this freaking product. I am done with this.  It's obviously a piece of unreliable, over priced piece of plastic with a headphone jack.\n\nDo not waste your money on this product AND if this is the standard for devices...avoid anything else with the Jawbone label.;Yet another defective bracelet...
38;69.0;4.0;8.0;This is a great product. The app is brilliantly designed, the band is simple to use, pretty elegant and in 6 weeks of using it, I've lost two  kilograms. I just ordered one for my wife for christmas on amazon and have been raving about them to friends. Then today, mine just died. Tried the hard reset, soft reset etc. I have been careful with it, always take it off before having a shower etc. Wasnt doing anything unusual when it just quit on me.\n\n Now reading the forums it looks like mine has succumbed to the same problems as everyone elses - the six week fail. Unfortunately mine was a gift, so no receipt. This idea is so good, that I am going to buy another one, despite the problem. I've really got into the habit of tracking and monitoring and the software design of the app is intuitive, slick and informative. The sleep monitoring is uncanny in its accuracy, the exercise app integrates with runkeeper which I use all the time and the calorie counter is easy to use and has a really nifty way of displaying the results so you get an idea of what you are over indulging in and whether you are getting enough of the right things (fibre etc) and avoiding the bad things (salt, cholesterol sugar etc.)It also has a bar code reader which worked flawlessly to quickly enter foods in the six weeks I have used it.\n\n When they get the quality sorted, this is a killer device. It really gets you thinking about exercising, sleeping and eating and importantly it encouraged me to modify my behaviour. It reminds you to get up if you've been idle, and the food tracking meant I started avoiding some foods when I realised they were really contributing calories and not much else. If the sleep monitoring showed I hadnt got enough sleep, I went to sleep earlier. I've tried other health monitoring devices, but this has the advantage of being constantly on and fits into your life simply. I found that having to sync it rather than it syncing itself was an advantage as it got me to look at activity and sleep and think about what I was doing. The concept worked so well, what a shame the hardware failed. The quality on the jawbone headsets I've bought over the years has been great - I tend to lose them long before they show any sign of quitting so clearly the company will get this right eventually. I am still a fan despite the problems. I really hope Jawbone gets this right. I'm giving it another go.\n\nUpdate: Jawbone contacted me AND SENT ME A NEW ONE FREE OF CHARGE . Outstanding customer service. Will update on how this one goes.;Great customer service

19;71.0;1.0;7.0;I bought this band through Amazon and I loved it!  But after a few months it stopped syncing with my phone so I called Jawbone and they sent quickly sent a replacement.  Again after a few months, the second band refused to sync and they replaced it quickly and cheerfully.  After a few months my 3rd band wouldn't sync or hold a charge, so they cheerfully replaced it.  A month ago this one stopped syncing or holding a charge, so they replaced it with a 4th band.  This would not hold a charge at all, so they replaced it with a 5th band.  The new band was warped and wouldn't hold a charge or sync when I got it, so they cheerfully replaced it.  Monday I got the 6th band and it was made with the ends atop each other, rather than side by side.  They were less cheerfull today when I called them and they asked for photos proving that I wasn't making this up.  I am waiting for band number 7 and have little confidence that it will work.  At this point I am furious and want my money back.;Frustrating Experience
10;72.0;1.0;5.0;Here's the thing:\n\nI love my Jawbone, and I gave serious thought to precisely how many stars I should give it in my review. I was toying with two but ended up settling on one.\n\nThe product itself is great. It tracks my movement, workouts (even on a treadmill), and sleep very accurately. The app is pretty good and I can usually find the food with the matching nutritional information which makes counting calories really easy.\n\nThere is, however, one problem with the product - and it's a biggie. I can't really use it any more. At the time of writing this review I've had it just under two months. Over the past two weeks, the band has been syncing less and less reliably. First, it would sync just fine. Then, it would take a couple of attempts to sync. Now, it's taking me literally ten to fifteen tries to sync. I've beaten myself up about it a little because I saw reviews for the product on here saying the exact same thing and I chose to ignore them. Oh, how I wish I'd heeded the warning(s).\n\n(No, I've never worn the band in the shower and/or submerged it in water)\n\nTo be fair, the customer service at Jawbone is good. I spoke to Kathryn in their call center on New Year's Eve and we had a pleasant chat about Doctor Who. She promised to take care of this for me. We did the scripted run through of resetting the band, uninstalling and reinstalling the app. None of it worked. I asked if it would be possible to pay a little extra money and upgrade my band to the UP24 as this would eliminate my syncing problems. However I've been told that my only option is to send my band off to have it replaced. No upgrades, to refunds, no nothing. So I guess I'll have my band replaced but at this point I've got a horrible taste left in my mouth from a product that promises so much but goes bad way too quickly.;Great for a few weeks. Then it stopped working.
11;73.0;3.0;5.0;BLUF.  Should you buy the Jawbone Up Fitness Tracker? Yes, if you're ok with having to manually synch with your phone or computer (no Bluetooth) and trying to save a few dollars.  For the price it is a great buy and Jawbone makes some of the best fitness trackers on the market.\n\nhttps://help.jawbone.com/up (note: Jawbone is no longer selling the Up, but still provides support via their website)\n\nKey features compared to the Jawbone Up24 include:\n1) A longer battery life  10 Days for the Up vs. 7 days for the Up24\n2) Connects to your phone via the headphone (3.5mm) jack. Up24 has a 2.5mm plug and can not connect to your phone.\n3) Price.  It is cheaper than the Up24 and you can even get a like new model of the Up from Amazon Warehouse Deals for around $50.\n\nKey feature/benefit compared to the Fitbit Flex is the phone application.  I prefer the Jawbone Up app over the Fitbit app.  My wife has the Fitbit flex and when comparing the two apps the Up had more detail and offers a lot more info, while not being too overwhelming.  The Up app simply offers a better user experience.\n\nThe key criticism of the Up is the lack of Bluetooth.  Which is why I returned this model and instead went with the Up24.  Wirelessly synching the fitness tracker makes using the device just a little simpler.  Was worth the extra money to have an Up24.\n\nUp and Up24 aren't waterproof.  Cant wear them in the pool or in the bath.  Though you can wear it in the shower, which I prefer not to do because I find it annoying on my wrist while bathing.  I also think keeping the soap/water off of it will keep it from fading or getting a chalky appearance.  Just rinse it off with water and dry it with a towel to keep it clean.\n\nAnother criticism I have is the Jawbone customer service.  Dealt with them several times regarding issues with my Up24 and they are like talking to a robot.  Every response from them is always, did you try a soft reset.  Ugh..., if you can be patient, they will eventually help you, but they have a ways to go with regard to offering a positive experience to the customer.\n\nAs of Jan 15 the Up current has 3 out of 5 stars on Amazon reviews.  I concur with this rating, but only because it doesnt have Bluetooth and with newer models coming out, specifically referring to the Up3 by Jawbone, the Up is getting old.\n\nMany of the Amazon criticisms address the durability and connectivity issues with the Jawbone Up.  If you treat the Up well it will last, but like any new technology, the Up can be finicky and sometimes give you problems.  One benefit of not having Bluetooth is the Ups connection to your phone is more likely to work and not face the same issues that impact wireless technology.  As for me, Ive dealt with some of the functionality problems wearing the Up24 (see my review of the Up24 for details - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LXV7WLIC5V65/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm).  But for only $50 and if price is the driving factor, I think the Jawbone Up is the best fitness tracker on the market.\n\nRecommend anyone in the market for a fitness tracker read the reviews on DC Rainmakers website.  Absolutely the most detailed and informative fitness tech reviews anywhere on the internet.\n\nAlso recommend reviews on Amazon by RST.  Very thorough and well written.  http://www.amazon.com/review/RT0KPKVSQD0HI/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#RT0KPKVSQD0HI\n\nCONCLUSION.  Should you by the Jawbone Up?  Yes if you want to spend the least amount of money and have a solid fitness tracker that provides accurate feedback.  If you can wait and have the money, I recommend the Jawbone Up3 coming out in Feb or Mar 15.  Or if you want more than just a fitness tracker (i.e. a fitness watch) and have the money to spend, wait until the Apple Watch comes out.  Im betting it will be a game changer for the fitness tracker/watch market.;Best fitness tracker for the money, but

Expect this app to snoop through your address book, calendar, and upload these to Jawbone without any indication of how they'll be used. The Jawbone privacy policy states: ""When you use the Jawbone Companion app we connect with and upload to our servers the address book and calendar on your device along with other data that we normally collect through our mobile apps..."" Sorry, but to monitor my heart rate and sleep cycle, you don't need to know who my friends are and when I have a conference call. The app also demands permission to turn on your camera or record audio through your device microphone without notice. Naturally, the packaging doesn't warn you of any of this--- they wait until you've brought it home and try to set up the wristband before letting you know they're snoops.\n\nDon't waste your money. Wait until Jawbone releases a version that requests appropriate permissions instead of allowing them to snoop through all your private data. Total bummer of a Christmas present I have to return immediately.";Invasion of Privacy
12;75.0;1.0;5.0;Quite simply put, don't buy this product. I cannot stress this enough. Jawbone Up is a great idea in concept. I loved the vibrating alarm to wake you up during a light sleep in the morning. However, the Jawbone Up fails in it's implementation, specifically in regards to battery and power.\n\nMy wife had to exchange her Up with Jawbone 4 months after we received the device. My Up lasted three months longer and was recently replaced by Jawbone. The replacement Up I was mailed failed immediately upon charging it. The replacement Up I received vibrated on and off the entire night while I tried to sleep - so much for the nice sleep function!  The replacement Up vibrated so much that one night that it was dead by the morning.\n\nI don't have the time or patience to deal with Jawbone and this faulty product anymore. When contacting their customer support, they immediately try to blame your mobile device you are trying to sync with. After back and forth with the company about 3 to 4 times, they finally believe the device is bad and mail you a replacement (which will also fail).\n\nBelieve what you read with the other one star reviews and save your money, this product will stop working within a few months of purchase. Don't waste your money on Jawbone Up.;Look elsewhere for a fitness band - buyer beware!
89;76.0;1.0;8.0;Purchased this band with high hopes and was left with disappointment.  This band was suppose to be an improvement over the previous band that was plagued with problems and customers were refunded their money.  Despite being careful with my band it lasted only 35 days at which time it stopped working and would not hold a charge.;Jawbone Down
105;77.0;2.0;8.0;Received my first UP band in December 2011. Five weeks later it quit working. I loved the product so much I waited a year for the problems to be fixed and the next generation to be re-introduced. I purchased my new UP the second week of December 2012. This one lasted seven weeks. Is that an improvement?;Love the product - just wish it would work!
54;78.0;1.0;7.0;This company has a history of problems with their product. I chose to give them a chance when they reissued the UP because my friend works for the company. Even with my friend's feelings in mind, I can only say that this product is completely defective and a fraud on the public. I have heard too many stories about this product failing to believe that it works for most users. I have had two that stopped charging in 6 months. So definitely don't waste your money on this. For the few months that it did work, it wasn't that illuminating. You have to remember to put it into sleep mode whenever you go to sleep and I don't think it's sensitive enough to really give you useful information about sleep patterns. Also it doesn't track calories accurately. If you decide to do a workout, you have to manually input the data. That seems completely contrary to how this should work. And all of those other programs you can supposedly use to hack your life (e.g. the idleness timer or power nap function) are impossible to use because you have to remember a sequence of button pushes to activate them and will never know whether you did the sequence properly since there is no display. It's crap. Save your money.;Two bands stopped working in 6 months
20;79.0;1.0;6.0;"I have owned and used the Jawbone Up for almost a year and I'm very disappointed. The idea of the band was a good one, but the execution of that idea falls flat. So many problems: (1) In order for it to record your sleep, you must push a button when you go to bed and push it again when you get up. If you forget to push the button it does not record your sleep. That is a simple fix in the design programming, but they failed to design it to detect when you go to sleep or get up. (2) Once you download the software, you cannot alter or change your entries, like if you make a mistake in typing, or simply want to start over. It matches up with your email address, so if you want to start over, you have to delete the software from your computer/phone, reset the band, and re-enter it with another email address. If you enter the same email address, the old data reappears on your log again. This is ridiculous. (3) The biggest flaw in the design is that it does NOT measure your activity accurately. Since the band is on your wrist, if you wave your arms around, it thinks you are moving. I tried an experiment. I walked briskly for 30 minutes without moving my arms. Then I did arm exercises sitting on the couch for 30 minutes. The band recorded the arm movements as exercise and did not record the walking as activity. That is a MAJOR FLAW in the band! It should base the activity on your elevated heart beat not on whether you wave your arms around or not. (4) There is no way to record data at a later date. For instance, if you fail to push the button to record your sleep, and you are busy during the day and the time rolls past midnight, you cannot enter the data for the day. Same thing with food; if you forget to log in something, at midnight, the opportunity to enter for the prior day is gone forever. If you have a busy life, this is a major drawback. (5) Finally, it is poorly made. I took very good care of my band and yet it started to fall apart 90 days after I started wearing it and by the ninth month, it had stopped charging and the cover that attached over the plug would no longer attach. It did not even make it to the one year anniversary of purchase. I would NOT recommend this band. You will not only be disappointed, but frustrated with its inadequacies.";VERY DISAPPOINTED - DO NOT RECOMMEND
22;80.0;3.0;6.0;I first purchased my band last May (2013) and was instantly in love.  Tracked my steps, allowed me to enter my daily food intake, and let me set a sleep alarm to gently vibrate within 30 minutes of my target time, based on light/deep sleep.  After a few months, for no apparent reason, it just quit.\nJawbone sent a replacement band (it took them about six weeks) and that one worked okay, but it was different (color indicator lights were red, not green, vibration was stronger, etc.)  About two months later, that one would not sync or recharge.  Jawbone sent another band (after about eight weeks) and that one was DOA - it would not sync, would not charge, did not show any activity regardless of what device it was plugged into.\nThat was January and I am STILL WAITING for a new band - it is the fourth week of March.  Jawbone has since come out with (and are promoting) a new design.  I can find the identical band to the one I want replaced at Apple, Verizon, and Best Buy, yet Jawbone says THEY DON'T HAVE IT IN STOCK.  Would I like an onyx band instead?\nI have since found an app for $1.99 that works wonderfully on my iPhone to wake me with a vibration just like the UP bracelet did.  I have since found a pedometer that works like a charm.  I have always had a calorie counter online, so I would tell anyone considering buying this bracelet: DON'T.\nI am fighting now for the principle of the thing.  For $129.00 they should make a product that works for at least the warranty period of a year.  Jawbone has used up about 3 1/2 months of the warranty just by not keeping the band in stock (really?!) to replace ones that don't work.\nSave yourself the hassle and buy a Fitbit, or the aforementioned apps.\nPam;Would not buy again
60;81.0;1.0;7.0;Good for keeping track of steps and that's about it. The app for adding food and exercise is very quirky and not very user friendly unless you are scanning a bar code.  Will be returning mine since after  2 weeks it will no longer hold a charge.  Save your money don't buy this product.;Will not charge
31;82.0;1.0;6.0;I'm on my fourth Jawbone UP in six months, and a few days in, it's already not working. The first one lasted the longest -- a couple months -- before it could no longer maintain its alarms or other settings. The second one stopped taking a charge within days. In the third one, the clock failed to keep time, losing 15 minutes in a day. The fourth one seems to be acting like the first, where it either can't remember alarms, or it won't activate them consistently.\n\nWith each broken device, I've tried soft resets, hard resets, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, and more. Once I've gone through all those steps, Jawbone support has been decent -- at least in the sense that they will quickly replace my broken UP band with another UP band, broken in a different way. (From reading the other reviews, I can see that they've gotten a lot of practice at this.)\n\nWhat they won't do is issue a refund. They have my $130, and it seems there is no way they will give that up. I'm stuck with a device that can't be trusted to keep time or ring an alarm, which ruins most of intended functionality. Since the alarm is the main feature that caused me to buy this over other options, I find this extremely frustrating.\n\nI had read about the notorious failures of the first Jawbone UP, and somehow I thought they would learn from that, and be extra careful to release a polished product. I was wrong.;Yet another dissatisfied buyer -- on my 4th band, still not working
32;83.0;2.0;6.0;I am currently on my 4th Jawbone Up band.  Each band that I've owned has died after exactly two months of daily use.  My band was not abused in any way and it has been worn exactly how the company tells you to wear it.  I believe the Up band has major design flaws, which Jawbone is starting to recognize.  I really liked it when it worked properly and the app is super easy to use.  I also give Jawbone's customer service high marks because they replaced all of my defective bands.  Since I feel the Up band has major design flaws, I would not recommend purchasing this product until Jawbone is able to resolve it.;The Up band has major design flaws...
118;84.0;1.0;7.0;"I have been wearing my UP since before Christmas (and have had to charge it just 2x during those 19 days).\n\nThe UP's performance has been flawless so far.\n\nThe band is lightweight and unobtrusive; after a couple of days, you don't even notice you are wearing it any more.\n\nI do take it off prior to showering, although it is waterproof: no one needs to monitor his/her steps in the shower or bath, and I figure that constant contact with water and soap / shampoo will eventually degrade any device's appearance. (It takes a second to remove it and second to put it back on, so I do not consider this an inconvenience.)\n\nLike most other shoppers, I considered the Fitbit One as well, but several factors weighed heavily in favor of the UP in my mind.\n\nI love that the UP is on me at all times and I don't have to fiddle with a clip or a wristband or other accessories to use it. I already have a lot of gadgets and devices that need special accessories; the last thing I want is one more. Being required to wear a large wristband to strap the Fitbit on every night was a dealbreaker for me.\n\nI also love that the UP does not require Bluetooth to sync. Many reviews complain bitterly that this is a fault or an omission; I see it as a feature.\n\nDo I really want to be tempted to obsessively check real time stats as they come in? Nope.\n\nDo I want to have to leave power-sucking Bluetooth turned on all the time on my phone ? Definitely not.\n\nIs it super simple and easy to just plug the UP into the headphone port whenever you feel like doing a sync? You bet.\n\nLess is more, in this case.\n\nGiven its small form factor and light weight, I find the UP's performance pretty remarkable.\n\nThe iOS app is intuitive, colorful, and appealing, and the ability to add teammates is a fantastic motivational feature (especially if your friends are more active than you are).\n\nI do, however, hope that Jawbone will add the ability to track your data via its www site in the future, as well as improve the ability to download/import your data into other fitness apps.\n\nUPDATE (April 2013):\n\nAfter four months of use, I continue to appreciate the UP's form factor and functionality. My original band developed a fault after a couple of months -- a strange clunking noise as if something were moving inside the band -- and Jawbone replaced it.\n\nJawbone's customer service was speedy and efficient (although it did involve an enormous avalanche of emails from different departments). I promptly received a replacement band in generic non-retail packaging, and was given a prepaid label to ship the faulty band back.\n\nThe replacement has been working fine. While disappointed to have experienced a flaw like that so early in the band's life, I am still happy with the UP and was impressed by Jawbone's support.\n\nANOTHER UPDATE (July 2013):\n\nAfter three months of use, my replacement band bit the dust.\n\nWhile washing the car, I inadvertently splashed the band lightly -- once. As soon as I noticed it had gotten a little bit of moisture on it, I took it off and put it inside the house.\n\nThree hours later, the band was completely non-functional and unresponsive. Not impressive for a product that is supposedly ok to wear in the shower or when swimming!!\n\nOnce again, Jawbone was prompt to provide a replacement, which is working well so far.\n\nHowever, my confidence in the UP is pretty much gone.\n\nIt is great that Jawbone will replace them so quickly whenever there is a problem, but owners must realize that that largesse will disappear as soon as the original warranty period expires. At that point, the repair costs will likely be prohibitive... and many disappointed owners will likely opt to ditch a faulty out-of-warranty band or jump ship to Fitbit rather than shovel out even more money into supporting this faulty design.\n\nI'm deducting two stars from my rating to reflect the abbreviated lifespan of the band. Sorry, Jawbone, I wanted to believe you had addressed your quality issues, but you haven't.\n\nANOTHER UPDATE (May 2014):\n\nAfter nine months of using the latest replacement band, my UP had lost its vibrating function, sync had become problematic (working once out of every three attempts or so), and the rubber casing on the band had started to work itself loose on the end that jacks into the iPhone.\n\nWhen I wrote Jawbone about it, they immediately offered to send a replacement and asked for my shipping address.\n\nAfter I provided it, another customer service rep wrote to revoke that offer, without explanation.\n\nMy friends with UP bands have experienced similar reliability issues. No UP band seems to last for more than 10 months, if the user is lucky.\n\nFor the record, I do not shower or swim with my band, and treat it gently.\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be purchasing another Jawbone product -- especially after the company reneged on its offer to send a replacement. Yes, after one rep said ""a replacement is on its way"", another one intervened to cancel the replacement. Ultimately, another rep reinstated the replacement after I complained, but that doesn't make me feel any better about the product or the company at this point.\n\nI am deducting another two stars from my review, leaving it with just one star, which seems generous for a $130 product that can't perform its advertised functions for more than a couple of months at a time.\n\nFINAL UPDATE (August 2015):\n\nWell, the latest replacement has failed, too, after very light and minimal use. The rubber sleeve has become detached from the unit underneath it, the band will not sync, and the status lights blink in unison. Soft and hard resets do nothing. Contacting Jawbone yields an email citing ""unusual volume"" of customer service requests, but promises someone will get back to me ""in 2-3 days."" Seems like I am not the only one dealing with their products' substandard design and construction.\n\nI would revise this to a zero-star review, were that possible. Do yourself a favor and avoid Jawbone fitness trackers.";UPDATED REVIEW: Utterly unreliable and abysmal product
15;85.0;1.0;5.0;"First off, I'll recommend you just google ""jawbone up defective"" and see comments from others besides me.\n\nBack to my review...While it worked great for a while, it is a conveniently flawed product and their customer service is not truly interested in making their customers happy.  Jawbone ""got lucky"" as mine completely failed within two weeks of the warranty expiring.  They sent me through their usual hoops of soft resetting, etc.  I was optimistic that it was something minor.  But no, the thing was just dead.  And because it was out of warranty, they gave me the boot.  Wow...really, Jawbone?  After all those 'Have a great day' customer service emails, you kicked me to the curb because the warranty was just two weeks expired.  It's not like I damaged the product or I was contacting you months after the warranty expired.  Two weeks and I have had multiple people at the company refuse to do 'the right thing'.  I believe they feel that it was a financially sound decision to deny one replacement wristband rather than lose business from all the people who read the resultant negative reviews.";Conveniently flawed -- Don't buy it
16;86.0;1.0;5.0;"I purchased my UP band in November of 2012 and it stopped holding a charge 3/2013. After various correspondence and trouble-shooting attempts, Jawbone was kind enough to replace this band with a new band. My second band stopped working 6/2013 and again, trouble-shooting and they agreed to replace the 2nd defective band. The 3rd replacement band quit working in 9/2013 and I was sent the only size they had available at the time (not my size) and I nursed the fourth and final band along until 4/2014. With this fourth band, I was very careful. I didn't wear it in the shower or to a vigorous workout. My reward for nursing this 4th band along,was that it quit after my one year warranty was up. I contacted Jawbone and they tried trouble-shooting with me again, and once determined that this fourth band was kaput, declined to replace it due to the one year warranty being ""UP"" (pun intended).\nSo, first - I commend Jawbone for replacing their 3 defective bands that expired during the warranty period. That gave me hope that I'd eventually receive a good one. That was not to be.\nIf I had returned the first faulty band to the apple store and received my money back, I'd be much better off. Unfortunately I kept hoping that the bands I received were just flukes. They were not.\nSo, my fourth and final UP band quits and Jawbone says sorry, you're out of warranty now but we'll gladly give you a 15% discount on your next purchase of an UP band. Seriously? You're going to give me a discounted defective product? Oh JOY! You must really think I'm a sucker. You can't give me ONE band that will last the length of your warranty and you would like me to give you more of my business? Each time your rep tells me that this is a unique experience, but I'm not the only person I know who's UP band has died in a matter of a couple of months.\nI should also add that I was so in love with my UP band that I recommended it to family and friends, and to them I'd like to apologize. My husband's second band quit last month and he is feeling so burnt by Jawbone that he's investigating if he can return it and get his money back.\nSo, to all of you considering an UP band, give it a go but when it stops working, don't work with Jawbone, get your money back and go get a more reliable competitors band I'm going to do now.";Product does not last.

21;88.0;1.0;5.0;I give it negative five stars. This product suffers from serious quality issues and the battery will die in a short period of time.

Don't be drawn in by the cool functionality - it simply does not work.;Do not buy this product
64;89.0;5.0;6.0;Does exactly what is advertised.  You know how much you slept, deeply and light.  How many times you got up during the night.  Then you switch it to steps when you get up and at the end of the day, the Up band tells you how many steps you took.  You can program in your weight and know how many calories you burned that day.  Would recommend.;Great Product
24;90.0;1.0;5.0;"Like many others, I initially loved my Up band - I would have given it five stars then.  The iPhone app is really great and the band, while a tad bulky, wears well and worked great.\n\nFor about two months.  By then, the rubber covering had stretched so much that it went over on both ends - on the button side, I couldn't push the button any more, and on the connector side, could barely get the cover on any more.  Ok, so that can happen, bad batch or so - I called customer service.  Great agent, prompt answer. ""Yes, she had seen this a lot, we'll send you a new band and then you just return the old one once it's there.""  The band arrived within a few days, everything worked great again.\n\nFor another two months, than the same thing happened.  This time, the agent had never heard of this problem (??), but the exchange went just as well.\n\nAbout two months again - this time, while the rubber was again getting a bit long again, that wasn't the main issue - this time, the band wouldn't synch any more, despite trying all the suggested procedures.  The iPhone realizes the band is plugged it, it noodles for a few seconds, then nothing is downloaded or happens at all.  So, I called again, same general process (I asked, since this was Problem #3, if I could pay the difference and get the Up 24 instead - no, no can do).  New band arrives promptly, again.\n\nIt quit synching after less than a week.  Did a soft reset, that fixed it this time.  For another week or so, now it again won't work.  At this point, I am not sure if I'll bother calling again - obviously, the band is crap and problems are so commonplace that no replacement will work for long either.\n\nNote that I don't do anything but walk with the band, I even take (always did) it off for showers and washing dishes although allegedly it can handle that.  The band isn't exposed to anything one wouldn't expect it to see in the life of a moderate active adult, yet it obviously can't handle that.\n\nBottom line: great iphone app, great customer service (which is good, since it's needed roughly every other month), but an absolutely crap band.  People that give it great reviews either are unbelievably lucky or post a review soon after they receive the band and then don't get back to fix it (or never use it after the initial honeymoon period).  My sister in law, who originally recommended it when she had hers new, gave up after the second replacement.\n\nMy husband has a Fitbit (the clip on variety).  While the iphone app isn't as nice, the device has worked flawlessly for ten months now, including some major hikes.  I'll get one of those next.\n\nStay away!!!";Ten months, four bands -- too bad, really.  Great app, great customer service, but crap hardware defeats the purpose.
84;91.0;1.0;6.0;"I got the 2nd generation UP band for Christmas and LOVED it. It was amazing and I lost 7 pounds just by tracking my steps and food. Unfortunately, 3 weeks later, it stopped logging data. I'd plug the band in, it said it was synchronizing data, but then no data would appear. I logged a service request on the Jawbone website, and after a day did not hear anything back. So, I put a complaint on their Facebook page. After that, I got simultaneous instructions (from both Jawbone customer service and the Facebook page) instructing on how to do a Soft Reset. I tried to do it at least 20 times but it did not work. So, I sent an email back telling them so. More than a day later, I got another email telling me how to do a Hard Reset, which erases all the data and makes the band ""like new"" again. That approach worked great! For all of 5 minutes, then it stopped logging data again. But, it did manage to waste another day & a half in my wait to get a replacement. After finally getting someone on the phone, she cheerfully agreed that I needed a new one and they would send me a return postage label ""soon."" TWO DAYS LATER, I called them again to find out what exactly ""soon"" means to them (answer: 48-72 hours before they can send a label, no reason given why that should be). All told, it took approximately 2 weeks to get a replacement band, after the first one had only worked for 3 weeks. It didn't work for almost as long as it worked.\n\nThe 2nd band never worked properly at all. Every time I tried to plug it in, it would drain power instead of charging. I tried all different outlets in the house, several computers, everything I could think of. Finally, the only thing that worked was doing a Soft Reset on the band every single time I wanted to charge it. This is not supposed to be how it works, but I had such a bad experience with customer service that I was willing to work around it. Unfortunately, now it has completely stopped logging data, just like the last band. It doesn't work. They both didn't work. It is garbage.\n\nIt was awesome the first time around, I loved using it and was so motivated. I told everyone I knew how great it was. But after the first time it broke, my motivation broke right along with it. After waiting 2 weeks to get a new one, I was no longer excited to get my 10,000 steps and I only logged my food on good days. I didn't check the charts anymore. I felt like it could quit on my anytime so I didn't want to rely on it too much. Ironically, this week I was finally getting back into a good routine with more exercise and tracking my nutrition, so of course now it breaks again. I'm so disappointed and frustrated. I loved it when it worked but I can't recommend this to anyone. They don't have the bugs worked out of it yet. They can't make one that works reliably. Apparently the 1st Gen worked even worse than the one I have, but I can tell you for certain that the 2nd Gen is not there yet either. Do not buy this. You will be disappointed.";Great product, when it works! Which is never!
87;92.0;1.0;6.0;After purchasing this product, I read a few reviews.  Wish I had read them before purchasing the wristband.  For the first two weeks, the band worked fantastic.  The app on the iPhone was easy to use as was the band.  However, the third week the band stopped tracking sleep.  Now, five weeks after purchase, it doesn't work at all.  In fact, the only button on the band has fallen off.  If Jawbone could fix all of the problems with this band, it is a fantastic way to track your steps as well as sleep patterns.  The app shows trend anaylsis and gives tips everyday.  You can also track your food, however I found that hard to do.;Don't waste your money!

""the best technology is that which gets out of the way and lets people live their lives"".\n\nI am a technologist, programmer, Outdoor Enthusiast, adventurer, an early adopter, extremely web savvy and train those around me of emerging products. With that said, I think this generation has it COMPLETELY BACKWARDS with their ideas of what good tech devices are. However, JAWBONE x YVES BEHAR GET IT RIGHT.\n\n**Why this is better than a Fitbit or Fuelband:\n-- I LIKE not having a screen. I like not thinking i'm wearing a tech gadget. It looks like jewelry. You already have a smartphone, how many more screens do you want to carry around and worry about cracking/scratching up/frying (darn my screen is dead..)?\n-- It doesnt look like an electronic device, and it doesn't look like it has a battery inside. The fitbit looks like a pager or a bug. The fuelband looks like a ridiculous prop from a 1990's futuristic sci-fi movie. The UP is technology more seamlessly integrated that it disappears.\n\nNo screens. No fussy buttons and controls. No stress of 'too many devices, too many social media networks, too many things in this culture to keep up with'.\nThe Jawbone UP is invisible, and let's you get back to your life before all these distractions. YOU are in control of when you would like feedback on your information.\n\n**The Bluetooth Debate:\nInitially I was going to wait until they came out with the next version hoping they had bluetooth 3.0 but I bought it now and I actually kinda like that more. I like that I have a choice in when I want to engage with the App, it's like the OFF SWITCH we never have for facebook, twitter, instagram, etc.. that is starting to drive young adults away from these sites in a search to reclaim their lives.\n\nDo we really want to continue living in this world where everytime there is an awkward pause in conversation people just look into their lap and pull out their phone and tune out from friends... that is the wrong way to go. Having it sync 24/7 would mean its an ever present distraction which is another heap on the dungpile of a very distracted culture... and it would make you feel like you are wearing a gadget that is part of the problem of too-many-messages/notifications/alerts vs something that gives you feedback when YOU want.\n\n**DESIGN:\n1. The bracelet itself is extremely sturdy, and doesn't feel cheap. I own the Navy Blue and it looks chic. I turn my cap inward so you don't see the word ""jawbone"" it's hidden on the inside.\n2. Packaging is minimal and easy to set up- a good indicator of your coming experience with the product.\n3. Also I love the App, its so fun and user intuitive. The sleep charts are amazing. The vibrating smart sleep alarm clock is amazing.\n\n4. The Fatal Flaw:\nThe cap is a nightmare, i would be afraid to take the cap off in public and risk losing it as it is small and is prone to fall into cracks. it also looks like a pen cap so you are not that likely to find it. Also the replacement for $7 or so is steep. The cap should have had a rubber band that attached it to the wristband.\n\n5. My only concern with using the headphone jack is that I'm afraid the wear of shoving it in and yanking it out so much will ultimately damage and loosen the jack on my iphone and I'll have to pay for a repair. I would advise instead, if they go with bluetooth, that you should be able to bump/tap your bracelet to your smartphone for it to sync.";Wearable Smart Jewelry for the Anti-technology World
100;95.0;2.0;6.0;The concept is great. v2 is even more convincing.\nAfter two months of use, the battery just died. Its not just my case, there are many others that experience the same.\nThe Jawbone UP is a serious failure and they should refund all those tens of thousands of frustrated customers like me.\nI truly like the product but it was never ready for primetime.\nWait for Apple :-);Great product that lasts no more than 2 months
109;96.0;2.0;6.0;"I've had mine for about a month now and here is my experience.\n\nIt does a decent job tracking your sleep. I'm not sure how it knows you are truly asleep vs just laying still. I'd say what it classifies as deep sleep is actual sleep. Not sure that really means rem sleep. What it classifies as light sleep may be dozing or you lying still and getting rest.  Putting the band in and out of sleep mode is just a button press when I turn off the light.\n\nIt tracks steps but I've not yet compared its reading to traditional pedometers.\n\nTiming workouts like riding a stationary bike is easy. Just double press the button to start and stop the internal timer. When you sync the band with the app you classify what that workout was. Figuring out what intensity to use isn't as clear.\n\nAfter a few weeks I got used to the band being around my wrist and don't really deal it anymore. But the largest size is not large enough for folks 6 feet tall or taller as the band does put very slight pressure on your wrist. Think of it as sleeping with your wristwatch strapped on.\n\nThe food tracking system is a bit problematic. This is all done via the Up app on the phone and not tied to the band itself. However setting up a catalog of what you eat and managing it so the calorie totals produce something useful is problematic and I'm not sure of you can really do it. Ideally one could set up a weekly quota that gets consumed by logging foods and replenished via walking and exercising similar to how Weight Watchers does it. Up can get there but they need to work on the app and data management system.\n\nBut most significantly, buy lots of extra caps when you buy a band. Since the caps are not attached to the band they can be knocked off by pulling on or off jackets and sweaters when your hand ad band go through a narrow opening. And loose it you will. I lost mine a month in after trying very hard to not loose it. The problem is caps are only sold in 3 packs and with shipping can be quite expensive. My though is that the new up band should come with 3 spare caps right out of the box from Jawbone. The extra caps should come 5 or 10 to a bag given they cost a penny each to make.\n\nSo for the expensive cap replacement process and the marginally useful food/calorie tracking solution and no sizes for folks over 6 feet tall and the up looses 2 stars.\n\n------\n\nUpdate Oct 2013\nI'm taking away another star due to the hardware having longevity issues.  The original band I purchased about 10 months ago worked for about 3 months and then the battery would not last an entire 9-10 days on a full charge but run out in 4 days, dropping as much as 20-30 percent in a single day.  Jawbone's warranty support did get me a new band without any hassle after trying the soft and hard reset methods they have one go through.  That replacement band has been working find over the past 6+ months and I'd put the issue to rest as a bad unit; its why one has warranties.  But last week the replacement failed as well , in a new and different way.\n\nI use my band 24/7, taking it off only to shower (I know I don't have to but I choose to), and I use it to track my sleep, so push the button on the end at least 2-3 times per day, once to silence the vibrating alarm that wakes me in the morning, a long press to disengage sleep mode, and another long press to engage sleep mode at the end of the day.  So at least 3, maybe 4 presses a day if I need to validate the mode its in as I go to sleep.\n\nLast week one morning, I had a seemingly difficult time getting the alarm to shut off.  Sleep as I was I thought I wasn't pressing the button right, and continued trying.. after a few tries the alarm shut off.  I then saw I was having problems getting it out of sleep mode with the long press.  I thought initially the mechanical button on the end was worn out (after 6-7 months ~ 750 presses? that seemed very unusual).  But the a few days later, as the ability to engage/disengage sleep mode became more difficult, I noticed the light wasn't always coming on either.  If I pinched the top/bottom of the band near the button end I could get the button and light to work and that went on for a day or two and then it totally failed this weekend.  Now nothing gets the band to acknowledge a button press or have the light work.. so I logged another warranty claim.\n\nAs it stands, the band still 'works' - it still counts steps, still charges and syncs with the UP app on my phone.  The alarm still works... it buzzed this morning... but the button doesn't register.. and the light doesn't work.  So there is no I/O with the band directly other than it vibrating.  I synced it with my phone to get it to stop the alarm.. not sure if that did it or if the alarm just gives up after some time.  I know syncing takes the band out of sleep mode, so I thought it might work for the alarm.  I can probably set the app to turn off the alarm and solve the problem that way, but I'm used to the subtle way the band wakes me in the mornings.. .better than that jarring bedside alarm clock.\n\nMy suspicion is the internal structure of the band has failed at a point about an inch away from the end button.  There seems to be an internal break there as the band more easily bends at that point.. .and the resulting flex likely broke internal wiring that connects the light and button to the band's internal electronics.  That would fit with the band still working except not displaying its status light nor responding to button presses.\n\nSo the design still has some issue.. mechanically the structure causes electrical failures after 6-7 months of daily use (removing and putting on the band on average 2x a day (once intentionally and occasionally as it gets partly removed from my putting my hand in my pockets, or in a jacket sleeve, etc. ))  So the design isn't quite there.\n\nIn summary, I 'suspect' that at this point, for your purchase, you will get a band that will likely fail 1-2x during the first year of ownership, while it is under warranty.  Then once out of warranty, you will have to pay for replacements or buy a new band.  Depending on the costs of a replacement (which come with a 90 day warranty) vs a new band you buy (that comes with a 365 day warranty) which option you choose depends on the cost.\n\nBut be prepared for the UP band to be a disposable device.. not because you will loose it but it will fail... so you have to replace it every 12-15 months I suspect (not counting the in-warranty replacements that will happen).\n\nI love the UP band and still feel like it is the best solution for what I wanted (monitor restless sleep, vibrating alarm, pedometer, 7+ days on a charge, wrist worn, able to be worn in sleep)... but its construction and design means it will fail prematurely.  I still recommend it for folks with similar needs, but warn to be prepared for its failure.\n\n---------\n\nUpdate August 2015\nSo after the first Up (rev2) was out of warranty and its replacement had failed, I purchased a new one (cheaper then) in 2014 - to also get a new 1 year warranty.  That new one worked as expected, and as expected failed after 5-6 months, so in late 2014 another warranty replacement. That replacement was working well - I figured now being on my 5th unit in 2 purchases I'd figured out how to not mistreat the thing.  Nope.\n\nJust this past week, for no visible reason, the Up (rev2) that I got as a replacement in late 2014 - failed.  I noticed the blue flower light was fully illuminated or a while.  Button presses did nothing.  Having done several warranty returns at this point I had the 'reset process' down.  So I got out the charging dongle, plugged in the UP into the charging dongle, and while holding down the button, plugged the USB dongle into USB power while holding the button depressed nonstop.  Normally, you get a reset at this point - the light flashes colorfully through some cycles and you can then let go of the button. Not here.  The red light came on briefly and then it went dark. No unplugging, replugging, leaving to charge, retry a reset, does anything except get me an occasional brief blink of red LED, then darkness.\n\nIts toast. again.  After 8 months this time.  Well it is on the long end of the normal 6-8 month lifespan of the Up (rev2).\nThe hardware design is just fundamentally flawed - the just don't hold up to being worn and removed at least once a day to shower.  My guess is when washing dishes or something some splash water must have worked past the exterior into the electronics (again) and that shorted out the internals.  I imagine if I put it in a bag with descendant or rice for some months, and then try to reset and recharge it may come back to life.  However, I'm done with the Up Band (rev 2).\n\nTechnology has advanced and I'll be using the Up2 [two generations newer as it was Up (rev2) -> Up24 -> Up2 (with Up3 & 4 being added sensors in the same basic Up2 design/system) ].\n\nThe Up2 has all of the features I want and like of the Up (smart wake alarm, minimal size so I can sleep in it, and long battery life (though only 7 days vs 10, so it may not go a week) ) and replaced some of the bad with better solutions (no more caps and plug-into-the-smartphone-headphone-jack-to-sync).. bluetooth syncing, and magnetic latched charging.\n\nRather than the spring tension twist-on band, the Up2 has a watch type fiddly clasp- but as its supposedly water resistant for showers, it should only need to be removed for charging (maybe once a week).  This should put WAY less tension on the mechanical structure and I'm hoping will lead to much less (none?) failure do to mechanical break or leak in the body or electronics.  I'll be listing my review of the Up2 in the Up2 product..  Alas, no more blue.. back to black.";Order extra caps - Expect hardware failure after 6-8 months.
111;97.0;1.0;6.0;I guess the design team was told to focus strictly on the mobile hipster demographic that can never sit down long enough to do anything on a PC or Mac.  This device only syncs data to an iOS device.  Really???  Would it really be that hard to create a desktop interface for OSX?;No Desktop Sync
112;98.0;1.0;6.0;I have been using the Up sine 12/31/2012.  Purchased from Best Buy.  I have been surprised how motivated I am to get up and go for a walk to meet and exceed the goals i have set.  I also really like the app, although there are certain little things I could see need to be improved.  My problem is that after only 3 weeks of use, the band has stopped vibrating.  Now you might not think that is a big deal, but what really made this feature stand out, was the silent alarm.  Nothing has been better than waking up to the slight vibration of the band.  The jawbone uses your sleep data to calculate the perfect time for this to happen.  the other bad thing about not having the vibrating feature work, is it's nice to know when i have changed from awake to sleep without looking at my band, and the reminders I had set every hour to get up from desk and go for a short walk.\n\nI have noticed multiple other users in the Up forums with this same problem.  Here is my problem with Jawbone.  This is clearly a defect of their product.  Unfortunately for me, I did not save the receipt, and now I cannot return for replacement according to Jawbones warranty/return policy!!!  Even though this band has a serial number, they assume that I must have stolen their product?!?!!??\n\nSo, after 3 weeks of use, the band no longer functions as it should and I am now stuck with an inferior product.  I guess I'll just have to call my CC company and dispute the charges.;Love the Concept, not too happy with quality and policies
114;99.0;3.0;6.0;Let me first start off by saying this is my FIRST fitness tracking device I have owned. My purpose for this purchase is to track my activity on a daily basis (or lack thereof) and equally important- sleep.\n\nI looked at all available options when I made this purchase. I decided against Fitbit since there is no decent way to keep that device secured from loss. Just putting it in my pocket scares me as an easy way to loose it and at $99 it's something I don't want to have to worry about.\n\nThat left the Nike+ Fuelband or the Jawbone Up as my two option. What sold me on the Jawbone is the ability to track sleep, along with activity.\n\nI have been using the Up for the last two weeks, everyday, only taking it off to charge it. The hardware itself seems good. I have taken it into the pool swimming for a few hours at a time and in the hottub, it has stood up to the waterproof claim thus far and that is a huge plus. The band itself it comfortable, the only issue I have is that if your putting on long sleeves it will easily fall off. This can be frustrating and worry's me a little since I can't easily shell out another $130 if I loose it. Some sort of latch to close it together would be nice. Also, another flaw to note is there is no wireless syncing capabilities. Bummer and kind of funny considering Jawbone is a company who has pioneered premium bluetooth products as long as I can remember. My guess is they did this to save on battery life, which is understandable but they could have used Bluetooth 4.0 protocol which drains significantly less battery (what the Fitbit Flex will be using when it comes out.)\n\nThe software is great... if you have an iPhone. If you don't, your out of luck for the time being. No Android support, yet (but they do say it is under development). I have to use my iPad since I use Android on my phone. The iPad works BUT it is not a universal app so it shows up tiny on the iPad, expand it and it looks choppy. It will do for now but I certainly hope they are working hard to get out an Android app sooner than later.\n\nThe last is the sleep tracking. This is cool. I use this every night and it really does a good job breaking down your sleeping patterns. It use actigraphy to monitor rest/active cycles (Wikipedia it for more info).\n\nSo all in a I think it is a great device, still in the early stages as far as software and compatibility but out of all of the other options, Jawbone is a TOP competitor in the fitness tracking game.;Good fitness tracker with some flaws
115;100.0;1.0;6.0;I love the idea behind jawbone up. They have nailed the usability and features. But I can't recommend the Up because Jawbone has consistently failed to deliver a quality product. I had the original Up and had hoped the issue that forced them to discontinue it would be fixed with this edition. But after 50 days, my second generation Up's battery would not hold a charge - the same issue as the first generation.;Shoddy workmanship on a great idea
120;101.0;5.0;6.0;I have been using the UP band for about 5 weeks now and I find it very useful for tracking my steps and also my sleep patterns. The battery life on the device is great since I can get at least 7 days without recharging. The UP has a great feature that you can set a reminder to get up periodically if you haven't moved in awhile. The default is 15 minutes but I changed mine to 30 minutes because sometimes you're in meetings. Some people might find that syncing through the headphone jack is cumbersome but I think it is more reliable than Bluetooth (will explain later). I do not really use the food portion of the app because it is a bit cumbersome to either take a picture of your food or manually type it in. As for the UP's competition, I did try the FitBit and had a rather bad experience since it would not sync consistently over Bluetooth and that seemed to drain the battery quite quickly. In addition, I lost my FitBit after 2 weeks since it fell off of my belt. Therefore I like the design of the UP since it is on your wrist. I would highly recommend if you want an easy way to monitor your health in 2013!;Great for tracking steps and sleep! Also tried the FitBit but did not like as much
27;102.0;2.0;5.0;Good idea for a product, but something that lasts for 2 months is not worth it, at least not at this price.\nI like the tracking and information it provides, but it stopped working after less than 2 months. Amazon's return policy has expired, so now I have to see if the manufacturer will handle it.\n\nI will update once I get a response from the manufacturer, and hopefully they will stand behind their product so I can get a better idea as to the product's overall effectiveness.\n\nBe careful if buying. I read the reviews and saw how mixed they were, but I still wanted to try it for myself. Now I feel like I made the wrong decision.;Worked for about 2 months, not worth it.
28;103.0;1.0;5.0;Loved the jawbone right up until it died.  Contacted amazon and they will not return over 30 days (mine died around the 4 month mark), so I am now holding on to a more than $100 non-functional wrist band.  While it was working, the product seemed very accurate and certainly motivated me to move more and watch what I ate.  Shame.;Find an alternative- faulty
33;104.0;2.0;5.0;Unfortunately my experience with the UP band was terrible. The battery life decreased from 10 days to 1 day within less than two weeks. I had to recharge my band literally everyday. I would either charge while I slept, which defeats the purpose of tracking sleep. Or I would charge during the day, making it pointless to even have. It was such a chore just to keep my band charged I simply gave up.;Terrible Battery Life
34;105.0;1.0;5.0;I am so disappointed in this product after spending clost to $300(for my husband and I).  We have had our bands since April.  In June mine just stopped working out of nowhere.  Went to bed it was fine, woke up to download the data and NOTHING, it did not sync at all.  It also no longer held a battery charge.  I contact Jawbone and they acted like they cared and sent me a new band...ok awesome!  however about 2 months into received the second band the SAME thing was happening and I have no been able to use it since.  I've contacted Jawbone via phone, e-mail, smoke signals, anyway that I can think of wanting my money back and they refuse to do so because I bought it at an outside vendor(Apple Store) and not directly from them.  Said I had to follow the store's return policy.  well that was two weeks so it did me NO good.  In July my husband's also stopped working with the same issues.  This product is the worst out there....do not buy it, I wouldn't trust any of their bands.  I should have gone woth my gut and bought the Nike Fuelband.  I'm so mad that I spent close to $300 and they were both broken in less than 6 months.  Thinking of starting a class action suit...;DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
8;106.0;4.0;6.0;I had the first version, had lots of trouble sync'ing with iPhone. Waited for the next version hoping to see a bluetooth sync from the company who is the pioneer in bluetooth...instead it is audio jack again!!\nWonderful product, very well designed...but the syncing with audio jack! BAD!! Have to sync atleast once a day, how much can these cap will stay? last time I lost too many, cause they wear-out and become loose!!\nSorry to review it before using it!! Will wait for it...and will update after using it!;still audio jack for sync!!!
35;107.0;1.0;5.0;I purchashed the Up band in April 2013 and since that time I am on my 4th replacement from Jawbone.  My band works fine for a while then it stops, like over night it stops.  It won't charge, respond or sync.  I am very frustrated and absolulately hate this product.  I can't return it to Amazon because my return window has closed.  Jawbone will not refund my money because I didn't buy it from them.  At first I thought it was me but now that I've read some of the reviews I know it's not unique to me, it's something other users have experienced.  I wish I had not spent 129 dollars on this piece of crap.  I hate it and would not recommend it to anyone.  I loved it when it worked.  I like the sleep, activity and nutrition features and I especially like the water resistant feature.  I just can't get past 30 days with consistant functionality.  Whatever the bugs are, Jawbone seriously needs to fix them and reimburse everyone who has experienced shut down.;I hate this band
36;108.0;1.0;5.0;Purchased and started using the Up Band in early 2013, even recommended it to others, but after about forty days of use it stopped working. I purchased it from Amazon and they refunded my money.  A friend bought one around the same time and hers stopped working a week after mine did and was also returned. I read that the first introduction of this product was fraught with technical failure. I had hope that the kinks were worked out when the band was re-introduced but clearly product testing is taking a back seat to a race to market.  It's a shame because I have wireless speakers by Jawbone that I absolutely love and you never get a second chance to make a first impression.;Love Jawbone speakers, but hate Up Band
37;109.0;4.0;5.0;I purchased this Up band at a local box store several months ago.  I chose it because of its look, as well as reviews that I read.  I wanted to get a closer approximation of my activities than my rough guesses were providing and I wanted to see what it would tell me about my sleep habits.\nI can say that it does both relatively well, but I have some reservations.\n\nOVERALL (short version):\nSimple to wear, does not fall off easy.\nLoss of cap lessens appearance.  Wish this was more integrated so not easy to lose.\nOnly output on band itself is lights, need to sync for data\nNeed to plug in for data (no wireless or BT), so low impact battery-wise\n7-day battery is nice\nData is not portable, limited to use in apps\nData on sleep, not sure how to use, no non-pay apps to use this with, except for basics.\n\nINITIAL SETUP:\nThis was a bit rocky only in that the band did not at first work.  I plugged it into my computers USB port for a while and it still did not work.  I found out that was user error, as my USB does not charge on my computer unless the lid is open.  Did not know that.  Finally it started up and I was in business.  Created my account and I was all set.\n\nUSAGE:\nIts a bracelet, this is straightforward.  However if you are female, you need to pick something that goes with your jewelry.  I don't wear any (unless Im going out), so that was easy. But given that I like to wear dressy bracelets on occasion, this was a minor issue.  So I just didn't wear it then. Kinda defeats the purpose if it is a night out dancing, but such is life.\nI never wore it in the shower, though it says you can.\nThere are two pieces to this bracelet.  One being the main bracelet and the other being an end cap to cover the connector that goes in your computer USB connector.  I lost the end cap after a month (my mistake, it did not fall off) so it does not look as cool as it used to.  I can probably buy one online, if I had to.\nAlso this bracelet, though it has no latch, but it just shaped and springy, has only come off twice on me in several months of usage.  Once while sleeping and another time when my cat for some reason, thought he needed to run off with it.\n\nTo see the data you need to sync by attaching this to your phone earpiece connection.  This takes a few seconds if only a day or so of data, or a little longer if it has been a while.\n\nDATA:\nLets cut to the chase, you have a few things you can do.  I never used it as a stop watch of any type, so I cant speak to that, but you have to tell it when you are going to sleep and when you wake.  Forget that step and you have compromised your data.  I forgot telling it I was going to sleep a few times and it just shows the sleep cycle as missing.\n\nFor awake you get the frequency and intensity of your workouts.  So if you jogged or walked a mile, it will be well noted. Do Pilates or Yoga and it will be more impressed by your walk to these activities, so obviously intensity is not by heart rate, but by movement of the device.\n\nFor asleep you get times when you were awake, light sleep and deep sleep.  I can only assume it determines this based on your movement when it has been notified that you are sleeping.  For a time, I used this band with a WiThings Pulse at the same time and the data was different.  Not sure why.  So I don't know how valuable this information is.  There is a Sleepio App you can port this to (and costs for membership to do so after the initial period), but I saw no other way for you to look at the data except for the UP app itself.  I never joined Sleepio.\n\nI will continue to see if this information can be pushed to a computer, as I would like a chance to push this into an excel spreadsheet and look at trends.  Without that this band becomes less and less useful for me.\n\nSOFTWARE ON PHONE:\nThis is very simple and very graphical.  Easy to visualize what it is telling you.\nFor example, if you want to walk 10,000 steps a day, you will get told if you met that goal or not right on the front screen. You can get the exact data within.  Similarly if you get less than 8 hours of sleep, you know that on the top screen (only on weekends for me).  If you think you were up from 3:23AM to 4AM, you can see that too.  I did note, however that there are times I thought I was awake and the band recorded this as light sleep. Not 100% sure if it was right or I was.\n\nWhat I found hard to do, was compare trends in data.  For instance, is my deep sleep increasing from day to day or not.  What are the trends?  This is done with a bar chart in the app, but, not detailed enough for me.  I would also know in these sets if there was a gap in the data and it does not show that, unless I look back on daily.\n\nI don't know how much longer I will wear the band.  Im not sure what to do with the data.  I had gotten it primarily to examine my sleeping and to see if I was getting the 10,000 steps a day I should (no I only get 6000 regularly and 12000 to 15000 on more active days). I might continue to wear it, to see if I can get regularly up to the 10000 steps.\n\nCOMPARING TO THE WITHINGS PULSE\nAt first I preferred the Withings pulse when I got it after, as it shows data right on it.  I liked also the fact you could see the time. It also does heart rate on request.  However I found since it was not on my wrist like the Up band (thought it has a wrist strap, that is recommended only for night-time wear), I tended to wear it less and less. The data also that I got seemed less accurate. If you hang it on a belt loop the floppiness of the belt loop can make 100 steps look like 15.  The velcroed band was bigger and fell off at night a lot.\nI don't care that the data is sent via bluetooth (on the Pulse) that is actually a bit fussier than just plugging the UP in.  The data for all purposes is the same.  Both can go to WiThings, but both are trapped in these apps.;Informative, but limited

The first band stopped vibrating during all features and would not correct itself after following reset recommendations by customer service; first band was replaced after just a few months. My second band's button stopped working after just a few months as well. Again, the button did not begin working even after all reset options were completed per customer service. I am now on my 3rd band, and so far it is working just fine.\n\nGlitches have remained throughout all 3 bands including: a) timed workouts not synced during that same day get lost and unrecorded, b) I recently lost all data from 3 days as the band uploaded all information, but did not get recorded on my iPhone app, c) the button was designed in a square shape with sharp edges. Loved ones have been scratched, clothes have been snagged, and I have nursed some wounds myself.\n\nCustomer service has been very good. I just wish the good people at Jawbone Customer Service had a better product to help us with. I do not recommend purchasing the UP band until Generation 3. Great idea, but still needs much work to be mass marketed. Any product that is replaced 2 times during the first year of use is in need of a tremendous overhaul.";3rd Time is a Charm
50;112.0;1.0;5.0;My wife and I ordered the Up band in May. It took about 3 weeks to arrive but they did finally come. The app is very slick and I love the silent alarm feature. I wake up at 4:00am to workout and now I no longer wake my wife up in the mornings. I don't have to worry about losing the band like I do other similar devices. It only takes 10-15 minutes to charge and the battery lasts for 10 days. Why only 1 star? It doesn't last. My sister in law's band died first...it simply wouldn't charge up or hold a charge. Then my wife's battery went out...and then my brother in law's. I also ordered 8 of these for my patients to use (I work with overweight and obese populations) and 6 reported problems...mostly battery problems but 2 wouldn't vibrate at all anymore. Then my band wouldn't charge up at all either. I sent Jawbone an e-mail and they told me they would send a package within 2 business days and that I should put my now dead band into the return package. It's been 23 business days and no e-mail or package. Overall, this is not worth the money and the customer service is horrible. Between my family and patients, I've noticed the band has an average lifespan of about 6 weeks.;It's fun while it lasts...
57;113.0;1.0;5.0;"My advice: ***AVOID*** the Jawbone UP!!!!!!  DO ***NOT*** spend your hard-earned money on a Jawbone UP!!!\n\nIf you want to flush money down the toilet, then just go into your bathroom, throw $130 into your toilet and flush it.  That will be a lot easier than going through the frustration of spending $130 on a Jawbone UP only to have it INEVITABLY fail.\n\nIn January, my wife and I both got a Jawbone UP.  When it works, it's great.  But, the problem is that none of the bands (we've purchased several of them) seem to last more than about six weeks!!  I'm on my FOURTH Jawbone UP in less than six months (that's an average of less than six weeks of ""life span"" for the UP).  To say that is ""terrible"" would be a GROSS understatement.  I would expect that the UP would last, under normal usage, for at least 12-18 months.\n\nAfter my first UP died, I decided I'd stop wearing it while showering (figuring that maybe it really couldn't handle shower water, despite what Jawbone claims).  But, that really hasn't been helpful.\n\nTonight, my wife's UP died.  I bought it on June 26, 2013 (about five weeks ago) -- and it's DEAD!!!  Unbelievable.  Neither a soft nor a hard reset works.  In fact, of the seven UPs that we have purchased, a reset NEVER fixed the problem on ANY of them!!!\n\nNow, you may be asking: If the UP is so crappy, quality-wise, then why on earth have you continued to buy replacements?!?  Well, good question.  Like I said, when the UP works, it's great.  So, I've become somewhat addicted to the information it provides me.  But -- and it's a HUGE ""but"" -- the quality of this products has to be about the WORST I have EVER seen of ANY product I have EVER purchased.  Seriously...needing to replace a $130 item about every six weeks!?!?!?!\n\nUntil Jawbone gets its manufacturing and quality acts together, you should NOT -- and I mean **NOT** -- buy a Jawbone UP.  My advice would be to wait until the ""third generation"" is introduced and THEN wait about six months until the reviews start coming in as to the quality of THAT generation of the UP.  If the reviews are good, then go for it.  Until then, dear readers, you should AVOID buying a Jawbone UP.\n\nHere's another thing: If you post negative comments about the UP on Jawbone's own website, the moderators will delete all of your comments but one.  They do NOT want people to know about how awful the quality is of their product.\n\nAnd, here's the thing: Those guys at Jawbone should LISTEN to people like me.  Why?  Well, I love the band when it works.  Geez, here I am, a guy who really, really, REALLY likes the product...but it seems like a person is shouting into a gigantic, life-sucking black hole when complaining to Jawbone.  FIX THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT, folks!!!  You will then have a WINNER and start making gobs of money.  But, if you don't, then you will FAIL!!  I wish I could get a bullhorn and yell to the head of quality at Jawbone: YOU ARE A LOSER AND YOUR PRODUCT IS TERRIBLE.  FIX IT!!!\n\nTo say that I'm livid about the quality problems with the Jawbone would be like saying I ""don't like"" when I get my hand smashed with a sledge hammer.  In other words, it's a GROSS UNDERSTATEMENT to say that the Jawbone UP has ""quality problems"".\n\nIf I knew with certainty that a Jawbone UP would work, reliably, for at least 18 months (better yet, 24 months), then I'd be happy to shell out even $200 for an UP.  But, to spend $130 for an UP that dies after several weeks?!?!  That is insane...and I must be insane to have purchased several of these things.  I guess it just tells you how GOOD they are then they work.\n\nBut, once again, the bottom line advice is: ***AVOID*** the Jawbone UP....do ***NOT*** buy one (unless you want to shell out $130 every few weeks for a replacement.";The QUALITY of the Jawbone UP is TERRIBLE!!!
58;114.0;5.0;5.0;I have had my Jawbone UP for almost a month now and it has been working flawlessly.  I am hoping that soon the Android app will integrate with MyFitnessPal but right now it only integrates on the iPhone.\n\nAs to the waterproof claim, I can attest to that.  last week I had to jump into a lake to rescue a kid in trouble in deep water and while swimming to him, the band came off and dropped to the bottom of the lake (which was about 6 foot deep where I was) and this lake was dark so I was not able to find it then.  24 HOURS LATER, we were swimming in the same area and a friend found it with thier toes.  I STILL works perfectly.  I was amazed.\n\nSo, 24 hours at the bottom of a lake, I can say that the Jawbone UP band IS waterproof.;Jawbone UP waterproof review

65;116.0;1.0;5.0;"I bought my UP BAND at my local Apple Store rather than Amazon, but I want to warn as many people as possible away from this product. I Intended to buy a FitBit or a NIKE band, but the ""cool kids"" at the Apple store were raving about them and I even met a guy who was replacing a Gen I that had been recalled. I thought, well surely they have fixed the problems?? WRONG!! I loved this UP Band, but almost six weeks to the day the thing sputtered and then died. I thought I had done enough research, but when I went to the website blog http://forums.jawbone.com/t5/TROUBLESHOOTING/UP I found that my problem is the rule rather than the exception. The majority of these items stop working within 2 to 6 weeks, 6 weeks seeming to be the sweet spot. If you are considering buying one of these, please go and search any topic about reliability and warranties, you will see what I am warning you about. Initially, the customer service was wonderful, very responsive, sending me a shipping label to return my band for another one. I was instructed to return my band and charger. Two weeks later I received a reconditioned band and no charger. I contacted custoner service and I was told that the chargers are on back order and I will receive one when they get one for me (I wonder who got the one I returned?) When I went back to the blog, I find that customer service is a one time deal for most people as well. I am totally disillusioned and disappointed to have wasted $150 on this worthless piece of plastic. I have vowed to put a negative review on every site I can access to do my part to stop others from being fleeced by this product. I have very little hope of satisfaction and very little hope of ever having a functional activity band again because I won't risk my hard earned money again on anyone's product!";DO NOT BUY THE UP BAND...TOTAL RIP OFF
66;117.0;1.0;5.0;At first I really enjoyed my UP and liked tracking my activity and especially my sleep as I have problems sleeping.  I've had this for just over a month now and it won't charge - or rapidly discharges when I try to recharge it.  I've researched this online and found that this is a well known issue with the Up band.  For the price of this item, you would think it would be a better product.  I am very disappointed and will be returning it with out replacing it.;Probematic
67;118.0;3.0;5.0;The band was great for the most part.  I loved that it recorded steps taken, sleep time and quality, and calories.  But, the downfall is that when you were biking or walking stairs without moving your arms, the wrist band would tell you that you were being too sedentary, which is funny when your heart is beating off the charts....And, on top of that, my wrist band just stopped syncing and working within about 2-3 weeks of receiving it.  I am in the process of seeing if I can get a replacement, but how frustrating to pay that much for something that bummed out after a few weeks!;My Jawbone Review
69;119.0;2.0;5.0;"Bought the Gen 1 UP band, had the problems, exchanged several bands, great support, but they all died.\n\nNow have had the Gen 2 UP band for 6 months. The band itself is brilliant - love the alarm, love the sleep tracking (curiously amazing accuracy), love activity tracking which is also VERY accurate - especially for daily runs, don't really use food tracking.  Unlike others I LOVE the fact there is no bluetooth; 1) because it maximizes battery life & 2) because I work in a sensitive environment where bluetooth is prohibited, so I can wear the band at work.\n\nWhat's the problem? After 6 months the button (there's only 1) has become less and less responsive to the point that it is now unresponsive (hardware malfunction).  Yes, customer service is going to replace it under the 1yr warrantee.  However, I'm gun-shy after so many issues with the Gen 1 band and see a reasonable chance the button will be inoperable again after another 6 months - just about in time to be outside the warrantee period.  We'll see.\n\nDespite the great performance of the band, because this is Jawbone's second attempt at perfecting an imperfect product I feel I shouldn't be having ANY issues after 6 months.  Time will tell...";2d Gen Still Questionable
73;120.0;2.0;5.0;I really enjoyed my UP until it stopped working just over two weeks after I started using it.  I did read the reviews prior to purchasing it and realized that this seems to be a common problem but I loved the design and concept so much that I decided to take my chances and hope for the best.\n\nI emailed the customer service email address for Jawbone two days ago about getting a replacement band but have not yet heard back from anyone other than the automated reply email that they received my email.  So frustrating!;Loved it until it stopped working, just like so many other reviews
78;121.0;1.0;5.0;I received a Jawbone UP band for Christmas.  It lasted 3 months and died.  I replaced it. That band lasted less than an hour - started charging and died.  I took the band back to Best Buy they agreed it was defective and replaced it.  Got the the new band home and again started charging, and died.  The bands are totally unreliable.  Am returning the third band for a full refund and am looking for an alternative.  Great idea, just does not work.  Very disappointing.  I couldn't believe the first band lasted less than three months but was willing to try again.  Three strikes and UP is OUT!;Defective Manufacturing - Waste of Money - Does NOT WORK
82;122.0;1.0;5.0;"I was so excited version 2 of the UP band truly materialized...that is until about 2 months into usage the band failed.  Then it took a week to get a replacement.  Once the replacement arrived, it too worked for approx 2 months and...guess what:  It failed again.  I've done all that can be done including charging, soft reset and hard reset.  NADA!  Nothing has made a difference! The band has failed.\n\nCall me stupid, but I went through 14 of the v. 1 bands before I finally gave up.  Well...it may have been the fact that I was the laughing stock of my friends that I simply hadn't given up.  Well....I'm not going to go thru this all over again.  And to be told...""we aren't having problems""..... or....""only one percent of bands are problematic.""  Come on!  EVERY SINGLE UP BAND I HAVE PURCHASED OR HAD AS AN EXCHANGE HAS FAILED!  THAT IS A 100% FAILURE RATE.\n\nAt this point, Jawbone should pay me for my time and efforts!  Not to mention the fact that I'll probably need to return the ones I purchased for my nephews too!  I am so very disappointed.\n\nShame on you Jawbone!";EPIC FAIL - 100% FAILURE RATE - RUN!!!!!!
86;123.0;2.0;5.0;"PROS:\n- It has a great alarm setup, that will wake you up when you are not in REM sleep. That alone is a great reason to buy this band, and the only reason I'm putting two stars to it.\n\nCONS:\n- Right off the bat, this band is more expensive than other bands and chips. So you would expect for the quality to be higher than the other bands, but its not.\n- It says that it will resist water, but one of the bands I had, stopped working after my first shower with it\n- The band comes with a USB charger. It does not tell you if that charger should be plugged to a computer, or any other charger that has a USB input. If you charge it once or twice with anything other than a computer USB, the band will stop vibrating, or it will just stop working\n- The band has a button, which you press in different ways to make the band do different things. This button gets jammed easily if it catches lets say, an edge of a jacket, while you are getting dressed, the edge of your desk while you are working, your keyboard, etc. Once this button is jammed, you have no option but to call customer support\n- Customer support can be found through the site. The people in charge are in good moods and will tell you to reset your band in case you are having problems with it. They are always ""having a high volume of requests"" So each mail takes about 3 bushiness days to be answered, and a couple of back and forth exchange of message can take up to 2 weeks, before you get a new band.\n- The software does provide an easy to use UI, but the feedback you get from it is very basic compared to other product already on the market. I think this band was great when it just came out, because there was no competition. Right now, other bands can tell you much more information about yourself.\n\nConclusion: If you are getting this band as an alarm, that is great. If you intend to use it for its features, maybe take a look to other brands which offer more precise information, and will last longer for a lower price.";Had 3, all broke
93;124.0;3.0;5.0;It does all as advertised but the app does not account for times you are not wearing it.  So it averages your stepsover times you are not wearing it, therefore not taking steps.  Also as far as logging food, since allot of what I eat is not prepackaged, figuring out calories and other nutritional info for say a tomato is easy, but for a home made marinara sauce or the pizza it goes on is difficult.  Also the My Library function needs a search option to simplify the search for foods commonly eaten.;Excellent product but...
99;125.0;5.0;5.0;Our salesman at Verizon saw that I had the Jawbone UP and said he wished he would have gotten the UP instead of the Nike band.  I raved about how it told me I was not getting enough sleep- who knew?  It tells me I have to be more active- that I knew.  With the data right in front of my eyes, I realize I can make those numbers look better if I just move!  It is motivating.  I would recommend for people who like the techie aspect of health.;I love it and upload info at least 3 times a day.
113;126.0;1.0;5.0;Looks like the problems haven't been resolved in the 2nd gen model.  Worked perfectly the first week - charged fine the first time.  The second charge took half a day to reach 30% - and won't hold a charge since.\n\nUPDATE:  Jawbone's customer service seems to have gone into hiding.  I've submitted 3 tickets all with no response.  Their live chat isn't going through either.;Unit bricked after 2nd charge.
122;127.0;5.0;5.0;"I've been using the Up for a month now and I like it. It fits well, has a nice accompanying app, and looks good while wearing it. I have tried the Nike Fuelband and a couple of Fitbits (the Ultra and the Zip) and they're not as good as the Up, IMHO. The Fuelband was too thick (noticable when trying to write with a pen or pencil as it elevated my wrist too high off the table) and it was too loose (but if i had bought the next smaller one it would've never clasped onto my wrist). Sizing is a little more flexible with the Up. I am right between sizes with both the Fuelband and the Up and they both tell you to choose the next bigger size, if that's the case. However, after having read that the Up ""stretches out"" a bit over time I decided to go with the smaller size and it has worked perfectly for me (I did try the bigger size also and it was too loose). Compared to my Fitbit I have noticed that the Up shorts me about 1000 steps (about half a mile) per day but I can live with that (I lowered my daily goal by the same amount to compensate). I don't mind having to plug it into my phone to sync and the battery lasts a lot longer than the Fuelband or Larklife because of the lack of Bluetooth (remember, everything in life is a compromise). If the Larklife weren't so garishly colored and so big I might've preferred that but the Up offers most of the same features and then some (I don't believe the Larklife has the ""smart alarm"" feature, which determines the best time to wake you up within 30 minutes of your set time, based on when you're in the lightest phase of sleep) in a smaller and more fashionable package.";Better than Fuelband and Fitbit

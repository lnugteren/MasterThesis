1;1.0;1.0;5.0;The board is of high quality but the cylinder is very poor.  Instead of being a solid block of wood, is a collection of pieces that leave the action when balancing inconsistent and sloppy.  Having grown up with a much higher quality balance board, I was very dissapointed.;Mixed Quality
0;2.0;5.0;126.0;"I remember when my father brought his original balance board home after he packed up his parents house.  All three of us took to the challenge of being able to stay up on it. Just when we started to get bored with it, our renter from our garage taught us to stretch the limits - first, merely learning to jump and then keep your balance. Within weeks, he was doing a 180 degree jump, and then a 360 degree turn. I am looking forward to our kids (8 and 6) working on their balance skills with this toy.\nThis toy needs a smooth, hard surface to work well; linoleum, very smooth concrete or hardwood floors are recommended.  For long-term durability, I would not recommend using it on typical street concrete as the wood roller beam can get dinged up a bit with loose pebbles and then not roll as smoothly.";Balance me out...
14;3.0;2.0;78.0;"I grew up with a ""bongo board"" which is the same as the balance board.  Except the ""base"" (ie the thing the board rolls on) is terrible.  It comes in multiple pieces of circles you have to assemble to make it.  The wood shreds when you roll on it.  It also doesn't feel very stable.  I wished I had spent a couple extra dollars and gotten the ""all plastic"" one or the ""pivet board"".  We haven't even really used it because it makes a mess and I am scared it will break.  This is one item I may have to bring back.  I LOVED my bongo board growing up and it was so much fun.  I thought it would be fun for my children too.  Unfortunately I picked the wrong one.";Disappointed in Balance Board
13;4.0;5.0;25.0;"I LOVE this balance board.  I got it for myself (an adult) and I use it to supplement other workouts...it really gives your ankle & leg muscles you don't ordinarily use a great workout!  It's challenging but not exausting.  I have set it up on the carpet in front of the TV and once I'm on, it's hard to stop!  I also put down an old bathroom mat underneath to protect the carpet.  I imagine it would be a lot more challenging if it were used on a hard, flat surface like linoleum or wood but don't have that option in my house.  The ""wheel"" part of my board came in the box fully assembled, so I'm not sure what happened with the reviewer below who had to assemble this piece herself. Don't know how durable it is since I've had mine less than a year, but so far so good.  A word of warning, if you have little people or curious pets in the house, make sure they are well out of the way since you can lose your balance quickly and send the board flying out from underneath you.  Overall, highly recommended!!";Fun and addictive for all ages!
15;5.0;5.0;19.0;"I ordered this for my 3 sons (ages 7, 5, and 3) as a ""family"" Christmas gift.  Everyone loves it!  Adults visiting for family parties, my 3year old niece, as well as all the other kids and adults in-between.\n\nWhen first taken from the box, the item seemed very simple and not at all sophisticated (okay--primitive!!).  However, once I set it on the carpet the kids immediately wanted to give it a shot.  From there, it has been nothing but constantly used.  We leave it right on our living room floor so everyone who goes by it has to try it at least once.\n\nI have just ordered 3 more as gifts for the other cousins who can't seem to get enough of it when they come to our house.";Praise from Guam
5;6.0;1.0;11.0;I had a dangerous experience while testing this product.  I bought the balance board with excitement because it resembled others I have seen before.  I had an elementary aged child test it out.  He was so enthusiastic!  I held his hand as he got on the board, when he felt comfortable he let go.  Oh my goodness!  That board went dangerously fast left and then right.  It slid out from under him.  He landed on his side on our carpet and was---thankfully---fine.  After telling this story to an experienced skateboarder and hockey player, he asked to try the balance board on carpet as well.  He is an adult with much 'balance' in his life.  The board went wild under him and was difficult to control.  He agreed, not a good fit to use unless surpervised by an adult with elementary aged children.  It is dangerous.  I suppose if you are an adrenline junky, this might be fun.  And a good project for children.  Tell them the story above and have them problem solve how to make this balance board better.  As I believe the top is good, but the circular cylinder underneath creates hazardous curves.  Children will explore the world around them trying to figure out balance.  A wonderful thing for the brain and then maybe they can create a better balance board for the market!;medieval punishment
3;7.0;1.0;8.0;"This product looked  like it was going to be great from the picture on-line, but once we got it opened and saw how it had to be put together and the cheap wooden parts, we were very disappointed.  We did follow the instructions to put it together (the ""roller"" part is a combination of round and square pieces of wood that alternate on a metal rod)\nand found that it didn't even work.  Our overall opinion is that this Balance board will be the cheapest one you find on-line, in price as well as in quality!";Carrom Balance Board
8;8.0;2.0;14.0;As a child I had a friend with one of these, I LOVED hers. When I saw this one, I was elated. it looked like a good flat board on a solid roller.\n\nBoy was I surprised when I got it. It has a RAIL so there is no difficulty and the roller is 4 plywood circles with 6 plywood squares as spacers. Really cheap. I didn't expect that and am very dissapointed. I would recommend shelling out the extra $50.00 and getting an INDO board..;Didn't Expect
4;9.0;2.0;8.0;"Although this product shows a ""wheel"" underneath the board, what is actually there is  a series of wood cut out circles and squares that you assemble alternately yourself.  This construction is wobbly, and does not result in a tight wheel. The board is hard enough to balance on from side to side, without the added instability!";Balance Board balance problem
2;10.0;1.0;6.0;This product was purchased to counter the expensive cost of the Indo boards. The big problem with the board is the roller that you have to assemble from half a dozen pieces of cutout plywood or composite wood. After bolting the pieces together and giving it a spin, I was immediately disappointed by the performance of this. Then upon inspection of the material used for the roller, I noticed immediate wear or deformation of the pressed wood substance and expect this piece to be useless within a month of use.\nI have used other boards to include the Indo boards for hours on end with no such problems. Most of the other makes use a solid piece of wood or molded plastic with great results.\n\nIf I had it to do over I would spend the extra money and get the Indo board without hesitation.;It's no Indo Board
12;11.0;3.0;14.0;Well I read the reviews and it sounded like a fun toy.  So I tried it out before I gave it to my kids.  Well the kids never got it.  I almost broke my back on that thing.  Sounded like a fun toy to practice balance.  Is it really possible to balance on it without holding on to a wall or something?  If so, please enlighten me.  Sounded fun but after I tried it, not so much.  I left it outside and my dog thought the wheel was a chew toy. =0)  I also thought the wheel was somehow attached to the board.  It is not so when you lose your balance the wheel goes a flying.  If you like a challenge then go ahead a buy it.  If you value your spine, then I would think twice.;Not What I Expected
16;12.0;5.0;15.0;I bought this last Christmas for my 10-year old nephew and now every time I visit their house, I'm on it and it is addicting even as a supposed adult.  I keep thinking 'ok I've mastered it I can stay off it and let the kids play', but I keep begging them to let me have a turn.  It is excellent for developing balance skills and we all have fun encouraging each other and taking turns.  Now my 6-year old would like one and I sure hope Santa brings us... I mean, her one this Christmas.\n\nAs for durability - it has always been kept inside and used on carpeting, doing it on a smooth surface is still to challenging for me.  It has held up well even with all the adults using it too.;Well balanced fun
17;13.0;5.0;15.0;"I bought this ""toy"" for my 6 and 10 year old girls - they love it! My kids are very active and this is a great way for them to burn up that extra energy. Everyboby in our house loves to play on this, even me! In fact I kind of hog it! Anyways the only thing we have to be careful of is our 15 month old daughter. Since the board does rolls, it can easily crush little toes standing too close. We put down a sturdy rug and our rule is that no one go on the rug while the board is being used. Easy solution! Hope you enjoy this as much as we do!";great investment!
7;14.0;5.0;10.0;This toy is exactly like the Indo boards that are almost twice the price. It is SO much fun for anyone, but it is also wonderful for skateboarders, surfers, dancers, any athlete, and anyone who wants to improve thier balance. Physical therapists often use a board and a foam roller to help patients. I would not recommend it for anyone under the age of 8, but you can hardly seperate kids from them. Is a great ab and thigh exercise you can do while watching tv. Make sure to try on a carpet surface first. Board can shot out suddenly if you lean over to far. Need at least a four or five foot open space to do it safely.;Balance Board
18;15.0;5.0;13.0;"We have an eight-year-old and ten-year-old.  This toy is a hit with them and with us as well.  It is always out, visiting friends can't resist hopping on.  This toy is also recommended and used in the ""smart school"" program for increasing balance skills and overall physical well-being.  You can't go wrong with this one!!!!";Balance Board Fun
6;16.0;4.0;6.0;"I ordered one of these for my granddaughter because I had enjoyed the same thing so much when I was little, and also because I saw it as a way she could amuse herself without constant parental involvement.  But as it turns out, it's not the same.  At 5, she enjoys it but can't manage it by herself without falling off; she can only do it while holding both of her father's hands.  When I finally saw her using it, I understood why.  My old balance board had a solid wood or hard rubber cylinder, like the Indo Board, and rolled freely even on a rough stone surface. The cylinder on this one has three wheels made out of apparently unsanded plywood, which don't roll freely but kind of lurch from side to side, so that it's very difficult for a small child (or grandmother!) to manage without falling. Unless your family is more athletic than mine, I'd recommend going for the higher-priced one. I would have revised my rating downwards, but this program won't let me.";Too challenging for a small 5-year-old
10;17.0;5.0;6.0;We have had our board for about 2 years.  It is still in great shape with no splinters or anything coming undone.  My 3 boys (ages 12,8,and 3 at the time) were a bit leary to get on it at first. Once they did I couldn't get them off!  At first I helped them by holding their hands but after only about a week they got the hang of it and we were timing each of them to see who could stay on the longest.  I have a hard time with it but my husband loves it too. It is great excercise and allows kids to learn how to keep their balance when it starts to slip. I am buying 2 more boards for my nephews for this Christmas.;Great gift!
11;18.0;5.0;6.0;FABULOUS!!!  I bought this for our 9 year old...No one can resist practicing balancing on it, often for long stretches of time, and including not only our child's freinds, but often their parents, and even grandparents!  Everyone loves this balance board.  It's extremely sturdy/heavyweight/durable, seems to be a professional quality sports item- just like you might see in school gyms, or in use for professional sports players training.  Seems fine for younger children too. Seems indestructible.  No reqrets on this purchase- well worth the investment!;Anonomous
9;19.0;5.0;5.0;My father made a balance board much like this one when I was much younger. In my progressing age, I have knee problems and thought how a balance board would help strengthen the knees and develop balance and torso strength. It was like riding a bicycle - it wasn't long before I was holding a good balance. My teenaged adult child commented that I ought to take up snowboarding! Hint - don't look down at your feet. Focus straight ahead and the balance will come to you.  As a child, my siblings would fight to ride the board while watching TV. The rule was, if the board touched the ground, you were off.;Old dog and new tricks

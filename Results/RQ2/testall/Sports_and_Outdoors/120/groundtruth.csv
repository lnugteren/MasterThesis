0;1.0;1.0;49.0;Okay, here's the deal. When I first bought this pitcher 2 weeks ago I was incredibly excited, I read all the reviews, got hyped about the product and couldn't wait to try it out. Got my pitcher in the mail, and immediately started testing all my water sources (my house, my work, bottled water) and I was shocked to find out that the water in my home was in the 400's. Just as advertised, the product worked and reduced my water readings to 000. For comparison, my walmart brand filters in my old pitched did not reduce the TDS reading AT ALL. Everything was fine until this week (after using the pitcher for a total of 10 days) when i started noticing my water tasted a little funny. Prior to this, I had been testing my filtered water every 2 days, which it continually read 000. So I retested my filtered water and it read 763! I was absolutely disgusted. I then tested my tap water again, and it read 440. So I completely emptied my pitcher, and tried filling it up again and got the same results. I called the company to complain, and they told me that because my water TDS level was so high to begin with that my filter life expectancy was going to be lower, and that having a HIGHER concentration then the tap water after the filter life has expired was to be expected.\nI understand that I may not get the full life expectancy of the filter with a higher then average TDS level in my tap water, but replacing these filters every 10 days is just not affordable at the price of these filters. Additionally, they recommend you change your filters when your water reaches 006, however when i tested my water 2 days prior to this extreme TDS elevation, it read 000. I would expect that there would be a GRADUAL increase in the TDS level over time, however it appeared to go from 000 to 763 overnight. And believe me, the 763 water was so concentrated with..... who knows what, it made the water taste absolutely disgusting (i'm not exaggerating).;Buyer beware: signficantly shorter filter life!
57;2.0;5.0;1717.0;"ZeroWater is the reigning King of low-cost water filtration devices.\nSeeing your water purity go from 150 to 250 PPM of contaminants, down to literally ""000"" is exciting.\nNo other affordably-priced water filters can do that.  I give it ""Five Stars"" for quality and affordability.\n\nHowever, there is a ""dirty little secret"" that ZeroWater desperately hopes you don't discover:\n... how to make their water filters last 5 times as long, without sacrificing water purity.\nI will tell you the secret:\n\nThe company makes its money on selling you $10 replacement water filters that only last about 30 to 50 gallons,\nand then the water impurity level starts to read more than ""0.06"" (the company-recommended filter-change interval).\nFor most couples or small families... that means a new $10 filter about every month.\n\nWait a minute!  You mean that this filter purifies my tap water from over 150.00 PPM down to a negligible 0.06 PPM,\nand at that point... while the filter is still operating at OVER 99.9% EFFICIENCY... I'm supposed to discard it,\nand buy another of your $10 filters?  Because 99.9%+ purity is somehow ""unacceptable""?  That's crazy perfectionism!\n\nHere is the SECRET to maintaining a purity rating of under 006 PPM for 5 times as long as the projected\n30 to 50 gallons per filter... to get instead 150 to 250 gallons per filter replacement:\n\nStep One: Buy ZeroWater's big 23-Cup Filter Device (Item # ZD-018) for less than $40 on Amazon.\n\nStep Two: Buy ZeroWater's 10-Cup Pitcher Filter (Item # ZP-010) for less than $30 on Amazon.\n\nStep Three: ""THE SECRET CYCLE""...\nFill the easy-to-manuever 10-Cup Pitcher at your kitchen sink, and filter your water through it...\n... and THEN... pour that already-filtered-water (reading 000 - 100% pure) into your big 23-Cup Filter that\nstays in your refrigerator and let that filtered water be filtered AGAIN.\n\nThis results in your Big 23-Cup unit's filter receiving ALMOST NO impurities through it's filter.\n\nAs your 10-Cup Pitcher's filter slowly clogs with impurities and degrades down to the dreaded ""006"" level...\nDO NOT DISCARD IT... just keep using it until it gets to 3 or 5 TIMES that ""impure""... which is  ""018"" to ""030""\nNote that this is STILL quite PURE.... even at this level that is3 to 5 times beyond the manufacturer-\nrecommended point of change... that water is still very pure and drinkable:  but wait... don't drink it... instead:\nPOUR that 90%+ purified water from the 10-Cup Pitcher... into the big 23-Cup Filter, and filter it again...\ndown to ""000"" (or at least well under the ""006"" level... which is 99% to 100% pure).\n\nYour filter in the big 23-Cup unit is thus always receiving water that is almost totally pure to begin with,\nso IT'S FILTER DOES NOT CLOG OR WEAR-OUT... IT LASTS FOR MONTSH AND MONTHS.\n\nWhen the Big 23-Cup unit's filter finally (after a very long time) reads ""006""... you can take that\nfilter... and PUT IT IN YOUR 10-CUP PITCHER as the new ""pre-filter""... and pop a brand-new\nZeroWater Filter into your big 23-Cup unit, and you are good-to-go again... for a very long time.\n\nThat's the whole cycle.  That's the big secret.  That's they way to get 150 to 250 GALLONS\nout of each $10 filter... rather than just 30 to 50 gallons.\n\nBuy 12 ten-dollar filters per year... or 2 to 3 ten-dollar filter per year... the choice is yours.\n\nIsn't it brilliant in its obvious simplicity?\n\nHappy Filtering!";You can make these ZeroWater Filters Last 5 times longer!
61;3.0;1.0;752.0;I was excited about this product as a replacement for the Brita pitcher I was using and was quite pleased when it first arrived and filtered as advertised. I was so happy with it that I even threw out it's predecessor after testing the water output and seeing that the Brita (which admittedly was in need of a filter change anyway) couldn't come close in filtration to it. The tap water at the time was reading 200 on the included meter and came out around 160 from the Brita and 0 with this. Goodbye Brita I found my new Pitcher! Or so I thought.\n\nLess than 3 weeks later the water developed an awful almost acidic taste to it, so I busted out the trusty meter they included and tested again. The water from the tap was at this point reading 180 impurities and after going through this filter is spiked to over 300! I dumped out the pitcher, rinsed it as well as the collection area for filtration and allowed it to filter again, I did this several times assuming the problem may have been some bad water that came through the pipes and still despite going in from tap water in the 180s was coming out over 300.\n\nNeedless to say I was none too happy, a filters ability to clean the water may degrade overtime but in no way should it be making it worse than how it went in. I e-mailed the company inquiring as to how it is possible that their filters are making the water worse and if this was normal after such light usage (less than 3 weeks from a single guy who between work and working out isn't home much especially around the holidays, and the first week I filtered water through the Brita before pouring it into the collector in this unit!). My e-mail to them could have been accusatory or demanding of a refund or new replacement filters, but it wasnt, it was simply a request for information to ascertain whether the filter may have been defective or if this was something to be expected. They never even had the decency to respond, thus I have no choice really but to assume that this is indicative of the lifespan of their filters which I'm not interested in paying for a new $15 filter every 2 weeks, further I'm so jaded I won't purchase a replacement filter on principal alone. Do yourself a favor and save your money, even a brita filter after a year of use would filter better than this would after 2 weeks, and Im sure their customer service would at least take the time to respond as well to concerns aimed at the quality of their product.;Started Contaminating the water in less than 3 weeks of use!
101;4.0;4.0;849.0;"I chose this brand of water filter after reading reviews here and also on Consumer Reports Online, of which I am a paid subscriber.  CR recommends the ZeroWater filters and Clear2O filters; unfortunately, the latter company is no longer in business.  I noted that neither Brita nor Pur were recommended, even though these two brands are probably the most widely sold/known.\n\nAlso, unlike some competing filters, the plastic pitcher of the ZW is BPA-free.\n\nPrice was in the same ballpark for the pitcher, but the filter cartridges are admittedly more expensive.\n\nSo far I have been very happy with the performance of this product.  Of course, my tap water tested at a relatively clean 75, despite the tester's geographical map claiming that my state averaged 300-400!  I suspect the tester company prefers to use the highest number for each state in order to cover their backsides.\n\nIn any case, due to the already low TDS score of my tap water, I am keeping my fingers crossed that the filters will last the claimed 25-40 gallon range.  If not, I will return it to the local store where I bought it since I made sure to keep the sales receipt.\n\nOtherwise I have had none of the problems that some reviewers are complaining about, though I have to agree that the second water does filter more slowly on the second quart (when the pitcher is half full with the first quart already filtered) but that's ok, I plan to keep a couple of glass quart bottles around for storage so that I will only need to filter one additional quart at a time.  I like the looks of the pitcher, it's ergonomically pleasant.  Haven't used the push spout because I prefer to simply pour from the top, and it works fine that way already.\n\nUPDATE 9/14/12: I have noticed that there is maybe 1/2 to 1"" of water left in the top chamber if you try to filter 2 liters at a time...if you want to get that standing water out you have to either empty at least half of the water in the pitcher or hold the filter above the water line for a few minutes for it to drain comnpletely.  This is definitely an inconvenience, but not a deal-breaker...especially since there doesn't seem to be any other pitcher filter of comparable quality on the market at the moment.  I resolved this issue by using a BPA-free gallon bottle to store the filtered water, such that the pitcher is never more than 1 quart full at the bottom, tops.  All the same, downgraded from 5 stars to 4.\n\n*** UPDATE 9/20/12: sheesh, why didn't I think of this before?  To resolve the leftover water problem detailed above, all you have to do is lift the top compartment a couple inches, rotate it so that it sits cross-wise on top of the pitcher...then you can add even more water, which will have no trouble emptying at all, and end up with a truly full pitcher of yummy clean water!  I just wish the manufacturer had included some sort of lift-tab/handle to make this easier...but I understand that some consumers would be too lazy to do this and such an admission that this adaptation is necessary, might lose too many customers.  Either way, I remain quite happy with this product, simply because there's nothing else of comparable quality on the market right now.\n\n*** UPDATE 9/22/12:  Posted a photo of what the improv method described above looks like.\n\n*** UPDATE 01/01/13:  Well, I finally decided to change the filter cartridge about 2 weeks ago after a whopping THREE MONTHS of usage, at the rate of about 1-1.5 gallons per day...this adds up to 90-135 gallons total...and the kicker is, I *DIDN'T* really need to change it, the filtered water still tasted fine and still scored a perfect ""00""...I decided to change it just to be on the safe side, and also because I wanted to test out one of the new replacement filters I had ordered from Amazon...I had bought an 8 pack in order to get the cheapest per-filter price, but had heard that some people were complaining about the replacement filters being allegedly of a different and cheaper design that didn't work nearly as smoothly as the original filter that came with the pitcher.  WRONG!  I'm happy to say that the new replacement filters were identical visually, and filter just as well as the original.  So overall, I am still a very happy customer!\n\nFrom reading a few of the other reviews, I see that some people are complaining about the pour spout on the bottom and also having spillage issues when pouring from the top.\n\n1.  The bottom pour spout is obviously just a marketing gimmick...so DON'T USE IT!  I can tell it's a poor design, such that repeated usage will cause it to leak plus it IS too slow...just take the darn pitcher out of your fridge and pour it, that's going to cost you what, an extra 5 seconds of your precious time?  Also think about the electricity you'll be saving by not having the fridge open while it's pouring 10 times a day...duh!  So, JUST PRETEND THIS SPOUT ISN'T THERE.\n\n2.  Pouring from the top DOES require patience and carefulness, more so than the Brita pitchers do...so what?  That's a small price to pay for water that's actually PROPERLY FILTERED, which I cannot say for Brita or any other cheap charcoal-based filtration systems...that's why they're so cheap!\n\nSure, it'd be great if ZeroWater figured out how to not have these two problems, but in the meantime, the fact remains: THERE IS NOTHING ELSE (i.e. pitcher filter) ON THE MARKET that filters anywhere nearly this well...so, deal with it.  Or, do what I do: buy a 1 gallon pitcher (glass if possible) and use it to keep the filtered water in the fridge...eliminates both of the above problems in one fell swoop.\n\n*** UPDATE 5/10/13 --- replaced filter, FIVE months later! Was still getting a ""002"" reading.\nWhat I learned: when installing a new filter, soak the black rubber ring that comes with it for at least 5 or 10 minutes.  I didn't do this the last time I replaced the filter, and the result was that there was some leaking from the top chamber the first time I filled it, such that I had to loosen the filter and then re-tighten it later in order to fix it.  I got this tip from reading somebody else's review, whose name I now forget...but thanks, whoever you are!  That pretty much eliminates the last remaining glitch with this Zerowater system.\n\n*** UPDATE 7/31/14 --- since relocating to an urban area with less pristine tap water quality (TDS reading of around 80) and then adding a housemate about six months ago, our water consumption has gone up to about 7-8 liters a day and the filter now needs changing once a month.  By my rough calculations that means about 240 liters (60 gallons) of quality drinking water (store bought water often scores in the TDS 50-90 range) for $9 (since I buy 8 packs of the replacement filters for about $75 from Amazon) which is still a bargain compared to buying the stuff.\n\nHope ZeroWater stays in business, because I do notice that their product is increasingly crowded off of store shelves by much cheaper but useless charcoal-filter based systems like Pur and Brita.  Oh well, it wouldn't be the first time that cheap inferior products win out---just witness the continuing dominance of McDonalds, maker of the worst fast food burger on the market (even Consumer Reports recently confirmed this!).";Very happy so far... (updated 05.10.13)
48;5.0;2.0;105.0;The main problem with the ZeroWater pitcher is the filtering cavity at the top of the pitcher is filled with soot and filter particles - and although the water filters through crystal clear - it is still quite annoying to see this every time I fill up the pitcher.  Also, we have to be careful as to not splash any of this water through the opening as it is obviously dirty with whatever makes up the filter.  I followed the directions as written to put the filter together, so I'm not sure why this is happening?;... filters through crystal clear - it is still quite annoying to see this every time I fill up the ...
37;6.0;1.0;76.0;I have various concerns with this pitcher.\n\nFirst, the filter lasted only four (yes, 4) days (with 2 adults, 1 dog and 2 cats). We do have very hard well water, but still. No way is this an affordable option. By day four the water had an awful sour taste and gave me heartburn. The TDS reading was 10 at this point. Our well water tested over 400, but never gave me heartburn. This makes me wonder what is in this filter.\n\nSecond, as I have further researched water quality, it appears that TDS (total dissolved solids) relates more to aesthetic qualities (taste, smell, etc.) and actually indicates very little about overall quality and other contaminants. ZeroWater's marketing is deceiving, suggesting that zero TDS is healthy and recommended by the FDA. I could find no such recommendation by the FDA, but did find their regulations for bottled water, which cannot exceed 500 TDS. The ZeroWater website also states that 500 TDS is the maximum allowed by the EPA. However, this article (http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/secondarystandards.cfm) on the EPA's website seems to contradict that, stating that TDS is a secondary, non-mandatory drinking water regulation. Nowhere does the ZeroWater website explicitly address the EPA's primary (i.e., mandatory) drinking water regulations. The ZeroWater website does have a chart of various pesticides and other contaminants that are apparently mostly filtered out, but the emphasis on TDS and deceptive marketing makes me skeptical.\n\nThe more I have read, the more I question the safety and efficacy of this filter. That, combined with the short life and expense of the filters, leaves me less than impressed. I am returning the pitcher for a (partial) refund (there is return shipping fee of $8.50). I cannot recommend this product.;research drinking water regulations before buying
23;7.0;2.0;57.0;"Was very excited to get this after reading reviews and using a Brita for 8+ years. Disappointed is an understatement!! We are going on one month, and Im on my second filter- and its STILL not right.\n\nFirst off, very simply, the pitcher design is poor. The pour spout is way too large. Pour too quickly, and you'll spill everywhere. You've been warned. The push- spout is a nice feature, though.\n\nWe set up our first filter and noted our tap water runs between 260-310, so slightly high. Water went down to 001. Tasted great. Thought we were money. Was very happy.\nTwo weeks later, I thought it tasted a bit funny, so I checked it again. 001. Hubby did not think it tasted funny, so maybe it was me. This was a thursday, when I was going away for the weekend, so from Thursday- Sunday, only one person was drinking water at home.\nCame back Sunday and the water tasted terrible!! ALmost like a lemony/metallic taste. Hubby noticed it as well. Tested the water- 636!!!\nSo- not only did the filter fail in just under 3 weeks, but it was DUMPING the trapped solids back into our water. Tested the tap- still 260. So, semi poisoning us. Disgusting.\n\nChanged the filter- that was this past sunday. Tasted great after changing.. Today is Thursday. Water tested at 030 this morning, FOUR DAYS into new filter. Tastes OK, but what gives?? I suppose my meter could be funky.. but  Tap water consistent, still high 200s range.\n\nThe O-rings have been in place, I've been careful of contaminants. Not sure what my issue is, but Im done buying $15 filters to ""try."" Giving it two stars because the concept is great, and I do think its a better filter than Brita, but I do not think it does whats promised. Wish I hadnt wasted the $60. As much as we strive for less plastic at home and more sustainability...

29;8.0;1.0;62.0;"Review update: Bought on November Nov 19, today is Jan 31.  When the filter turns bad, the water stinks like rotting fish.  We could not figure out the source at first, then we discovered its the boiling water.  So we back tracked the tap water, nope. Then the Seychelles water, nope. Then the ZeroWater, yup.  After 2 months of use, the filter died. My wife, son and I used this water for two days!  YUCK.\n\nWe used the test meter and it still showed the filter is fine, but the water still smells like dead fish.  Go on youtube and search on ZeroWater Smell, and see the video on ""ZeroWater Filtration System Water Dispenser! Why does my water smell like fish?? "" And there I found my answer.  In fact by googling it, you find out that many have this problem.  I will call the company tomorrow. I am so dissapointed.  The water is great up till two days ago.  This is way way way too dangerous if they can't resolve this.\n\nI purchased this because of a product comparison report at Natural news dot com. I like the tester that comes with this product.  But I do not like the lid.  It is difficult to put the lid back on.  They need to do a redesign of that aspect of the product, but the filter is superb. I use Seychelles  for taking out the radiation particals, and use this to take out all the other stuff.  Thanks to what went on in Fukushima, California's water has gone up a few Rads...\n\nSo if you are looking for the best picture filter system, Mike Adams report and lab study proves this filter. The only counter top filtration system that is better would be a Big Berkey if you have $350 to spend on it. We also use Berkey Shower filters too. So we take researching these water filter systems pretty seriously.";Recommended by Mike Adams of Natural News
7;9.0;5.0;34.0;"Some have complained their filters do not last long enough.  I believe I have a solution:\n\nWhen I was a teenager with nothing else to do, I went to the public swimming pool every day. In my boredom, I decided on an experiment: I showered after the pool, but did not wash my hair.  I discovered the chlorine left a thick, gummy residue making it nearly impossible to comb my hair. With that in mind, we fill our water filters with water from two pitchers we leave sitting out, uncovered, at least 8 hours.  This allows the chlorine in the water to evaporate before going through the filter.  Result: We bought our Zero Water pitcher in mid April 2017. Our tap water reads 050. Our filtered water still reads 000.  Today is June 25th.\n\nI will update this review whenever our filter finally needs replacing.  Meanwhile, I'm requesting other owners to try my experiment and reply to this review when you have determined if evaporating the chlorine before filling your filter pitcher makes a difference in how long your filters last. Thanks.\n\nTo respond to other complaints:\n1. The filter leaks:  My wife installed the filter. It leaked. I tightened it per the instructions and it stopped leaking. If your filter leaks, you didn't tighten it properly.\n\n2. The water takes forever to go through the filter: I noticed the top of the filter was blocked by air bubbles. I used a little thin plastic spoon to gently chase the bubbles around and make them ""pop"" through the membrane. I was very careful not to damage the membrane.  The water then drained through the filter properly.\n\n3. The carbon filter stuff is getting into the top chamber:  So what? That's pre-filter.  It is not pretty, but it does not matter.  You don't have a problem unless you have pieces of filter in the bottom chamber.  Ignore it.\n\nWe also bought the larger tank for the fridge. A full ZeroWater pitcher perfectly fills the upper chamber on the tank.  We are using the recommendations of another reviewer who runs the water through the smaller pitcher to fill the larger tank.  This extends the life of the filters.  When the filter in the tank needs replacing, he moves it to the pitcher.  That performs a pre-filtering for the newer filter in the tank, extending the life of the tank filter.  Great idea.  With that said, do not misunderstand.  Our pitcher filter has been used the most since we drink from it as well as from the tank, and we use it to fill the tank.  And yet it is still reading 000.\n\nSince you have read this far, you win a free magic trick!  We are big fans of the Carbonaro Effect, and I figured out a Carbonaro-style trick with our fridge tank.  When you are going to have company over, fill the tank to the top and when the lower chamber is full, fill the upper chamber to the top, too, and put in the fridge.  When setting the table for dinner, ask Aunt Gullible to fill the water glasses.  As she is doing so, explain how the filter fills itself by extracting the moisture from the air in the fridge, and how this helps prevent mold growth in the fridge.  After dinner, remind Aunt Gullible to check the filter to see if it is full yet.  She knows nobody has gone near the fridge, and will be astonished to see the filter is full again, or at least, refilled substantially.";The Secret of Filter Longevity
95;10.0;5.0;88.0;This is a great filter!  A neat device is the TDS (Total Disolved Solids) meter.  I bought two pitchers and one didn't work.  Electronics is my career, so I determined it was battery connections that needed to be manipulated. I'm sure it worked, prior to shipping.\n\nThe filter is rather big, as it has several stages and it will be more expensive, to replace, compared to a Brita pitcher, which is what I had been using.  The meter is fun to 'play' with as you can check your tap water and compare your other water filter to this one.  TDS is not the only thing that is important about clean water.  BUT, this filter has charcoal, which will remove bad tastes.\n\nHow your water tastes can be subjective.  This filter will remove most minerals and sometimes highly purified water, such as distilled, has a flat taste.  I didn't find that to be the case here.\n\nOne neat addition is a water tap on the front.  If you like to keep your pitcher in the refrigerator, you don't have to pull it out to get water.  Water is all I drink, so I used to carry two Brita pitchers to my bedroom at night. I have a small ice maker in the bathroom, so I have iced water through the night.  One down side is the weight of the filled pitcher.  But, you can't get highly filtered water, from a multi-stage filter, and expect the filter to be the size of a Brita filter.  Because the large filter occupies more space, the pitcher is bigger to allow for more water capacity.\n\nI live in an area with old, rusty pipes.  Rust is such a problem that I have a full house sediment filter and under the kitchen sink, I have another whole house filter, with smaller particle filtration and a carbon filter.  This then leads to a two stage filtration system employing carbon and sediment filters.  I removed the kitchen sink sprayer and installed a filter tap.  Maybe I'm nuts, but I then use this water to put into this pitcher!  I have a parrot and other birds and I just don't like the idea of drinking rust.  I'm already rusty and creaky, so I don't need more rust!\n\nWith all of that and the Brita filter, when I wiped the inside of the water bin, of the ice maker, I see rust on the paper towels!  This is after a large volume of water, over time, but it still disturbs me.  Maybe that comes with being a highly analytical engineer!  Or, a big part is when I added the whole house filter.  I had to remove a section of galvanized pipe and needed to replace it with PVC.  I looked inside of the metal pipe, in place since 1971 and I was horrified by what I saw.  There was something black inside of the pipe.  I stuck my finger in and it was covered with a black goo!  There was so much that the inside diameter, of the pipe, was reduced by 50%!\n\nPerhaps you know understand my obsession with water filtration.  I replaced the pipe leading to the underside of the sink filtraction system, but I know that when I shower, some of that goo is getting on me.  Yuck!  I had wondered why a black mold looking substance would form in the toilet.  I really need to find out what it is.  But, I'm not allowed to put in a well and I can't force them to replace all of their pipes.  Unfortunately, I can't afford to have all of mine replaced either!\n\nWell, I sure covered water filtration!  I recommend that everyone should have a whole house filter.  I plumbed mine so I can have a sediment filter and a carbon filter after that.  I also suggest that you do as I'm about to.  Send off a sample of your tap water to have it tested.  If you do put in a whole house filter, or you just use this pitcher, I would have the filtered water also tested, out of curiosity.\n\nA final word.  The less filtered the water going into this pitcher, the faster the filter will need replacing.  If you use a clear whole house filter housing (highly recommended) you can see what is being kept from going into your body and you can tell when to replace the filte.  Another final word!  Remember that filters filter water!  So, all the water, that passes through a filter, goes through a filter with all this yucky stuff in it.  So, don't be stingy about changing filters.  Your meter will help give you an idea when to change your filter.  It is a great tool and a fantastic marketing device!;Great, but it has a large filter making....
77;11.0;1.0;76.0;"My family used ZeroWater filters for several months. The water began to taste funny to us. I took it to a laboratory that is certified by our state to test drinking water. They found that our ZeroWater filter changed the PH level of the water to 5.64  from our original city drinking water of a PH of 7.9. That is 100 times more acidic. Even pool water is treated to stay around 7.5 on the PH scale!  After learning of this PH issue, I did more research on healthy drinking water. The EPA secondary standards for pH of drinking water are 6.5 to 8.5. Additionally I found that some 21 mineral elements are known or suspected to be essential for human health. The ZeroWater may be filtering these good minerals out when it is taking out TDS. My 6 yr old child was diagnosed with gastric reflux after we used this water for several months despite never having any significant stomach problems before in her life and a very healthy eater. Coincidence?\nI would like to add some clarification to my review. The filtered ZeroWater that I had professionally tested was from a working filter. I checked the TDS with the tester provided by the company before submitting the sample and the TDS was 000. So this filter was working and I was vigilant about changing our filter regularly over the several months we drank this as the water taste clearly worsened when the filter was in need of change. By the way, the laboratory charged me $15 for this test so if you are wondering about your own ZeroWater, it is a small fee to have it checked professionally. The lab even checked it a 2nd time on their own time because they just wanted ""to make sure"" - I think they were quite surprised. Before I went to the professional lab, I asked a local pool supply store to test as they do it for free. They couldn't give an exact PH with their equipment but they could clearly tell the PH dropped substantially in contrast to my city drinking water. The ZeroWater came in below what they recommended for pool water. So if you don't want to pay a professional lab for an exact PH, try a pool supply store.";Turns water ACIDIC.  PH became 5.64 - that is 100 times more acidic than most drinking water
93;12.0;1.0;74.0;This is the 2nd pitcher i've owned and used (i had the smaller one prior to this). I've been totally displeased with BOTH of their products. I don't know if their design team is just lazy or if they never let any consumers test these before finalizing the design but these things have MAJOR flaws.\n\nI'm a former britta customer, and while britta occasionally gets a dud, they are FAR better designed.\n\nFirst off, there is a spiggot on the bottom that lets you get water from it without taking it out of the fridge. Ok cool idea, but it's soooo slow. I swear it can take up to a minute to fill a large cup (i use 24 oz cups as I like to drink a lot of water). I don't like standing in my fridge letting all the cold air out while i wiat for this thing to trickle into my cup. Now it is true this sized container is a bit faster/more flowing than the smaller one, which was VERY bad. But I almost never use this feature as I didn't on the smaller one either. Neat idea, but but poor execution. Not to mention when we got our container it was missing a PART in there! we took the part out of the smaller one and it works in this one...\n\nsecondly, pouring from the top is better than the smaller version of this pitcher, but as someone else stated it leaks ALL over, it comes out the sides and almost always spills down the sides of the cup your pouring into, and I use WIDE mouth cups.. Seriously? did they EVER POUR THIS THING ONE TIME IN LAB TESTS?! I asume it's becuase i'm trying to pour faster and they probably expect you to barely tip it into the glass pouring slowly and take forever to fill it, as with the smaller pitcher which is painfully slow to fill a glass , that pitchers problem is becuase there is not enough air flow, if you push the spiggot while pouring on the smaller one, it pours much faster like a britta. On this one you don't have to push the spiggot button, but if you tilt it more you get more water flow and eventually it just comes out all over the place.. So pour slowly and cautiously or make a mess..... FAIL ZERO! FAIL!\n\nalso when pouring, if you're getting down in your water (if a few people in your family are using this and not refiling sometimes, it will happen occasionally) Or if you are just filling a very large container like a camel back or nalgene and you're trying to get the last of the water, you'll have to tilt the container a bit more to get all the water, almost having it completely level, but not quite, as you do this the resevior starts to FALL out as you're pouring.. yeah it falls out of the container. I swear monkeys designed this thing.. 0 DESIGN SENSE! FAIL AGAIN! The resvior should NOT fall out if i'm trying to get the last few ounces of water!!!\n\nLastly the top lid is a pain to get on, becuase of the way its designed its a thin lip of plastic over a similarly thin lip of plastic and its a fairly tight fight.. not snug, but it's precicsely made to fit around it so sometimes you have to fumble the lid about the top of it to get it to kind of 'latch' into place.. thats not as big of a problem as the rest, but it's still a pain..\n\nas a suggestion, i think they should make the rear part (near the handle) of the resovior a little more deep than the front part, often when filling, the sink nozzle is near the front of the resvoir and as you hold this by the handle, you naturally don't have it level and so the tip end of the resevior fills up faster and you don't get as much water into it before it starts to overflow (which by the way goes RIGHT into the hole you pour from if your not careful now you've tainted your clean water... Again.. BAD DESIGN!\n\nthe water quality tastes okay. The product seems to do as advertised so i cannot say anything negative about the cleaning factor of the filter or the taste of the water, but the containers themselves are just garbage incomparison to a britta.\n\nTry again Zero, and this time send me your prototype before you approve it, i'll tell you EXACTLY what you need to fix.;Zero Water pitchers are POORLY designed.
103;13.0;4.0;78.0;My family consumes fair amount of liquid on any given day between four of us: water, juices, etc. We are always in a hurry, so, as you can understand, having no filtration system all of a sudden was not much of fun. The process is easy - push a button, get some water, and be on the way. Pitcher's filter obviously is not as fast as a build-in systems but there are some features that do simplify the process - upper tray: it's pretty convenient - just pull a kitchen hose, fill the top tray with water, and let it sit alone while you take care of other stuff. Come back later and boom! Your water is filtered and ready for consumption. Water delivery can happen two ways - through the traditional over-the-top and build-in water valve (great for convenience).\nIt's an easy yet safe enough task even for kids. The valve is tough enough to prevent our little guys to make a little lake on the middle of the kitchen yet soft enough to keep it from turning it into a workout routine. Right size and nicely designed handle design makes it easy to operate even when it's completely full.\n\nTo my complete surprise the pitcher came with a water tester. The filter needs to be changed when this tester reads 005. Just for giggles - the bottled water reads 012. It was actually really weird to realize that I'm drinking cleaner water I just filtered and there is no aftertaste.\nBut let me talk a little bit about maintenance. We obviously haven't had a chance to replace the filter yet, but the installation was really easy. (No PHD is needed to do that!)\n\nFew things though - the filter lid (circle on the middle) sometimes falls off if the stream of water is too strong and it gets a bit messy with the particles coming out of the filter. Also it sometimes gets stuck, so I normally check up to see if the water is still there in a little bit (knock lightly on the lid to make it work again);Decent for the money
97;14.0;1.0;66.0;"I tried to like ZEROWATER 10 cup pitcher. I really did. I wanted to like it so bad that I was willing to overlook the poorly designed pour spout that drips water everywhere, every time you pour. I was willing to over look the poorly designed reservoir that always held a few tablespoons of water which did not drain into the filter. I even overlooked the first filter that water wouldn't flow through. I overlooked being told (in a rather condescending way) that some filters had to be ""burped"", AFTER you poke holes in the top. After three more filters that would not drain properly and three that drained OK but only lasted 10 days until the dreaded ""6"" showed up on the meter, by the way, no need to use the meter, your water WILL taste pungent at best when it hits 5 I finally returned everything and went with another manufacturer's product which in the interest of not being called a lackey for that company will remain nameless.";Bad Design
24;15.0;1.0;37.0;"I purchased this product the last week of March, 2016 - 6 weeks ago. I was away from home for 3 weeks of that time period. I live alone and drink, on average 1 pitcher/day.\n\n3 days ago I tested the water and it read 127ppm. My tap water is 250+ppm. Yesterday, upon placing the pitcher on the counter, the front of the pitcher cracked and water started leaking out. Mind you, I had Brita pitcher for 3+ years, and more recently a Pur filter for 4 years - they NEVER cracked. I called customer support to find out if something was wrong and if I could get a replacement filter. I had to leave a message - no answer.\n\n3 days after I leave my message to customer service, I receive a phone call from a ZeroWater representative. I tell her all of the above information and her response is, ""That is the correct amount of time for the filter to work. You will only get 12-15 gallons out of each filter."" Ok - I say - and what about the cracked pitcher? This seems to be poor construction or cheap materials. ""Thanks for the feedback"", she replies. Ok - I say - is there a way to solve this problem? It seems I paid $35 for a one-month supply of water... ""You can buy a new pitcher"", she says. I then tell her that I'm not feeling very cared for as a customer. Her reply, ""I'll pass on that information to the powers that be.""\n\nAnd that was the end of the conversation.\n\nNeedless to say, I WILL NOT be buying anything from this company ever again. $35 for one-month supply of water is outrageous. And the customer service from beginning to end was the worst I've experienced. Spend your money on companies that take pride in what they make and back it up with decent customer service!";Shoddy product and awful customer service
1;16.0;1.0;6.0;Research sour or tart taste in zero water filter. There's a lot of good info. Some folks who are versed in chemistry have taken the time to post reviews/complaints about the ion imbalance that will occur quickly with the filter resulting in sour water. You are likely to not get nearly 10 gallons of water per filter before this occurs. Making this ridiculously expensive water. They should be ashamed of themselves and redesign the product. Plus, zero mineral or salts in your water is not healthy to begin with.;Do Not Buy! You're welcome
2;17.0;1.0;6.0;Piece of junk, rough edges everywhere, amazingly poorly made, tried to attach the filter for two hours without success, thought I got a defective unit and ordered replacement, the second ones so much easier, took me only several mins to assemble, just as I happily started to filter my first jug of zero water, I noticed the filter leaks, the blue ring won't seal no matter how tightly I screw this darn thing!;just as I happily started to filter my first jug of zero water
6;18.0;1.0;19.0;I bought this as an upgrade from a Britta based on the claims of cleaner water.  I've only had it for a couple of days so these are initial thoughts on the product.  I can't speak to filter longevity yet.\n\nThe engineering needs work - a lot of work.  The first thing I noticed right out of the box that I didn't realize from the pictures online is that it doesn't have a flip up lid like the Britta for filling.  You have to pry off the entire top. (Really!?)  I find it easiest to lift the flapper over the spout (which is way too wide and lets way too much water out - I guarantee your first pour ends up all over the floor) so I can get leverage to pry the top off.  This is very annoying and makes fill up a real chore.  Another annoyance is where different pieces of plastic meet around the handle.  None of the edges are smoothed down and the thing is very uncomfortable to carry from the sink to the fridge when full.  The sharp plastic edges all the way up the handle can be sanded down I guess, but when paying this kind of money, I shouldn't have to.  Also, This thing is TALL.  It is taller than a Britta and taller than any jug of anything you would ever have in your fridge.  To accommodate this, I had to re-arrange shelves in the fridge and now I have a lot of wasted space.\n\nThe only neat feature is the spigot on the bottom of the handle.  At least I don't have to cut my hand on the handle every time I fill a glass - only when refilling the pitcher.  Although the spigot flow is super slow and many other reviews say it fails in no time.\n\nI am going to give it a chance as I bought a 2 pack of filters (in addition to the one I didn't realize it came with).  However, I am not getting rid of the Britta.;Very Poor Engineering.
41;19.0;1.0;41.0;"Have been using for about 2 years. Filtration of dissolved solids is effective. Problems I have with it are, (1) total cost of ownership is expensive, as filters cost around $12-$15 per filter (depending on quantities purchased), and last about 2 months when the pitcher is completely filled roughly every other day; (2) TDS meter batteries died after about 1 year of use, and replacement batteries were hard to find and expensive - 3 batteries at $4 each; (3) recently filters have been releasing filtering material into the water filling bin (see photo). The photo quality may not display the material clearly, but there is both black carbon material and small yellow balls with a gelatanous feel to the touch. Customer support was indifferent about the issue, first stating that ""During shipping some of this carbon has been getting knocked loose"". Upon being pressed further at the worsening problem and the fact that more than carbon material was releasing, the response became ""This is a common thing for it to keep happening"". Even though I was recommended to simply continue using after wiping away the released material, I felt I could not do that as when you pour water out of the pitcher there is the risk of the material pouring out because small amounts of water remain in the filling bin, which can cause material to flow out into your recepticle. I don't really want the hassle of having to wipe it out before and after every use. It also means that the life-span of the filter will reduce proportionately faster. The lame response from customer support cemented the one-star rating.";Water filters are releasing filtering material into the water filling bin
13;20.0;1.0;24.0;Purchased this after much research.  Was concerned about the Chromium 6 in our water and it was the only filtered pitcher that removes it.  Was concerned about the negative comments but thought we'd give it a try.  Well at first it was fine, but after only 3 weeks, there is a metallic taste to the water.  The reading is still only 0, so it is really strange.  It is undrinkable.  Starting feeling sick a week ago, now after reading many of the comments, I see it is related to the water from this pitcher.  I will not get another filter, I believe it is the filter that is making the water taste like that.  Do yourself a favor, do not buy this ZeroWater Pitcher.  If you google, acidic, metallic taste from ZeroWater Pitchers, you will see many more negative results!  Wish I had done that first before purchasing it!!;Well at first it was fine, but after only 3 weeks
90;21.0;1.0;47.0;As others have pointed out. This water filter works extremely well for the first few weeks, then it just stops working and all you get is bitter tasting, often times smelly water. If you can afford to buy a new filter for this thing every few weeks (and for most people it seems to be around 2-3 weeks) then yeah its perfect but otherwise I wouldn't recommend this at all.;Works well for a few weeks, then all you get is bitter, disgusting water.
27;22.0;5.0;30.0;Just received this and started using it. Our family loves this filter so far. Using the handy measuring device (about the size and shape of a digital thermometer), we can see that our tap water has 177 ppm total dissolved solids, Brita-filtered water has 118 ppm (some of this being ostensibly *added* aluminum, according to analysis at Natural News Forensic Food Labs (...), and ZeroWater-filtered water has 000 ppm. (Measurements were done in identical glasses, all washed in the same load in the same dishwasher.) The ZeroWater-filtered water tastes distinctly better, almost sweet. It's surprising that we can actually taste a difference.\n\nGetting the black rubber O-ring positioned properly was a no-brainer. Straight out of the plastic bag that it comes in, the filter was quite large (twice the size of a Brita filter) and the O-ring was askew and would've been crushed if I hadn't moved it out of the way of the filter threads (see photos). After twisting the filter into the round hole of the top reservoir, I was a little concerned about a slow bubbling that I saw coming out of the side joint. Apparently this didn't affect the water quality, though.;excellent quality water at a reasonable price
16;23.0;1.0;22.0;Actually makes tap water taste worst! After awhile the filter will go bad and have a funky fish smell. If you boil the water your whole house will smell like fish.

Rather than use this I just started drinking the tap water...and it was better than this product!!!;Actually makes tap water taste worst! After awhile the filter will go bad and ...
84;24.0;5.0;43.0;My tap water reads between 50 and 70 on the meter. I have used the pitcher to filter a gallon of water per day, for 4 months now, and it just started reading at 1. You don't have to replace the cartridge until it reads 6, but I was getting impatient, and wanted to try my water purifier test dye to see how well this filter was actually filtering. The dye is between 1 and 2 microns, and none of it passed through this used zero water filter cartridge. All other filters I have tried this dye on have failed, except for my First Need Water Purifier. This pitcher is the best on the market. It has definitely exceeded my expectations. The people who have complained about a bad taste, either have really dirty refrigerators, or are working for a company making inferior water pitchers. I have found zero-water to have no taste at all. I highly recommended these pitchers.;DYE TEST AT 4 MONTHS  A+++++
63;25.0;1.0;37.0;This review is about the design. For water taste, I would give five stars.\n\nThere is a HUGE design flaw, however, in that if there is any (AT ALL) water in the top, when you go to pour from the pitcher, the water in top pours first. The simple solution, you might say, would be to use the bottom spout. The problem with that, however, is that unless the pitcher is tippy-top full, the bottom spout is slow, slow, slow.\n\nWould neither recommend nor purchase this design again.;Meh
10;26.0;3.0;15.0;I've owned this one as well as the 8 cup version. ZeroWater tastes better than Brita by far, and the filter lasts for longer than advertised if you're drawing water from a good-quality municipal source.\n\nHowever, the Achilles heel in both cases was the spout, which in principle is a good idea. On the 8 cup version, the flow rate was frustratingly slow, making me eventually give up on using the feature. On this one the flow rate was more acceptable, but still too slow if the water level is low. After a little less than two years of use, the spout button popped out due to a broken plastic piece. The spout failed open, so the pitcher is now unusable even just to pour.;Great quality water, but the spout design needs improvement
60;27.0;1.0;30.0;We ordered this unit to get good tasting clean water.  I measured our tap water and it registered over 500 on the meter supplied by ZeroWater with the unit.  The first couple of days that we used this unit the water tasted good and it registered 000 on the meter after going through the ZeroWater filter. Less than twelve days later and the water was tasting so foul that we could not drink it.  I tested the water with the meter and it registered under 20 but was so bad tasting that it was undrinkable.  Prior to getting the ZeroWater unit, we had been buying our water from a local water store (that registered a mere 002 on the meter that was supplied with the ZeroWater unit) and only cost us 25 cents a gallon.  We do not drink that much water and I estimate that we put about 15 gallons of water through the unit in the less than 2 weeks that we were able to drink the water.  Considering that replacement filters run about $17 each, that means that water through this unit was costing us over a dollar a gallon!\nNeedless to say, we are scrapping the ZeroWater and going back to a water cooler and bottled water at just 25 cents a gallon.  Our last water cooler unit lasted well over ten years.  Everything considered, the water cooler route is less expensive and tastes a whole lot better.;Bad tasting water after 2 weeks
67;28.0;5.0;30.0;I paid for testing (mass spec, atomic emission spectrophotometry, chromatography, etc.) of water prior to and subsequent to filtering with the ZeroWater filter.  The tests measured 225 contaminants (metals, non-metal inorganics, organics).  The filter took out everything measured, including Fluoride, and didn't introduce any other ions or organics.\n\nZeroWater, to me, seems the best I've found for pitchers or office water bottle systems.;Great filter
21;29.0;1.0;17.0;I bought this based off the stellar reviews.  I should have kept on looking because after owning this for just under 2 months, I am no longer happy with it.\n\nI have owned a Brita filter pitcher before and a Clear2O water pitcher.  The brita did ok, but didn't taste that great and the carbon would end up floating around in the top and sometimes in my water which I didn't like.  The Clear2O worked great for me, but I didn't like how it hooked up directly to the faucet.  I could handle it, but my girlfriend hated it.  When we moved to a new place, the current kitchen sink wouldn't hook up to it, so it was time to search for a new pitcher.\n\nI had heard good things about the ZeroWater, with the exception of the costly filters but decided to give it a try.\n\nFirst impressions were that it was very slow to filter compared to the Brita or Clear2O.  However, I liked the taste of the water and it was something I could live it.  The TDS meter was a nice gimmick.  my tap water was about 120ppm and after the filter it was down to zero, so that was good.\n\nIt's only me and her using it and her 2 cats for their water dish, and after about 2 weeks I noticed that sometimes the water would just stop filtering. It would just hang out on top until I bumped it just right and then it would continue to filter.  It was around 4 weeks when I noticed little orange spheres in the top similar to the black carbon I'd seen in my brita, but I washed those out and thought nothing of it...still reading 0ppm on the TDS so it's still working.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago, my girlfriend said the water tasted funny, and there were more orange things in the top of the filter.  Again, I checked the TDS and now it was 1ppm...well, it had taken 1.5 months to get to 1ppm, so I surely had some life left...last week, I checked again, still at 1ppm.\n\nToday the water tasted really funny.  Out of the pitcher when it's cold, it wasn't too noticeable, just a slightly sour taste to the water, again more orange stuff in the top.  I tested the TDS this time and it jumped to 82PPM in the past week!  That was crazy.  As the water warmed up, the taste just grew worse and worse, until the tap water actually tasted better than the filtered water.\n\nAt this time, I went back to amazon in search of a new filter, thinking it had been two months and was probably due for a replacement.  That's when I looked at reviews for the filters-apparently, around 2013 or so, they changed filter styles which decreased how long the filters lasted and many people have problems with the same orange things floating in the top of the pitcher.  There's a ton of bad reviews in there, but the old amazing reviews are keeping them out of sight so someone like me didn't really notice them at all.\n\nI placed an order for a new filter, but immediately cancelled it.  I'm trying another pitcher this time, from a different brand (Mavea) and hopefully that will be better...otherwise it's back to the drawing board.;Filter goes bad too quickly and leaves water with nasty taste
40;30.0;1.0;22.0;I thought buying this pitcher and filter system would help me cut down on unnecessary bottled water use. It did at first until about 3 weeks into using the Zerowater pitcher and system , it seemed to completely stop filtering and began to emit a lemon like and fish like taste and smell. If you read the reviews on this link\n\nhttp://zerowater.pissedconsumer.com/zero-water-dangerous-20120522319913.html\n\nYou will see that many of people have experienced the same thing. The water here in Tampa isn't great. But after watching the filter begin to polute the water rather than filter it i feel scared to even drink from it. Buy a pur and avoid this nearly $40 headache. It literally gives you a headache because of the metallic and carbon pollutants it begins to expel into the water. Don't buy this over expensive to good to be true water system.;Buyerss Beware.
11;31.0;5.0;13.0;Sorry, for the super long review. Here is a short summary and if you want to read the entire life story of my water filter you are welcome to it below:\nPros:\nHigh quality filters that work really, really well\nThe pitcher design is well thought out\nOnly change filters about once every 6 months\n\nCons:\nExpensive filters\nHave to change the filter immediately after the meter reads 006 (about every 6 months)\nRough edges on pitcher\nThe push to dispense spout is a joke\n\nThis filter is pretty darn good. Before I purchased it I found several independent studies on the internet, including one done by my alma mater, that all agreed that Zerowater is the best pitcher water filter out there. Now that doesnt mean this is a super filter or anything like that. It is designed to take clean, potable water and remove any remaining impurities. It is not designed to filter dirty or contaminated water, you will clog your filter. There are other, very good, filtration systems out there designed for applications like that.\n\nOne of the things I really like about the design of this filter is that the filter actually screws into the top of the pitcher and there is a rubber O-ring that makes sure you have a tight seal. The O-ring is part of the filter assembly, a new one comes with each filter, so you don't even need to worry about the O-ring wearing out over time. This design ensures that all the water from the top reservoir has to go through the filter before going into the main body of the pitcher (bottom reservoir) where you can pour it out. This is one of the main reasons why I switched from Britta to Zerowater. I took a look at how my Britta filter was working and I noticed that only about half of the water was going through the filter. The other half was actually going around it into the bottom reservoir. Since the filter on a Britta is a drop in design, the size of the filter has to match the size of the hole in the pitcher exactly. If not, water will flow around the filter and not much will go through. I threw away that filter and tried a new one, same problem. So, I started looking for a better designed water pitcher.\n\nI have owned and used this Zerowater pitcher for two years, and I definitely think it is the best. Yes, the filters are expensive, especially compared to Brita filters, but with my tap water and usage level, I only need to change filters about once every 6 months. For the performance, and the fact that Britta filters are supposed to be changed every 2 months, I find that pretty reasonable. Your mileage may vary depending on how bad your tap water is and how much water your family uses.\n\nThe one bad thing about this filter, when the reading reaches 006 on the included meter, change the filter as soon as possible. Not because that level of minerals in the water is suddenly dangerous, but because, in my experience, it is the first sign that the filter is starting to go bad. And when the filter goes bad, it does so quickly. Taking regular readings, it is my experience that the meter reads 000 for the first 3-4 months, climbs to 003 in month 5, and 006 in month 6. After it reaches 006, I only have maybe two weeks to change the filter before the water starts to smell fishy. And I mean that literally, like fish. It starts off very subtle at first, but it will get stronger and stronger. I don't know if it comes from some chemical from the filter leaching into the water or if it is from some sort of bacterial contamination in the filter but to avoid it, change the filter immediately when the meter reads 006.\n\nOn fit and finish, when I first got the pitcher there were a lot of rough edges in the plastic, especially on the handle. That was weird and slightly annoying, you would think that for a premium water pitcher they would pay more attention to something like that.  Also, the push to dispense spout at the bottom of the handle is a joke. You only get a trickle of water out of it. Youll be standing there for 5 minutes waiting for your cup to fill up or you can just pick up the pitcher and pour the water in 5 seconds. Needless to say, I have always just used the pour spout;The best but not perfect
15;32.0;1.0;14.0;Water filer started giving bitter water in just one week. After that I replaced water filer - again it started giving bitter water. Not happy with this product.;Not happy with this product
20;33.0;1.0;14.0;Very disappointed! I live in Los Angeles and have been a Brita user for many years. At first, this seemed like a good product - water tested very low in TDS compared to our tap water (004 vs 250) and tasted great. Even if it does filter water very slowly (compared to a Brita), we were still happy with this filter for the first two weeks. Then around the third week, we began to notice golden/yellow and black flecks appearing in the water reservoir, and the water began to have a slight lemony, almost sour aftertaste. I washed the pitcher, and even ran water from a Brita filter into the reservoir before drinking it and decided to give it a few more days since the TDS reading was still 004. We are now a few days past our 30 day warranty, and now the water tastes almost metallic and has a reading of 016.\n\nI just called ZeroWater, and they tell me the yellow flecks are Ions releasing into the reservoir which occurs when filling the reservoir with aerated water direct from the tap. Well, like I described earlier, Ive actually been putting my tap water through a Brita pitcher first and then filling the ZeroWater reservoir. ZeroWater has said for this reason they will replace my filter since the Ions should not be occurring. However, as for the lemony taste, they tell me based on my tap water reading of 250, I can only expect my filter to last for about 15-20 gallons total of water and that this is explicitly stated in the information on filter durability in and on the box. Well, on the box it says 15 gallons and in the information booklet from inside the box it says Service flow rate is 2.5 gallons per day. DO the MATH ZEROWATER!! If any household kept to the 2.5 gallons a day flow rate that would mean our filters will only optimally last 6 days until it reaches the 15 gallon service life. Throw in a majority of the population who lives in over populated urban environments with intricate, if not old and already contaminated, water infrastructure, and you get a totally useless product! (Note to consumers: unless you read through all the small print, this is one of the very last statements made in the info sheet that comes in the box, or the one of the last lines actually on the box, but to be fair to consumers it should be spelled out how little these filters are actually meant to last if you live in an area with high TDS).\n\nWhile, yes, LA water is bad #1) the filter should not deteriorate in its capacity that quickly (let's not forget how expensive these filters are), #2) even if the filter loses its effectiveness overtime (as is expected) in filtering out TDS, it should not begin to give off a sour aftertaste only after 3 weeks of use (even Brita filters don't do that and they filter very little contaminants out!), and #3) ZeroWater knowingly only gives a 30-day warranty when a vast majority of consumers needing such a product live in urban areas with poor TDS rating water, and without question these consumers will get Ion flecks and will only be able to use their filters for at least 2-3 weeks before realizing that the filter has lost its effectiveness and the water tastes poorly. And #4) upon stating the obvious unfair 30-day warranty on the filter and overall dissatisfaction with the product, ZeroWater said I could not return the product or get my money back, and generally did not at all seemed that concerned that I plan on never wasting money on a ZeroWater filter again.;Very disappointed! A waste of money if you live in an urban area! Filters only last 6-15 days!
79;34.0;4.0;25.0;**UPDATE 2/11/15**\nI finally changed out the filter a week ago with a 006 reading. I measured the water and it was 72ppm. So, my original range still held true, and after 21 months of use it was time to swap it out for a new one. One of the best investments ever. Container still in great condition and everything works fine.\n\nNote: When you first install and use a new filter, it'll show a reading on the meter in the newly filtered water. Mine read 004, but after a few rounds it decreased to 000ppm.\n===============================================\n\nI'm writing this after four months of use, drinking 32-64 ounces (up to 2000 mL) of water per day. My tap water measures between 30-85 ppm, according to the tester, which is really cool by the way! So far, the filtered water still measures at ZERO ppm. The water tastes great and at this point, seems everlasting. I know some people have measured their tap water to be above 200-300 ppm, and I can see how the filter wouldn't last as long. The filter has a 5-step system, which is one reason as to why the water takes so long to make it's way through. I wouldn't recommend this for families, as I could see how it would be a bit annoying to constantly have to fill the water and never really being able to get it ice cold before it's all gone. Vicious cycle. I'm a single man, so it doesn't bother me at all.\n\nRegarding the design:\nI have never once had an issue with the water leaking from around the lid. It fits secure. Yes, you need to be a bit careful when pouring so that it doesn't just flow everywhere. The slightest amount of patience goes a long way. I use the small-mouth Nalgene bottle and pour it over the sink just to be even more careful. In case you were wondering why I gave it four stars, the little spout on the bottom has given me some issues. My first pitcher's spout broke when depressed, but I exchanged it with no questions asked. Second pitcher has been perfect, so it must have been a fluke for me. Secondly, it just takes too long to pour. As I said, I use a 32-ounce Nalgene bottle and I just don't like to wait that long.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this when looking for a pitcher with a filtration system. Maybe not to larger families, unless there's a bigger version with greater volume. The water tastes great and it's designed relatively well. Granted, I haven't used any other makes or models, but I am 90% happy with my purchase and I would do it all over again if I had to.\n\nP.S. I bought mine from CostCo, which came with an extra filter. Cheaper long-term decision over Amazon. And for what it's worth, I never leave product reviews, but I think ZeroWater makes a great product here.\n\nUpdate 11/20/13\nAfter 11 months the water still reads 0 ppm with tap water reading consistently between 35-85 ppm. Everything has held up perfectly. Saved a lot of money over store bought bottles.\n\nUpdate 2/22/14\nStill on the original filter and water reads 0 ppm. The tap still reads between 35-85 ppm. Savings on buying water have been immeasurable, from time to money.;Works for me!
17;35.0;1.0;13.0;After I used this filter for exactly 10 days, the water acquired an acute sour taste.

Best-selling author Olivia Black did the taste test. It was awesome. Thought all my water filtration dreams had just come true. She loved the taste, and we thought we'd be set for at least a month before we had to change the pricey $15-$18 filter.\n\nBut two weeks later, my total dissolved solids (TDS) went from .000 to OVER .999! I was drinking some kind of nasty sludge without knowing it after only two weeks! Apparently, this filter releases something (or everything) after it wears for a while. We calculated about 284 ounces (a bit over two gallons) went through this over two weeks before the kids began complaining that the water tasting sour. We thought our son put lemon juice in it. I tested the water on a whim and found the TDS were off the charts. Our normal tap water ranges from about .380/PPM to .500/PPM, which is pretty nasty to begin with. Apparently, when the filter breaks down, it may release the junk it collected. Nasty. The final reading went to .998, .999, and the meter displayed --- which means it cannot display how bad my water had become.\n\nGranted, the folks at ZeroWater admit that if your water is bad like ours, their filters won't last long. They advise changing the filter at .006, which seems a little early. There must be a reason for this; perhaps the breakdown accelerates soon after the .006 benchmark.\n\nI've got a bit more life from subsequent filters by using my refrigerator filter first, then using that water in the ZeroWater filtration system. That seems to work a bit better.\n\nNow, the ""five stage"" filtration claim is a little tricky. I took a filter apart. Here are the five stages, and they look nothing like the graphic ZeroWater uses. Photos at [...]\n\n1. Plastic mesh\n2. About 1/2"" of charcoal\n3. A collection of about a half pound of mysterious tiny yellow gel balls\n4. A thin slab that resembles a cotton pad\n5. One more smaller plastic mesh\n\nI was hoping for something a bit more scientific, I suppose. Perhaps the tiny yellow gel balls are the magical substance that removes all the TDS from the water. Hey - it works. For a while, anyway.\n\nBottom line: when the water is good, it's really good. But with my nasty tap water, I'm afraid this solution may not be economical for us.";Clean as a whistle, tastes better than tap. But for less than two weeks.
5;37.0;1.0;8.0;Don't buy this! After less than a month of use, the water in the pitcher either smells like rotting fish or gets super acidic and tastes like lemon. I have changed the filter multiple times and it keeps happening with each new filter. I have no idea what causes the smell or taste, but it can't be good. Going back to a Brita filter instead.;Rotting fish water
76;38.0;3.0;22.0;I purchased this product after doing research on different water systems.  I had used Britta for several years and noticed that after changing the filter, the water tasted like chlorine only days later.  I decided to purchase Zero Water after learning that it could filter out most dissolved solids and that the container is BVP free.\nAt first the water was terrific!  I hadnt tasted water this clean since childhood. My cousin and I used the indicator to test our water and, l like the ad says, the meter showed a 000 when my tap water, which scored 265 right out of the faucet, was filtered.  I was impressed.  But after 12 days, I noticed what looked like charcoal residue in the reservoir  this didn't concern me because my Britta had done the same.  But what did concern me were the flecks of metallic gold material that accompanied it.\nAfter only 18 days of use, we noticed that our water had a sour, almost lemony taste, as if somebody had accidentally spilled a small amount of lemonade drink crystals into the pitcher.  I washed it as instructed but the taste didn't go awaythen I tested the filtered water from the pitcher, and it scored a 598!!!!!!  Obviously, the filter was spilling some sort of chemical substance into the water, rendering it more polluted than the water from my tap!  (If anybody reading this had a similar problem please write me!!!)\nI write this on a Sunday, and the Zero Water Hotline is closed.  When I speak to them, I may update this review.  Probably the filter needs to be changed: if so, for the price they charge for them, it should have last far longer than a mere 18 days.  I do not live in a large household: there are only 3 adults living in my home  so it isn't as though a family of 10 is using one filter.;Still on the fench

4;40.0;1.0;6.0;The filters for this product don't last long, even though I have a very intense whole house filter, with special filter in the kitchen area.  Also, when using their filter the top container ends up with TONS of black flecks, bigger then pepper, some small some huge, and floating like black garbage in the water waiting to go through the filter.  When I called about this they said it was carbon from the carbon filter used for this product backing up and supposedly was no problem!  It sure looks awful and I need to clean out the top area every time I add water!!  Even after cleaning I don't get out all the black particles!  So, will use up the 8 filters I purchased and then get rid of this thing.;Not so clean!
73;41.0;1.0;21.0;I have well water and the tester rated it at 590 so I knew I would go thru filters faster than someone who reads at say 200, but I think I filled this maybe 8-9 times over the week and a half I have owned it.  I use it mainly for coffee and drinking water and the other day coffee tasted odd but I also put creme and sugar in it. Yesterday my daughter poured a glass of water that she said was horrible spit it right out, I had a glass of water last night and spit it right back into the glass.\n\nThere is a horrible taste can't quite pinpoint what it is but not clean, even emptied the pitcher and got a clean glass same taste, having only filled this a few times if my filter is already shot this is going to be way more expensive than bottled water.\n\nThe odd part is when I test the water it's coming out at 4 (still under the 6 mark where they say to replace the filter), but again with less than 10 fills and it tasting this bad so soon I don't know what to do except buy more bottled water from the store again.\n\nI have to say the first few pitchers we were all drinking the water and loving it, I tested all my sources the tap was 590, my filter on the faucet (pur) read 476, the filter on my fridge read 450, and my new zerowater pitcher was reading 2 so I thought ok this is awesome but how quickly my praises have changed since the taste is horrible after only a few fills wish I didn't toss the box so fast cuz this would be going back to Amazon $30 wasted :(;First week AMAZING now YUCKY TASTE :(
8;42.0;1.0;8.0;Put in a brand new filter in the pitcher early evening yesterday. Filled up the water, and it sat in the reservoir all night. It was still filled to the top when I checked it 11am. This happens too many times, and it is a real pain. I beat the filter on the counter, and still clogged. If I read this in a review I would have brought a different product.\n\nUp date on filter: Had to throw out a brand new filter, would not work for 2 days of banging and letting sit. Water still in reservoir. Open a new filter, and there was water inside the bag! Now what is water doing inside of a seal bag?????  These filters are too expensive to be throwing out when they are brand new, plus I have to travel to buy these filter. Going to get rid of this brand, and buy a different brand. Enough is enough!\nPS: Yes I have both dispensers! Will get rid of both. The theory is you fill up the smaller one then pour that into the bigger one to make the filter last longer. When the bigger dispenser reads .006 you that that filter and put it into the smaller one.;Put in a brand new filter in the pitcher early ...
22;43.0;2.0;11.0;The filters don't last long and they start to get gross-looking very quickly. The gel and charcoal bits floating in the filter reservoir are hideous and unappetizing.

3;44.0;1.0;5.0;So far a five. The only thing that keeps it from a five and a half is how slow it filters.  Takes about 5 minutes. About 3 minutes to long to my liking.\nMy water through a Brita filter reads 209, Zero filtered its 0 but I just got it. Brita and Pur do not take out chlorine or fluoride or lead.  10-12-17 I want to see how long a filter lasts. Some say only a few weeks in which case I'll be p$%%#d.\nUpdated\nAt my drinking water use which is low 15 gallons a month and my pre filtration readings 209 I can expect to use a filter every 8 weeks. Thats high. I can buy distilled water at the same cost. The difference is I don't have to carry all that water home and I don't use all that plastic. However $15/mo is a bit disappointing. So 4 stars.\nUpdated\nWell the filter lasts me 8 weeks. Also I can taste the water even at zero. You can see an explanation on line. Who cares, it slightly tart. 3 stars.\nUpdated after two months\nPut in the replacenent filter, the water reads 56. I cant return it I have it 2 months. Im not buying more to see if this is a defective one at $15 a filter.;Very nice a bit pricey/tart water/defective replacement filter

I've had mine a few months and the spigot at the bottom just decided to disconnect from the unit, so it spills water everywhere.  I am also not thrilled with the inability to contact Amazon directly since the purchase is over 30 days. I've contacted Zerowater and we'll see how they respond.;Great filter, not a well designed pitcher
50;46.0;1.0;14.0;I have owned this pitcher for less than two weeks. At first, it seemed amazingly good: as advertised the TDS meter showed that my drinking water was rated at zero TDS (our tap water is rather hard in our municipality, so this was an incredible improvement).\n\nHowever, today the water suddenly became very, very acidic  like it was mixed with a solution of lemon juice  and the TDS reading read 894! Eight hundred ninety-four (lest you think that numeral was a typo)!! I am deeply concerned that this presents a dangerous health hazard to my family, and have written to the company to demand a refund of the full purchase price. I would update you to let you know if they honor this request, but as I'm already giving this dangerous product the lowest possible rating, it's not like their bad customer service can affect my opinion of this product any further!\n\nBottom line: if you love your family, DO NOT BUY this product, for fear of potential poisoning.;DO NO BUY IF YOU LOVE YOUR FAMILY
64;47.0;5.0;15.0;I ordered this water filter/picture hoping it actually does what it says it does, with a large part of skepticism in mind. Let me first say, it does remove stuff from the water, fluoride included. I've done a few tests, other than TDS.\n\nFirst of the TDS meter read 035 from the tap, 025 from a brita filter, and 034 from another filter I've been using. This filter did read 000.\n\nNext, I was able to test the Chlorine residual, fluoride risidual, and water pH after filter, for those interested and skeptical. I did use my tap water as a control, and the filtered water as the test. I also tested them more than once to be sure.\n\nChlorine went from a .85mg/l to a .02-.04mg/l. Not much of a surprise as most water pitcher filters remove chlorine.\nFluoride went from a whopping .968mg/l to and average of .039mg/l.\nI forgot to mention pH when I originally wrote this. This filter as not effect on pH. Before and after pH was a consistent 7.5.\n\nI believe this is a true ion exchange filter after testing it, however, I can't imagine it will last that long as there just simply isn't that much surface area for the ion exchange resin.\n\nThis is the reason the filter may not last that long, but is also the reason the filter works. If you're looking for a cheaper solution in the long term look into RO systems. However, if you get 30-50 gallons per filter, consider the cost per gallon. Still cheaper than bottled water. Takes out way more than any normal carbon filter, which are designed for taste and odors.\n\nAt $10-15 a filter, and say, 40 gallons per filter. That's about .25 - .40 cents a gallon. Generally more than half the cost of bottled water. Purchase a good water bottle or 2, and it pays for itself.. sorta. lol\n\nI'm happy, as no other filter that I've seen does this outside of RO and distillation. I can't speak for the longevity of the filters, as it's been one day. Will post back in the future.;It actually removes stuff
53;48.0;1.0;14.0;"On the plus side -- and the reason for 2 stars -- the ZeroWater filtration of dissolved solids is outstanding.  The filter itself is the best.\n\nBUT.  But, the fact that ZeroWater went with this design speaks to a contempt for the customer that is unmistakeable and unambiguous.  Designing a pitcher may involve a bit more than is immediately obvious, but anyone can test one. 1)  Fill it.  Does it hold the water placed in it?  Yes.  Check.  2)  Pour out a glass of water.  Does  the water leave the pitcher?  Yes.  Check. Does it go where it is directed?  No.  Ooops!\n\nEven with practice and attention, this pitcher must be used over the sink if one doesn't want to add a second step to the ""simple"" act of pouring a glass of water -- mopping up the water that invariably spills to the counter.\n\nIt's a flaw impossible for the alleged ""designers"" to have missed, so I can only conclude that they didn't give a hoot that their brain-dead design fails.  Note that the pitcher flares out at the top.  So, when one tips the pitcher to pour (i.e., when you get to the tipping point) the water rushes from the narrower base over the flared bowl thereby a) creating a waterfall effect that accelerates the water's spped.  This problem is worsened by the rounded (rather than pointed) pouring area which does not then focus the waterfall into a narrow (and direct-able) stream.  (Visualize the pitcher in a pouring position parallel to the floor.  Now, you can see how there is a hill between the reservoir and the flare for the water to accelerate over).\n\nThis is my second Zerowater pitcher.  The first had to be replaced when the plastic handle detached at the bottom of the handle from the pitcher's body -- the result of a couple of years of stress on that handle caused by its bearing the weight of the pitcher.  This pitcher places even more stress at the bottom of the handle.\n\nIf it were to be revealed that this pitcher was the result of an MIT challenge to its engineering students to design a pitcher with the worst possible water flow, I wouldn't be at all surprised.  And I'd have to congratulate the designers for exceeding all expectations.  It's hard to imagine a pitcher less up to its simple task.\n\nThe original pitcher had less of a flare and a lip that came to a point.  You could, without spilling a drop, fill the individual cubes of an ice tray.  Alas, that design was retired for this joke.  The way you fill an ice cube tray with this model is:  a) to be darn sure to do it over the sink, and b) to let the water splash in until the tray is full (ignore the water that goes down the drain -- a bit of a drag since filling a ZeroWater pitcher takes a bit of time thanks to the slow water fall of its five-stage filter.\n\nZero Technologies seems not to care.  This pitcher goes beyond bad design and sinks all the way to insult -- from Zero Technologies to its customers.\n\nAlas, I don't know of a competing product (short of a system in the $600 and up range) that does such a good job of water filtration.  So, every day, I find myself cursing a bit as I use this pitcher and hope when this handle fails (as it surely will given the stresses on it) that there will be a third design out for the ZeroWater pitcher -- one that has actually been tested.\n\nOh, forget the two stars.  The pitcher is so terrible at pouring that it overwhelms the asset of the effective filter.  It deserves only the one star I'm now assigning to it.";Pour and Mop
42;49.0;1.0;12.0;I did a big research before I purchased this pitcher and was convinced that ZeroWater filters most heavy metals. Its been one month and 5 days so far and the water started tasting very ACIDIC. I can't drink it. Besides the nasty lemony flavor the acidic taste tells me that the water's pH is bellow the neutral 7 pH. Drinking acidic water is Not Good for any human. This should be enought for most informed people to understand that this waterpitcher is not good.\nI thought about changing the filter but that would mean that I'd have to use a new filter every month and end up costing around $150 just for filters fear year. No thanks. Might as well buy reverted osmosis system.\nThe worst part is the return period is 1 month ( just enough before water starts tasting like lemons).;Beware! ACIDIC Water !
9;50.0;1.0;6.0;I love that it filters well and has the tester that comes with it, but, it will NOT pour without leaking all over the counters or floor unless the pitcher is almost empty.

I want to love this but I hate it every time I'm wiping up the spills.;WHAT AM I DOING WRONG???

100;52.0;1.0;15.0;"I purchased this pitcher a few months ago, and at first I loved it.  Then I ran out of the original filters and had to buy the redesigned replacements (more narrow on the bottom, not like pictured here). There's something drastically wrong with the new design.

Someone else who had the same problem (in another review here) recommended tapping the top of the filter to get rid of the air bubbles.  When I called Zero Water, they recommended the same thing, only they called it ""burping.""  This works, but I had to ""burp"" the filter really hard at least four times each time I added water.  After I did this, I could actually see the bubbles pop and the water begin to drain.  Since it's necessary to fill the top part of the pitcher at least twice in order to get a full pitcher, it's a royal pain to use.

14;54.0;3.0;7.0;I'm certain most users feel this way but I figured I'll add my review anyway. The pitcher is terrible! It's frustrating that for such a great filter, they designed a below par pitcher. Most other companies got that part right, why not just fix it to have the perfect product? The filters last me only a couple of weeks so it's very pricy but no other filtration system has come close to this quality of water so I will stick with it. Until, that is, someone comes up with a much better design and comparable filter. The lid spout does not pour well and leaks all over when poured. The button is hard to press and should just be a simple pull up toggle instead. Also, since I leave it out on the counter, the bright blue is so unsightly. It should really be a neutral color that appeals to everyone. I did contact the company to see if they have any plans of re-designing. I tried the aquagear water filter recently and was convinced that I will switch but the taste was just off, although, the pitcher was much better. So I am back to ZeroWater and hope they come out with a new version soon!;The pitcher is terrible! It's frustrating that for such a great filter

78;56.0;1.0;12.0;I purchased this pitcher from Target after knocking my Brita pitcher off the counter and broke it. My husband saw on consumer reports that zero water was really good. After we filled it we found that the water spout on the back leaked. I was ready to take it back. Then I noticed something floating in the water. It was the little rubber seal for the spout. I was able to reinstall it and it stopped leaking. Well after two weeks the water was foul. Undrinkable, not even the dogs would drink it! We got about six weeks out of our Brita pitcher (only two people using it). The Zero Water filters are twice the price of the Brita filters, and we had to change it WAY too soon. Our water tested at 348 and was back up to that number after just two weeks of using it. With all the stuff CR said about it we thought the higher priced filters would be worth it. It wasn't.

Called customer service very honestly and non-accusatory to see if there was possibly an issue with a batch of filters, and why the reading would jump so quickly.  Customer service had condescending tone, and basically said that ""it happens,"" and it's ""like running your water through garbage and you're expecting filtered water.""  Water will be even dirtier if you reach the tipping point.  You have to be really diligent about testing the water ""several times a week,"" to avoid drinking acidic, bad-tasting water, and expect to change it fairly often.";Acidic, bad-tasting water after about a month's use, be prepared to check and change filter often.
36;59.0;1.0;8.0;I live in Southern California and the water down here tastes pretty bad.  I have used the Brita filter as well as the Mavea filters but wanted to give this Zerowater a try.\n\nFirst three days of use were wonderful.  The water tasted great.  I loved the filter so much I ordered another one to leave in the fridge, one for normal room temp water and one for chilled water.\nOn the fourth day my water started to get real SOUR tasting.  I thought wow, I must have a defective filter.  So I call Zerowater customer service and they ask for my water readings so they could explain the durability of my filter.  I said I took 4 readings of my water and all readings were between 300-400 ppm.  Keep in mind that I am a chemist and I know how statistics matter in gathering data.  The helpless customer service lady said at readings of 300 I should be able to filter about 15 gallons of water. At 400 I could filter about 10.  She then told me she needed the exact reading to calculate my filter and I said well let's call them all 400 but she still was demanding the exact readings even though I only filtered 4 gallons through my filter which is less than both of her estimates.  I know things fail, but she offered NO EXPLANATION and told me they don't replace filters unless I provided the exact amount of contaminants even though I told her to assume all readings at 400(even if she est. my contaminants at 500ppm I should still get 8 gallons)...so instead I am just returning the pitcher to amazon as defective because the rep told me there was nothing she would do for me.  Possibly one of the worst customer service reps I have ever worked with - sounds like she takes a lot of calls like this and is used to customers not being happy with the life of the filter.\n\nShe also stated that when the filter is fully used, it will release all of the contaminants it had previously filtered, and would be dirtier than the water you are filtering.  So that sour I was drinking - was more toxic than the tap water.  Be careful and do your research.\n\nhere is a link to the life expectancy of their filter.\nhttp://www.zerowater.com/filter-durability.aspx\n\nHere is a link to their site - you can check the contaminants in your zip code so you can predict how much you will spend on this filter.\nhttp://www.zerowater.com/tds.aspx?zip=\n\nIf you live in an area where the contaminants are 300-400ppm expect your filter to last anywhere from 4-15 gallons and then your filter will need to be replaced more than once a week if you consume a gallon of water per day. One filter costs ~13 dollars, so expect to pay 52 dollars per months in filters.  At this cost you should consider a true water filtration system.  If you have a family of four expect to replace the filter at least once a day.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/ZeroWater-ZR-001-Replacement-Filter-1-Pack/dp/B003QXM57Y/ref=pd_sim_79_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=18BYD388C1YBZ71Z7GG9;DO NOT BUY THIS FILTER - CAN MAKE YOUR WATER DIRTIER AND CUSTOMER SERVICE DOESN'T CARE
62;60.0;1.0;9.0;"Zero water makes such claims-after one month the filter is done and my water tastes awful -SOUR! I thought I was imagining things at first but no I read online this happens. I feel it's too costly to replace the filter every few weeks plus the pitcher is big and clumsy and the ""spout"" very hard to hold pressed in, takes for ever to fill a glass of water,and the fridge is open the whole time. The gauge is almost a gimmick to me and the filter can't handle many ""inorganic"" water contaminants. My town of Saddlebrook New Jersey has horrible water, I got this specifically for this reason. The zero filter is unsuitable for the tap water that needs to be filtered most. Waste of money.\n\nThank you and take care,";Feel very deceived
26;61.0;1.0;6.0;At first I loved this. I bought it a month and a week ago. I should have listened to the other reviews posted. Last night I went to drink water from it and it tasted very sour. I cleaned it all out like the website has suggested and filtered more water though a few times and it's the same. It's also reading 54. My tap water reads at 252. I live alone and there's no reason it should stop working this soon. Now I can't even return it. Don't waste your time or money on this brand.;Sour water after a month!
18;62.0;3.0;5.0;"Well, this works perfectly as advertised. However, you need to fully understand its limits in areas with a high level of Total Dissolved Solids in the water. My tapwater runs ~250 TDS before filtering, and the Zero pitcher filtered that to 000 for about 10 days. By the 2-week mark, we'd gone through about 30gal of water, and the filter was done. Not only was the TDS reading actually higher post-filtering, but the water reeked with an odd fishy smell. An online search shows that we're not the first to experience this.\n\nFull marks for an effective filter, but completely impractical for us to replace it every 2 weeks. See if you can determine your area's TDS level before purchasing; it might be worth it in a region with softer water.";Run the numbers first
55;63.0;1.0;8.0;"EDIT:  3 Weeks after buying this, we noticed a HORRID ROTTING FISH ODOR in our kitchen.  After doing some searching, we found it was the filter and the water pushed through the filter of this pitcher.  We immediately researched it and found that a breakdown in the filtering process causes this odor.  If you search ""zerowater smells like fish"" you will get pages of google results from reviews to forums where people are experiencing this same problem. It is both embarrassing and gross - we immediately threw this pitcher away and bought a pur tap filter.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: ------------------------------------------------------\nI was using a brita before this and switched because this has nicer filtering.

89;64.0;1.0;9.0;Initially, I was very impressed with the taste and quality of the water.  The pitcher had a lot of problems, I ended up not even using the cover, it was so flimsy, but I was impressed with the taste of the water and the fact that it was so pure.  The problem is that I drink a lot of water and noticed that the water starts tasting really bad (much worse than the tap water I am filtering) very quickly.  I would have to purchase a new filter every 2 weeks.  Too expensive.  Very disappointed.;Great.. at first
44;65.0;1.0;7.0;"No matter how many times I washed it with soap and ran full pitchers of water through the filter, the ""filtered"" water ALWAYS tasted like the plastic this thing is made of.\n\nAlso it's pretty poorly designed: The rim around the spout for the top-divider has really sharp edges that will scrape you when you wash it.  Basically a piece of junk with a gimmicky TDS meter on top.  Don't buy.  I ended up getting a Soma instead.";Water tastes like plastic, poor design
45;66.0;1.0;7.0;We have had so much trouble with this filter. Each filter only lasts about 3 weeks, and then the filtered water tastes like rust, even though the meter is reading 000. We have had 3 replacement filters since the original and they ALL do this- not the result of user error. We have contacted the manufacturer multiple times and their only solution is to try a new filter. Very disappointed in this product. Would not buy again, would not recommend to anyone.;Rust-tasting water after 3 weeks, meter reads 000
92;67.0;1.0;9.0;"The water was awesome at first.  Loved the ""tap"" on the back for ease of getting water while filtering.  The pitcher was heavy when full and does take a long time to filter through, all known things before placing my order.  Less than a month into using the pitcher the water started to taste like lemons.  I thought my son dumped some of his lemon crystal light into the pitcher.  After the taste lasting a few days I inspected the filter closer and noticed it was starting to ""leak"" some of its pieces into the top.  The black flakes and brown-ish colored granule type things.  I cleaned everything out and tested out the water again and the flavor was awful.  I tested it and it measured over 700.  I drink too much water to have to replace a filter every 3 weeks to get below the 006 so this purchase was a big disappointment and I would not recommend it to anyone.";Great at first - quickly disappointed
46;68.0;1.0;7.0;We for this as an upgrade to our Brita filter after reading the positive reviews.  After a week or so with the new filter, the water suddenly started smelling a little off.  I replaced the filter and in another week the same strange smell started occurring, like rotten eggs.  New filter and the same thing happened again.  Not sure what caused the buildup that creates the smell, but we're back to the Brita and now use this as a pitcher and no longer use the filters.;Water smelled funny after a week
35;69.0;1.0;6.0;"My experience with ZeroWater filtration system has been confusing and frustrating.\n\nI purchased a ZeroWater ZP-010 10-Cup Pitcher from Amazon on May 13th. Since I setup the system and began using it on June 1st I've gone through a total of two zero water filters, making the average lifespan of a filter 1 month long.\n\nThe first filter that came with the device managed to read near zero on the TDS water testing system, compared to my Brita system that was in the range of 98. I was impressed and thought the water tasted great.\n\nAfter approximately a month went by the ""flavorless-ness"" of the water was replaced by a sour citric taste in the water. This made the water unpalatable, and made my wife and me very confused as to the cause of such a distortion. We replaced the water filter thinking that it was the cause, and it turned out to be the case.\n\nOur second water filter has now done something very similar, except now our water tastes sour as opposed to citric-y as before.\n\nI've read through the website's FAQ, I've cleaned the system, I believe I've installed everything correctly, but what I'm most confused about is how this filter can last only one month, and why the water tastes so strange? The water that is filtered through ZeroWater tastes worse than unfiltered tap water.\n\nIn addition to how quickly the filters have turned over, the pitcher's functionality is abysmal. You might expect this pitcher to pour water into a standard size drinking container without splashing liquid on your floor, but that's not the case. The simplest of pourings always cause water to leak out where it's not expected and miss the intended target. The same is true for the ""pinch and release"" mechanism on the back - it produces a wide and wild spread that makes a mess. We cannot pour water from this device anywhere other than over the sink.";"Filters don't last; pitcher doesn't work"
104;70.0;1.0;9.0;This is really a disappointment since I'd love to have crystal pure water. For 10 days this system worked and then basically stopped flowing. So we called customer service and they told us to poke a hole in each triangled area of the top of the filter. That seemed to work a bit but after awhile it just wouldn't go.\n\nAnd even if it works, expect a LONG time for the flow. I've heard from some in my area that it works but we did everything and it just wouldn't work. Got the newer filters too since the one in the box has 4 triangled area and the new ones have around 8.\n\nThe problem is that at the bottom, the water has to flow through virtually a pin prick hole. I have no clue why they made the outflow that insanely small.\n\nSo unfortunately I had to go back to Brita and be content.;Worked awhile, then would NOT flow
38;71.0;1.0;6.0;"I'm not a frequent reviewer, but this particular item was infuriating enough to warrant a log in.  We bought this about 5 weeks ago.  For the first two weeks, it worked great, and we were frankly impressed by the meter and its ""000"" readings.  About week 6, the water took on an **extremely** unpleasant lemony/acidic flavor.  We were stunned - a flavor that our regular tap water doesn't have (tap water in our area isn't actually all that bad).  And interestingly, a TDS reading above the starting level of our tap water.  By their own measuring stick, they were actually *adding* bad stuff to our water!  Flushing the filter didn't help at all, and we realized that we had both felt a bit bad after drinking the water in our morning coffee and tea.  So, I did a bit of googling, and sure enough, there are *tons* of reports online of this same problem.  The ZW team even sort-of addresses it in their FAQs, but they try to attribute it to filters that need changing or particularly bad tap water in some areas.  I wrote to their support email.  Crickets.  Basically, this was a waste of money, and I'd encourage others to avoid the product.";AVOID
25;72.0;1.0;5.0;We had this pitcher for 5 weeks thinking that it would replace our Brita pitcher. Big NO WAY!  After 5 weeks the water became very sour/ acidic.  We were not sure if we did something wrong so we stated researching the problem.  We found out that there is a filtering process that these pitcher uses that as the filter breaks down it makes the water acidic.  With the filters being so expensive and the water quality not that much better than the Brita we are staying with the Brita.;Water pitcher gone bad!
43;73.0;2.0;6.0;I know that the water in my neighbourhood is not the best tasting water. I decided to buy a pitcher water filter and started to do my research. I came to to conclusion that Zero Water had the best product in the market. When I received my water filter the filtered water tasted amazing! but a few weeks later the water started to have an acid taste. I measured it and as expected, the filter was not working any more, in fact it was adding this horrible taste to the water and according to the meter the faucett water and filtered water were measuring the same.\nThen i started to read more reviews and multiple people were complaining of the same issue.\nI decided to give zero water another chance... maybe I had a bad filter.... so I marked the day I installed my new filter: April 2nd. By April 28th I noticed the acid flavour again. I measured the water and the meter was displaying a 7.\n\nThis also starts when this residue starts showing on the unfiltered water section. There are these little balls that start getting yellow.\n\nRegarding the usage I am the only one that uses the filtered water. I use it for every day drinking and for coffee and tea. I did notice that my water boiler build up residue is diminishing so i do think the filter works good.\n\nI do agree with other reviewers, less than 4 weeks of life is too short for the price of the filter. also I don't know if that acid taste in the water is dangerous or not, I would prefer the water to taste back as it does from the faucett than the filter adding this strange taste.... at this point I am not sure if i should keep using it.\n\nI also found a chart of gallons vs tap water TDS. My tap water is under 270, that should give me between 15 and 25 gallons. after making the math if I use 8 cups of water per day for 26 days I may already need a new filter. So it seems to be working as expected but unfortunately the life of the filter is too short.;Filter life is too short
56;74.0;2.0;7.0;I am returning this to Amazon.\nAfter two weeks of amazing water, a fish-like odor developed in the filtered water.  Before this the water quality was outstanding.  After a call to ZW about this, the rep asked what the TDS reading was from my tap water, which is around 400ppm(Public well source). High for sure.  She told me that in cases like this, the carbon part of the filter is the first to go (which is where the odor was coming from) and will be spent after approximately 12 gallons of filtration.  FWIW, that's probably very close to how much I had put through it.\nShe then explained that the replacement cost of the filter being what it is (~$30), that it would put me at about $1/gallon, not exactly cheaper than bottled water.  She then stated she could understand how this might not be cost effective.  Having said all of that, I appreciate the transparency of the customer service rep and the quality of the pitcher is otherwise good.;Fish odor after 2 weeks of use

I start with the filters. Constant black particles and black film in the reservoir (unfiltered water) . Complaint to Zero Water. Very uncooperative. Told me to take it up with Amazon. Finally got a response. This is the reply.\nWe have recently made some structural changes to the filters. One of the changes is using a finer grade of carbon in the filtration process. During shipping some of this carbon has been getting knocked loose. What you are seeing in the reservoir is simply particles of that carbon. As this is part of the filtration process, although not pretty to look at, is not harmful at all so long as the particles are not coming through the filter.\nAs long as it is not going into the actual water you drink it is fine. If this is happening please contact our technical team at 1-800-503-2939 option #2 Monday through Friday 8 AM to 8 PM.\nWe recommend that you fill the pitcher with another glass or pitcher as the water pressure from the faucet can also knock loose the carbon.\nAmazon was nice enough to send me replacement filters. Still getting black particles and black film. How do I know that it is not going through filter. Why did Zero Water - aware of the issue - not send out replacement filters?\nThe pitcher itself is flimsy. The lid doesn't fit tight. When pouring it falls off. Water splashes out of spout from both sides. The edge around the reservoir (unfiltered water) is rough and unfinished. When washing out the black sued I have scratched my hand. Because of the uneven finish and sharp edge around the reservoir (unfiltered water) it is very difficult to clean out the black residue.\nThe water does taste good. Expensive. I am a single person household. Have to change the filter every 2 weeks. What gets me is. That I use already filtered water. I just want the fluoride removed. One would think that filtered water would make Zero Water filter last longer.\nAmazon offered me to return the product. I would gladly do it if I did not have to do the packing and taking it to the UPS store. Zero Water is not customer friendly. They ask you to contact them before posting a negative review. Yet they are not compliant.\nAll they had to do is sent out a new package of filters with the newly  made structural changes and I would be a happy customer. It is what it is.\nUpdate\n1/1/2014. Just put in a new filter. Had washed and dried pitcher and reservoir. Added water by jug.  The plack film and little black particles are back. Amazon. Please come and pack this up. I don't want it any morel";Poor quality. Needs better design.
49;76.0;1.0;6.0;After about a month....the water tasted AWFUL acidic...nasty! not drinkable at all. Normally when a filter is at the end of it's lifecycle, it doesn't taste this bad. I've never been that vigilant about changing them right on time and the water was still drinkable.\n\n I used it for 3 people for about one month...used it for water in soups, cooking plus drinking. But still. to buy filters every month? NOT happening. I'm so disappointed. I'm with the other reviewers - one star for sure! Still after one month of use, it's ridiculous to have to change the filter every few weeks or month. It's not cost effective!;Nasty acidic bitter water after a few weeks - NOT drinkable
32;77.0;5.0;5.0;I bought this reluctantly because of reviews I have read about the filters not lasting very long.  I bought it at Target because I had a gift card and a $10 coupon.  I also purchased a Brita filter at the same time because I had a Brita pitcher and wanted to do a comparison test using fresh filters.  I did a test on the tap water using the the TDS meter and the tap water here is about 189 ppm.  I then ran water through the fresh Brita and it came out 87ppm.  I thin took and poured the water from the Brita into the Zero Water and it came out 000.  It has now been over three months and I still get a reading of 000 using the Brita as a prefilter.  I haven't tested the Zero Water with straight tapwater but why mess up a good system when you have it.  I am guessing that it would last a good time with straight tap water here.  I am thinking that the people who had a very short life of the filter has very toxic water.;I haven't tested the Zero Water with straight tapwater but why mess up a good system when you have it
72;78.0;1.0;7.0;I should have Googled the reviews, but this product is dead last on any list. It seemed to work for a few weeks, but then the water testing went bad, so got new EXPENSIVE filters and they lasted maybe, at most, a couple weeks, making the cost of water five times or more what it should have been or could be bought for at the store.\n\nAlso, this is so, so, so, so, so slow to fill and filter.\n\nThe construction is okay, but do a Google search and see what rea reviews say about this product, and it is not good at all, in fact I think dead last.;Would Not Buy This
52;79.0;1.0;6.0;"My water from tap usually gets a reading from the TDS meter of 270-300. The first filter got a ""fishy"" smell to it.  I know it came from the filter because I smelled the water from the tap before I filtered it and then again after I filtered it.\n\nThe second filter lasted less than 3 weeks so I tested the tap water versus the filtered water.  The tap water had gone up to 470 and the filtered water had the same reading!  I calculated how often I would have to replace the filter during the summer months when the tap water was ""extra bad"" and realized buying bottled water was cheaper.  The second filter never got the ""fishy"" smell but it did start showing sand and black specks floating up from the filter after only the first week of use.  I don't know what these particles were but they were coming from the filter not the tap water.\n\nMy ""100% mountain spring"" bottled water gets a reading of 270.  My ""major city municipal water supply"" sourced bottled water gets a reading of 18.  So beware that even bottled water will have a great disparity in quality based on the readings from the zerowater meter.\n\nEven if the filters were much cheaper so they could compete with the bottled water price, I'm not sure I'd want to keep using this system.  I don't understand the ""fishy"" smell so many reviewers and I have reported.  And I don't like that the filter can back up and expunge sand and black particles.\n\nIt is hard to find but the zerowater website does show typical readings in your area and on another page has a chart that shows how many gallons of water you can expect your filter to filter before needing to be replaced.  So do the math and see if it makes money sense to buy this product.  Then decide if you want a filter that can either make your water smell fishy and/or make the filter process look unsightly.\n\nUpdate:  I thought I'd try my last filter now that it is winter.  The filter got the ""fishy"" smell after just 3 refills in the pitcher!  That filter lasted only 4 days!  And immediately got ""black specks"" from the filter leaking out at the top.  I could not believe it.  What a total waste of $70 (pitcher plus the 2 filter replacement pack).  DO NOT BUY!!!!  I will never trust a Consumer Reports review again.";bottled water is cheaper
86;80.0;5.0;7.0;I have used a version of this system for nearly 3 years. I have a 3 story house and I have 1 per floor.  My tap water tests at about 180ppm and as advertised the pitcher routinely puts out a zero.  I am one of those people that can really taste nuances in water so when the taste is off I change the filter.  For me it is about every 3 1/2 months.\n\nThe second filling does take longer than the first but that is basic science.  There is no way to prevent it without shortening the filter.\n\nFor best tasting water make sure the filter is extremely snug.  It is plastic so it can break but get it good and tight.  With a new filter, fill the hopper, let it filter and then run the water back through again.\n\nAvoid buying the older filters.  I know people complain about them taking longer but with the cover at the top it keeps the charcoal out of the hopper.  The charcoal didn't hurt anything but it looked nasty.\n\nLastly if you are going away or not planning on using the unit for about 10 days dry the filter completely.  If you leave it wet it reduces the life of the filter substantially and if long enough, immediately.  When you put it back in service run a batch of water through it twice again.;Excellent
87;81.0;5.0;7.0;I've tried all of the other brands known by most and sold in stores and this one is by far the best. The water is left with no taste at all, which is how it should be. Honestly I don't even use the little tester half the time because I can tell just by the taste of the water when the filter needs to be replaced. Before I bought this I thought the tap water tasted alright, I live in an area where it is actually pretty clean. But....now....it clearly smells like lake water to me and has a very distinct and noticeable taste. My only gripe is the cost of the filters, since I workout a lot I drink a lot of water and they only last 2-3 weeks. But...I mean....I drink A LOT of water, they last 1-2 weeks longer for my friend.;Great water filter
54;82.0;4.0;6.0;"I love this filter.  Having the meter makes it very clear what this filter is doing (and what my old filter was not doing).  My water went from 110 PPM (which is not bad) down to 0.  And, because I have the meter, I don't have to replace the cartridge until it is really needed.  I'm going on 2+ months with the original cartridge, and I'm still getting ""zero water"" out of it.  All the chlorine taste is removed and my coffee tastes great.  I also like the size, since it is big enough that you don't have to re-fill it each time you take a drink.\n\nSo, why am I only giving it 4 stars, instead of 5?  The design of the pitcher is embarrassingly bad:\n\n1.  In order to fill it, you have to remove the entire top of the filter.  No flip up door,..no easy grip spot on the lid...it's awkward.\n\n2.  The handle is angled the wrong way.  In order to hold the pitcher level, you have to bend your wrist backward.  It's uncomfortable to hold.  Most competing pitchers have a handle angled like a gun, so holding the pitcher level means your wrist is angled down slightly, which is comfortable.  This pitcher is only comfortable to hold when you're pouring it straight down.\n\n3.  The floppy lid that covers the spout will guarantee that you splash water all over your tables and counters.  You cannot pour water into a narrow glass without splashing.\n\n4.  The little water spigot on the back is a joke.  The idea was good, have a spout, so you can fill a glass, without having to take the pitcher out of the refrigerator. But it is so tiny, you'll be standing there for 2 minutes, to fill a glass.  I would rather they had left this off, since this isn't usable and is a potential point of failure for the pitcher.\n\nThis is a brilliant filter surrounded by a pathetic pitcher.  If ZeroWater put half the effort into the pitcher, that their competitors do, they would have a world class product.\n\n*Update* My first filter lasted over 2 1/2 months, with 110 ppm water to start.";Somewhere, a design engineer is crying

68;87.0;3.0;6.0;I bought this pitcher for city water in Southern California. It was amazing. The water was tasteless and clear. I tried drinking from a bottle of water after drinking zero water and could taste the plastic bottle! That's how wonderful the pitcher was. I replaced my filter after about 2 months - it lasted so long and was so great.\n\nThen we moved to southern Florida. Our well water is really bad. I mean, sulfur smelling, salt tasting nastiness. I hoped that my zero water pitcher could do for me here what it did in California. No. It doesn't even last 2 weeks before I need to replace the $15 filter. That's at least $30 a month for filters and I can buy bottled water for less. I just have to deal with the plastic taste.\n\nMy advice, find out what your ppm rating is before you get this. In Ca - it was only 200 ppm. Here in Florida it maxes out the reader at 999 ppm. Ick.;Watch your locale
47;88.0;1.0;5.0;When I first unboxed this and used it for the first time, it was awesome.  The water tasted so fresh and clean, I was ecstatic.  After about 2 weeks of use, the water started tasting like it had been mixed with a little orange juice or something and kind of tingled my tongue.\n\nI was trying to figure out what would cause this.  I washed it all out and tried again, still there.\n\nThen, I started searching online.  This seems to be a common complaint as the filter uses an acidic process to clean the water.  Maybe it is the water in my area, but that meant only about 2 weeks of use before tasting disgusting.  Plus, I tested it with an actual PH meter.  Anything under 7 is acidic....the water was just over a 4.  I don't like the idea of drinking gallons of acidic water.  Returning it to Amazon and going with a more standard carbon filter.;Beware - Acidic tasting water and short filter life
74;89.0;1.0;6.0;"The filter-technology may be great but overall this product suffers critical design flaws. First, the lids are insecure. Upon assembly you'll be second guessing yourself: Did I put the lid on correctly? It's not quite snug. You did. The lid's just terrible (expect spills in your future). The most critical flaw, however, is its height. IF you have a standard kitchen sink and standard faucet--nothing fancy or professional grade--the sink won't be deep enough. Naturally you must pass water through its filter, which takes forever. And that would be fine if could let the tap run, walk away, let it filter and then collect your ""clean"" water later. That's not going to happen without a bar-like faucet. Without a deep basin or high faucet, you'll need to angle the pitcher, babying it the entire time as you pass water through the filter in order to fill a complete pitcher. Is this product really worth the time, hassle and frustration? Absolutely not.";Ain't Nobody Got Time for That!
83;90.0;5.0;6.0;I am as most trying to drink more water daily(supposed to be good 4 u or some to those lines) and have tried Brita, PUR and few of the lesser known brands. Then i heard of 0water and my geek midget has demanded a purchase due to the included electronic meter stick-thing. When i got it i metered all the water(and some beer even) with the meter and was surprised to see it actually work(no idea what those TDS's its measuring are but its not just picking random numbers as i thought it would). At 1st i found water filtered with 0water taste harsh when compared to PUR(my last filter) and for some reason it took me about 3 pitchfulls to get to 0(kept showing 15-35 after filtration). Then it finally started working as it should and registering 0 after filtration. My tap water registers anywhere from 70 to 120(Everett, MA(10 mins from downtown Boston)) and thats not too bad as some tap water in US can go over 250 apparently. I got used to the taste(which is quite different from PUR, or my friends uber$$$ under the sink filtration system(looks like mini water boiler)) but i drink it now daily and don't mind or even like the taste. The get-more-for-your$$$ dwarf in me demanded i find the most efficient way to use my newly aquired 0water system and seemed like getting an 8-pack of filters here on amazon with subscribe and save(amazon has SS on 8 pack very often and it comes out to $68 for 8-pack with free shipping, if not atm - just wait a while) it came out to exactly $8.50 per filter - which is actually cheaper than what i was paying for PUR filters($9-12). Well its been 11 weeks and i drink about a pitcher-full daily and my filtered water still registers as 0 while tap water still reads 70-120(so i know meter still works fine) and i would have been on the 2nd PUR filter by now. If all filters prove to be as long-lasting(read claims that included filter is better than those bought separately ones-yet to check that claim) my 8-pack should go a very long way. Overall very happy with the system!;Best water filter system under $100
85;91.0;1.0;6.0;"After my former roommate recommended this to me I stocked up on 3 pitchers, 1 each for my home, office, and girlfriend's, here in the Denver metro area. I also bought two 2-packs of replacement filters. Out of those 7 filters 5 of them went sour or rancid in exactly one week. The first filter for my home pitcher went bad and the one I replaced it with worked fine for about a month. The first filter for my office went sour after 1 week and it's replacement worked for roughly one month. All 3 filter's at my girlfriend's home went bad after exactly 1 week every time.\n\nI emailed their ""customer service"" and received a useless generalized response which did not even address my issue.\n\nThese filters are too unreliable and consequentially a waste of money and an inconvenience. There are many other choices available and I recommend you avoid Zero Water.\nYou have been warned...";Filters consistantly go sour after 1 week
51;92.0;1.0;5.0;I was very happy with this pitcher the first TWO weeks.  I was diagnosed with vocal cord cancer and knew I couldn't be drinking water with fluoride and chlorine anymore.  All of the sudden, the water started smelling and tasting horribly like FISH!!!!  I did some research and this is a very common customer complaint.  ZeroWater.....fix it or don't sell it.  Noone wants to drink fish water.;I was very happy with this pitcher the first TWO weeks
91;93.0;2.0;6.0;"If you have bad water, this is a terrible option.  You will need to replace the $15 filter way too frequently! I can buy a lot more water from the store for $15 than this pitcher can make.  The removable filter is huge, and isn't recyclable.  At least the gallon water containers from the store can be recycled.\n\nTo be fair, we have bad water to start with.  Our water from the tap measures at 600 TDS (the pitcher comes with a nice electronic solute tester).  At first, the water was exiting the filter at around 0-2 TDS.  It was great water... for 9 days\n\nToday, 9 days later, my water tastes WORSE after being filtered than from the tap; despite measuring at only 60 TDS.  I don't know how... but my water has a much worse bitter metallic taste.  Read the reviews on the filters alone rather than the pitcher for more info on this.\n\nAgain, to be fair, the manual says to only expect to yield 8 gallons of water per filter based on my tap water test results.  It also recommends to replace the filter at 6 TDS.  I just don't understand how water at 60 TDS can taste so much worse than my tap water at 600 TDS...  That's my problem with this product\n\nIf you have better tasting water to start with, this would work a lot better... but then again I wouldn't be filtering my water if it was less than 300 TDS anyways.\n\nDoes it do what it claims? Yes...  It gives you 8 VERY expensive gallons of water! Is it worthy of 4.5 stars? I don't think so!";Was good for 9 days...
98;94.0;4.0;6.0;Have had this pitcher for about a week now. Had to call customer service because the water stopped flowing through the filter. They told me to poke holes in the pie-shaped divisions in the top of the filter unit. That seems to have helped. They also told me that with our water testing at 498, the filter will last about 8-10 gallons (pitchers). That will get expensive. We only use it for the water for our finnicky Keurig coffee maker and are still waiting to see if the cleaner water will help the coffee maker. The interesting thing is that I forgot to remove the filter from the reservoir of the coffee maker when I started using the Zerowater and it leached all the calcium out of the filter onto the sides of the reservoir of the coffee maker. After a week the inside of the coffeemaker reservoir was white. I had to clean the reservoir with vinegar and remove the filter.\nOur water has a high reading but it doesn't taste bad so we use it for most other uses like cooking without problems. The low usage capacity of the Zerowater filter has made me decide to use our old Brita filter pitcher as a preliminary filter for the Zerowater. The water from the Brita reads right at 208, so that should extend the life of the Zerowater filter to a tolerable expense.\nUpdate: Using the Brita as a preliminary filter extends the life of the Zero filters considerably and at the same time I have not had to clean the coffeemaker in over a year now.;Has some problems.
99;95.0;1.0;6.0;"I wrote this review after I bought it, praising it for the delicious water. I take it all back!\n\nFirst of all, the area we live in has really bad water. Our water out of the faucet measures close to 400. The first time I used Zero water, the water reading came in at ""0"". It tasted great!\n\nAfter 3 weeks, I had some water and it tasted sour, or maybe like a weird citrus flavor. I measured it and it came back at over 600! Way worse than our tap water. I found that I would have to wash, and re-wash, and re-wash the container to try to get the reading with a NEW filter to read ""0"". Sometimes after tons of hot water washing, the meter would not go lower than ""001"". They tell you to replace the filter at ""008"". If I replaced it a ""008"" every time, I'd be replacing the filter every two weeks. That's way too expensive.\n\nToday I had a drink of water and it tasted like poison so I measured it and the reading was OVER 870! Just about three days ago it measured at ""008""! It became 100 times worse almost over night! After a little more than a year of using it, we are giving up. I did not want my old, favorable review of this product to stand. I felt an obligation to warn others that if they are in an area where the water out of the faucet is in the 100 or worse range, don't buy this product because having delicious water will only last for a couple of weeks, and at $15 a filter, your drinking water costs will go up, up, up.";Delicious for 3 weeks then tastes like poison
65;96.0;1.0;5.0;Not sure what happened... the pitcher seemed to work well initially but after replacing the filter, the water started smelling a little funny and the readings weren't good... the water out of the faucet was much better. I replaced the filter again but the water did not taste or test as well as it did at the beginning. Wrote an email to the manufacturer but haven't heard back. Can't return it because it's past the return period. Very disappointing. Can't recommend.;Worked Ok At First But Then Went Bad
69;97.0;2.0;5.0;Worked great for about a week - and it really did work well for that week.  We were very happy!\n\nThen, as has happened with others, suddenly the water started tasting VERY bad (bitter, fishy taste).  Our water starts off with a very high TDS - around 465 - so that may be why the filter didn't last long.  But at over $10 a pop, I'm not going to spend that kind of money.  I would much rather have a filter that would take my TDS down to around 25-50, but last a few weeks or a month.  Then it would be worth it.\n\n(Edit 8/31)\nI've done a bit more research and learned that ZeroWater is using a Deionization (DI), or Ion Exchange filter.  This is an expensive, but VERY effective filter.  It works by controlling the electric charge of ions in the water to remove TDS. Just like a positively charged magnet will attract a negatively charged magnet, DI resins attract non-water ions (TDS) and replace them with water ions, purifying the water.\n\nThe problem is, once enough TDS-water has passed through the filter, it stops working.  The higher your initial TDS the faster it will fail.  And when it fails, it fails completely and leaves a VERY bitter taste.\n\nAlmost all the bad reviews are because the filters fail too quickly, and hence aren't worth the cost (and of course, that bitter taste...).  So if you're considering this filter, I would recommend testing your water first - or if you don't want to invest $15 in a TDS meter (especially since, if you buy this, you'll get another one included with the pitcher) look at ZeroWater's website, which has average TDS ratings for your zip code.  The higher your TDS, the shorter the lifespan of each filter will be - and the more expensive this option will be.\n\nAlso, keep in mind I'm only talking about TDS.  This filter also has a carbon filter stage that (from my research) is very effective at removing other harmful chemicals and contaminants.  Other filters (like Pur) seem to be equally effective in that area - where ZeroWater really stands out is in removing TDS.\n\nFinally, I wasn't able to find any credible source (meaning, from someone not trying to sell me a filter) that said TDS was unhealthy below 1000 PPM.  Below that level, you're really just removing TDS to improve taste.  If you're fine with how your water tastes, then there isn't much point in lowering TDS.  Note that high TDS also indicates hard water, which can cause scaling in devices such as water heaters and coffee makers.  Even if you have a water softener, that will not lower TDS (it just replaces one dissolved solid with another).  Total dissolved solids remains pretty much the same.\n\nAs I said in my original review, if only they could develop a version of this filter that only reduced TDS to a more reasonable level (25-50) instead of trying to zero it out (e.g. use only one DI cycle instead of two).  Then the filters would last longer and be a much better option for folks like me in high-TDS regions.  Of course, then they'd have to change the name (Near-ZeroWater doesn't have as much of a ring to it)....;Filter only lasted a week
71;98.0;2.0;5.0;"Been using a ZW pitcher for 6 months now.  Cylinder shaped filters been lasting me about 4-5 weeks each. Get a sour taste when filter is spent.  Supplied TDS meter seems to indicate good filtration, though dissolved solids may include beneficial minerals,  not necessarily all bad things.  So, filter is good, but seems to have a fairly low capacity (needs changed frequently).  I'm concerned on reviews of the new bullet-shaped filters having even less filtering capacity (that is, an even shorter-life).  So, maybe four-stars on the filter.  However, the pitcher is entirely a one-star design.  Not only does the top pour spout splash a wide and erratic stream, but the lid actually lifts off from the light force of the water being poured.  I complained to ZW about this and they sent a replacement pitcher lid at no charge, but it has the same problem (and looks exactly the same as the original).  The lid does not 'click' or 'lock' on to the pitcher, it just covers it.  Bottom line, it makes a mess when I try to pour it, especially into a water bottle or something somewhat narrower than a drinking glass.  The spout on the handle takes way too long to fill anything, having to hold the button the whole time.  The fill partition doesn't have enough slope to drain the unfiltered water completely through the filter, and because of the loose fitting lid, this unfiltered water often makes it's way into the drinking glass when I pour and the lid lifts off (allowing the unfiltered water to get by).  Overall, I'm dissatisfied with the product and going back to Brita.  Brita may not filter as well, but I'm not really afraid of my tap water, which has tested to be pretty safe and good quality, so I'm not really sure what all I'm filtering out anyway.  A friend has the PUR 18-cup dispenser that sits out on the counter, and refills a smaller pitcher for the fridge from that; the PUR dispenser has a great design, though probably not as good a filter as ZW.\nUpdate 1/29/14:  Ended up replacing with the PUR 18-cup dispenser and I'm VERY happy with the PUR model!  Been using the PUR for 6 months or so and couldn't be more pleased.  I'll have to write a review for that, five stars!";Good Filter, Bad Pitcher, Going Back to Brita
75;99.0;1.0;5.0;I first bought a Brita from Costco and it leaked at the bottom so I returned it.  I saw that they were cheaper online and was going to try again online when I came across the ZeroWater.  Reviews looked good, price was right...  Of course, I tested my water first thing and got a reading of 600+ (Bastrop Co, TX).  I was very disappointed to read that I could expect the filter to last for a whopping 8 gallons before I would have to replace it. Excluding the cost of the pitcher, that's about $2/gal! Well, I figured the water coming out of my refrigerator had a count of 400+ and that tasted fine so I didn't REALLY have to change my filter when it read 10 - or did I?  My ZeroWater filtered water currently has a reading of 61 and it is very SOUR tasting.  I can't even drink it and will have to replace the filter at only 61.  That seems a bit ridiculous to me. The water doesn't taste that bad at 600+.  With a freah filter, it tastes great, but who can afford to switch them out that often.  My sister, who has a Brita, stayed with me for a couple of months and never changed her filter.  It may not have been as pure, but what good is purity if you can't drink it?  I'm considering ditching the filter part of the pitcher and just having an expensive juice pitcher.;Sour water!
80;100.0;1.0;5.0;At first I was very happy with this product, but after a few weeks the water tasted sour and nasty! The filtered water was testing 0, and now it is testing 011, which suggests I need to change the filter. It tastes so bad I can't drink it, and I certainly won't waste my money on a new filter every month. Very disappointed!;Tasted sour after a few weeks!
81;101.0;1.0;5.0;"I bought this ZeroWater pitcher after watching so many raving reviews on TV. It claims it's much better than PUR or Brita. Well, since it came with a TDS meter I decided to try it out.... to see if it's as good as it advertises. When I first bought it and tried it, I had to call customer service. I said I poured water into the reservoir but it's not filtering! She told me that there might be water bubbles blocking the passageway and told me to ""burp"" the filter. I was then instructed to use a paperclip to puncture holes in the filter to help the filtration process and use a glass to pour tap water into the reservoir instead of running the water directly under the faucet. I thought man, this is a lot of work but if I get good tasting fresh clean water it will be worth it.\n  Guess what? The water tasted great! Just like bottled filtered water. However, 3 weeks later I noticed the clean pure taste was gone and tasted a lot more like my tap water. Roughly 5 days after that I got a VERY sour, rancid, and bitter taste to the water. I used the TDS meter and it said 005. I can't believe it, the TDS reading was only 005 yet it tastes worse than my tap water at 375! I emailed customer service and they said the design of the filter was to filtrate 18,000 ppm and once that gets used up the TDS reading should be a 006 and if you don't change it you will get a fishy/sour taste to the water. Well, that makes no sense to me. First of all, the reading was only a 005 not 006 and already tasted rancid. Another thing, 005 is still close to 000 and why would 005 filtered water taste worse than 375 TDS tap water.... and why would there be a sour smell to the water? I never had that problem with Brita. When it was time for me to change my Brita filters I NEVER got a sour or fishy smell. Maybe the water tasted more like tap water at the end of the filter's life but I NEVER got this rancid smell like I did with ZeroWater.\n  I decided to return my ZeroWater pitcher and filters and go back to Brita. I really tried to like ZeroWater and was willing to go through the hassle and pay extra money for good clean water. However, the sour smell was the last straw. That is a VERY BAD PRODUCT. DO NOT BUY. Consider this a severe warning!!";Great at first.... terrible 3 weeks later
82;102.0;4.0;5.0;When I first used my new pitcher, I loved being able to see that there were zero particles in my water.  The filtered water tasted very fresh and pure.  The filter was easy to install.  After about three weeks, I checked the water again, and it was still 000.  And then about week later, I found this fishy smell in my glass.  I searched out my ice cubes, thinking it was maybe coming from the freezer.  Nope.  I checked my faucet water, not there either.  It was a mystery.  So a day or so passes, and the stench of fish is overwhelming.  I look online, and there were numerous posts about this filter smelling like fish as it ages.  What an appalling odor!  When I read it was because it was time to change filters, I immediately bought a new one and made the change.  But first, I had to wash all parts of the pitcher, and use a sink of soapy bleach water to soak my tea kettle to get the stench out!  Why the heck can't the manufacturer warn you about this??  My tap water tests at 257, which is high, so my filters will not last more than a month.  You can bet I will be checking weekly.  You want to avoid this odor at all costs.  When I did install the new filter, I tested the water and it registered 17, not 000 as it should have been.  I added more water to drain, and noticed there was a small leak around the seal.  I had screwed the filter in a little too far and the seal was crushed in one tiny area.  I loosened it a little, and now it is fine, and the water is testing at 000.  I will keep the pitcher, now that I know what to expect.  I was, however, about ready to toss the whole thing in the river, because that's where such a horrible smell belongs!  So, warning....check your water often, and change filters before you get THE SMELL.;I am pleased, with an exception...
88;103.0;3.0;5.0;"Beware - if you buy the filters for this thing one at a time, they're about $15.00 apiece. Even when I bought 8 filters at once, they were still almost $11.00, and that was with free shipping.\n The instructions say that when the filtered water gets to an ""8"", you should change the filter. As hard as the water is where I live, I'd have to change the filter about every 2 -3 weeks. It's cheaper to buy bottled water.\nIf you're lucky enough to live where the water is a little less solid, this pitcher far outperforms any other filter out there. The water where I live is undrinkable - I won't even give it to my dog without filtering it first. This pitcher will make it taste every bit as good as bottled water.";Expensive to keep
94;104.0;1.0;5.0;I have the pitcher at work, so if I leave water in the pitcher overnight, or especially over the week-end, it does *not* taste clean & fresh, it has a plastic taste to it from the pitcher.  I have other water filter pitchers from other manufacturers and that is not the case with them.;Water does not remain tasting fresh.
96;105.0;4.0;5.0;I am a water snob.  I don't like buying bottled water because it's such a waste, both of money and materials for all that packaging.  This conflicts with my taste for fine water, as I'm forced to drink tap water most of the time.  (Oh, and I'm cheap so I don't want to buy and upkeep an RO system).\n\nHowever, now I have this pitcher/filter.  I filter some water, use it to fill up my 32oz Contigo water bottle, and I have at least several hours worth of RO-quality water.\n\nAnother neat bonus: it comes with a little device that measures the quality of your water.  It's nice to test some tap water, then filter that same water and test it again to see the drastic difference.  But it's kind of a moot point because the TASTE is so night and day different that you don't really need objective proof that the filter is doing its job.\n\nThe only thing that's irritating about it, as others have mentioned, is the design of how the filter hangs down into the bottom of the pitcher.  You literally can't fill the pitcher up with filtered water as it is--the filter is submerged and the water doesn't finish moving through the filter at the bottom.  You have to either have another empty container to fill part by part with filtered water, or lift up the top section of the pitcher and turn it sideways so it's resting in an elevated position above the reservoir, letting more water drain from the filter.  I'd rather they just made the whole thing taller so you could actually take advantage of all the space in the reservoir without having to resort to these tactics.;Produces water that tastes like bottled/RO

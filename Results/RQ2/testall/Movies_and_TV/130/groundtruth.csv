4;1.0;5.0;7.0;One of the funniest movies I've ever seen. 4 hours with the same dirty joke told by close to 100 different comedians. The movie itself as seen in the theaters lasted about 90 minutes. The disc has 4 hours of videos. . The scenes with Sarah Silverman and Gilbert Gottfried are absolutely hilarious. It includes scenes from everyone from Jon Stewart to Family Guy The Smothers Brothers to Whoopee Goldberg, Howie Mandell to George Carlin and Phyllis Diller to Bill Murray. Great entertainment for a bachelor party.;A Dirty Jike Retold
3;2.0;5.0;44.0;"I saw this film at a college theater in Ann Arbor, because I knew it would never come to the area where I live. It is the funniest and filthiest documentary ever made, about the funniest and filthiest joke ever told. One hundred comedians either tell the joke or comment on it or both. It's been an ""in-thing"" among comedians for years, and now at last it's out there for all to see. If your tolerance for scatalogical, sick, perverted humor is not high, don't even try to see it. It takes a strong stomach to listen to the joke as it becomes ever more depraved, but if you can take it, your sides will ache from laughter before it's over.";Not for Everyone--but perfect for the right folks
2;3.0;5.0;34.0;"I like this film for what it says about free speech and the face/state of comedy in America.\n\nBy any measure the language is rough and the joke appalling, but only if you think of this as something *other than* comedy one-upmanship. My only complaint with the film is that it wasn't long enough and some comics were just face time (like Jon Stewart and Chris Rock). Here's my highlight reel:\n\nBEST DELIVERY Martin Mull, laid back and hilarious. Taylor Kegan, smooth and articulate.\n\nDADS TALKING DIRTY: Andy Richter and Doug Stanhope with their infant sons. Funny and freakishly disturbing.\n\nMOST OBNOXIOUS: Mario Cantone, Andy Dick\n\nVETERAN GREATS: Jay Marshall (who also has a terrific joke in the end credits) and Pat Cooper, the misanthrope.\n\nCOSMIC COMIC CHICKS: Carrie Fisher, Sarah Silverman, Wendy Liebman\n\nNICE TOUCHES: The Joe Franklin-Sarah Silverman ""relationship""; the very last comic in the end credits (can't say who he/she is, or I'd spoil it for you); comments by journalist Frank DiGiacomo; all the extra goodies on the DVD version.\n\nBIGGEST SURPRISE: How the ""same"" joke can be told so differently yet reveal so little about the comic.";An Homage to Free Speech
106;4.0;5.0;23.0;This movie is not a joke. It an unpretentious treatise on comedy. And the joke is performed by masters. It's the comedic equivalent of opera...majestic variations on a deceptively simple theme. If that weren't enough, it's a huge step forward for freedom of expression. Now how many movies can you say all of that about?;NOT JUST ANOTHER DIRTY JOKE
96;5.0;5.0;22.0;This is a great, hysterical movie. You can watch it over and over and will still laugh out loud. It has a great variety of different types of comedians and different styles of joke telling. It also has some interesting insight into the behind the scenes of the comedy world. It has something for everybody, unless, of course, you are easily offended.;Tears-in-Your-Eyes Funny
110;6.0;5.0;20.0;"I believe it is misleading to label the content ""offensive"".  Every person who has seen or might see this movie has heard each of the off-color words before.  In today's day and age we should be somewhat numbed to them by now.  To paraphrase Lenny Bruce, a particular word only has the power to offend us if we allow it to do so.  A word is just a word.  It is a meaningless sound in itself.\n\nBut it is the spirit, attitude, and context in which it is used that suggests something more.  It isn't important that someone may find a few words or phrases in ""The Aristocrats"" to be offensive.  The point is that the joke-telling allows the teller to nurture an atmosphere of outrageousness and no-holds-barred freedom from perceived boundaries of good taste (which is a pliable and oft-shifting boundary anyway).\n\nI am a huge fan of most of the comics in this film, and I was delighted that some of the lesser-known comics had the best bits in the film, Dana Gould in particular.\n\nI hope that the large majority of the population is offended and turned off by this film.  Why?  Because it makes the ""enlightened"" rest of us feel superior to them because we aren't behaving like sticks-in-the-mud who simply don't get the joke and miss the whole freakin' point.\n\nWe laugh hard at this film because we aren't supposed to.  We aren't supposed to condone this kind of outrageous freedom of speech in this rather repressive culture we live in.  But the fact that we can and do laugh at it is reassurance that we still want to celebrate things that challenge us.\n\nIn my review of ""Waiting For Guffman"" several years ago I labeled that movie as ""the barometer of funny"" (or ""barometer of humor"", or whatever) --- you can gauge a person's sense of humor by how they respond to that kind of humor, sort of a litmus test.  ""The Aristocrats"" is the same thing -- I will use it as a litmus test to gauge other peoples' sense of humor.";"It's not ""offensive"" - it's OUTRAGEOUS!!!"
105;7.0;5.0;19.0;An utterly hilarious movie that had me snorting with tears rolling down my face.  Good thing I wasn't drinking milk or it would have been squirting out my nose!\n\nYes, it is horribly disgusting, sickening, and grotesque.  Yes, it involves people talking about utterly disgusting & despicable acts.  Yet, it raises several intellectual points.\n\n1.  The entire movie is people talking about taboo subjects in a humorous manner.  Are you offended?  Why?  Why not?  This is an excellent example of free speech!\n\n2.  Why is it funny?  Why are you laughing so hard?  You analyze the nature of comedy.\n\n3.  A hundred different people tell the same joke in different ways and they all generate laughs.  It is definitely the violinist and not the violin.\n\nBUY THIS MOVIE!;Hilarious expression of Freedom of Speech & the nature of Comedy!
0;8.0;5.0;19.0;"NOTE: based on an in-theater viewing\n\nThat's right.  I genuinely thought I would vomit.\n\nI was laughing that hard.\n\nYes.  The editing could've been better.  Yes, it's missing some A-list talent.  Even so, I spent more than half of the movie actively laughing.  Maybe it's that I'm 22 and enjoy vulgar humor.\n\nIf you don't enjoy vulgar humor, don't watch the condemned movie, and spare me the fornicating sanctimony.\n\nIt's as vulgar as advertised.  YOU HAD TO KNOW IT WAS COMING.\n\nEven so, I thought it was quite funny and interesting.  As mentioned by others, Drew Carey's ""punchline to the punchline"" is enjoyable.  Gilbert Gottfried is as funny explaining some of the physical mechanics of another comedian's telling as he is telling it himself.  Seeing Bob Saget tell it was a priceless contrast--his image and the images he evoked.\n\nRegardless--if you can handle the content and enjoy offensive humor, it's as good as (or better than) you likely expect.\n\nIf you don't like that stuff--clearly not the choice for you.";I thought I would vomit.

And WHOA! Man, are some of these guys hilarious. And we take this footage and we edit it as horribly as possible. It might almost be unwatchable when my unpaid friends and I are done editing it. We'll use up to four different camera angles for their faces, and switch between these rapidly. Eight seconds max per angle. No real purpose. We just don't have any confidence in our material so we're going to want to entertain viewers somehow.\n\n""But the real kicker? Not once will I show this joke- the joke about which the whole movie is based- not once will I show the joke the whole way through. Perhaps, through all the scattered clips you might get near a complete telling of the joke- but only with a handful of these guys. And remember, these are professional comedians- George Carlin, Jeffrey Ross, Chris Rock, Bob Saget, Phyllis Diller- so they know how to tell a joke. They know timing, they know how to build momentum, anticipation, I mean they are the masters of their craft. But forget that. We're just gonna show the jokes all jumbled up. Mix them in with this and that. After all, the only way viewers won't get bored is if we are constantly inserting blowhard commentary.\n\n""I mean, we're even going to get Gilbert Godfried's legendary telling of the joke at Hugh Heffner's Friar's Club Roast, and we're not even going to let that material breathe. Don't get me wrong, we will get a bunch of comedians to discuss the ins and outs of Godfried's version. We're just not going to bother to really show what they are talking about.\n\n""Then, since we're going to have all this space to fill, we'll get these comedians to all share the same meaningless observations. Eight or nine will compare the joke to jazz improv. No -better- they'll all liken it specifically to John Coltrane. Then, with all the second-rate comedians, we're going to give these guys the opportunity to speculate on the enduring charm of dirty humor. Really make them feel like viewers believe these guys have something worthy to say. Then, we're going to have everyone else just go on about how everyone else in the movie would tell the joke.\n\n""And to top it all off there won't be any organization to the material and we're going to give Paul Reiser too much screen time.""?\n\n""Sounds  terrible!"" the talent agent says.

101;10.0;5.0;16.0;The Aristocrats gives you an inside look at the world of comedy and will show you a side of the comic world where few have ever gone.  This is destined to be a classic. Can't wait for the next version with even more comedians.  Penn Jillette's analysis is insightful, intelligent, truthful and funny.;A must have movie for your collection
104;11.0;5.0;16.0;"Once I saw the list of stars from the world of comedy and entertainment my first thought was, ""Sign me up this has got to be good!"" and I certinly was not disapointed. It has the genre of back in the day when you would have killed somebody to get in to see the rat pack because everyone wanted to be in on the fun. That is exactly what you experience in this film. I was lucky enough in my life time to see several renditions of the Aristocrats in the green room of comedy clubs and its like Jillette and Provenz acted as the history channel of what all of the comics have in common. The one that said it the funniest was, Billy the Mime! if you don't see this there is a slice of comedy history missing in your life.";was Penn Jillette ever better?
97;12.0;5.0;15.0;The Aristocrats exceeded my highest expectation. This movie is not about a joke, but about a group of people. It provides a rare of glimpse into a community of exuberantly passionate modern-day story tellers, aka comedians. Each person brings his or her own flavor to the telling, making for a hilarious, insightful, and even touching tribute to man's ability to poke fun at himself (and his fellow man). And yes, this movie is **** your pants funny!!!!;Masterfully executed!!!!
98;13.0;5.0;15.0;A true comedy classic!\n\nThis film breaks down comic boundaries in a very smart, insightful, and ingenious way.\n\nI laughed so hard it hurt.\n\nThe Aristocrats is a visionary piece that will be remembered as the maverick comedy movie of its time.;Genius!!!
102;14.0;5.0;15.0;"Sure, this movie didn't have any penguins in it, but it didn't stop it from being the most engaging, thoughtful, funny documentary of 2005.  This a movie full of humor and love.  If you want to know what cats like George Carlin, Gilbert Gottfried, Andy Dick and Sarah Silverman have in common with the likes of Stan Getz, Sarah Vaughn, Gerry Mulligan and Shelly Manne, you'll get it when you see this movie.  And if nothing else, you'll come away from it having the phrase ""rusty trombone"" in your vocabulary forever.";BRILLIANT!
103;15.0;5.0;15.0;I couldn't laugh for weeks after my friend died. I couldn't laugh for years after my mother died. But wow, I couldn't stop laughing when I saw the Aristocrats, and it felt like none of that other stuff ever happened. For once I laughed with every pore, cell, and microbe.\n\nThis movie is the only one that made me want to run back out to the ticket booth and buy seats for the rest of the day...to see all the parts I couldn't hear/see when I was teary-eyed and gasping at the greatest joke-tellers of the world.\n\nI later took other friends.. from the age of 21 to 83, (yes, I love em all)..who all and I mean ALL had versions to tell me after the movie. We still do one-liners just in goofy moments. It's a classic. -- this is one of those movies that will stand the test of time.\n\nAnd.. as a comedienne, I couldn't have been more proud of Lisa Lampanneli's take on what comedy is!\n\nALL stars, ALL aces...ALL worth it! I can't wait to see the DVD extras!!;Spit Takes in the Popcorn
108;16.0;5.0;15.0;"""The Aristocrats"" is a rare film in that it is absolutely brilliant and  outrageously funny at the same time.  It's not about the joke, it's about the art of joke telling and improv. The editing is superb, so you never get tired of hearing the different variations. In fact,  just when  you catch your breath , wipe the tears from your eyes and settle back in your chair...you can't help but buckle over with belly laughs again. It's simply hilarious from beginning to end.\n\nIf you can only buy a few films a year..this should be one of them. I've seen it 5 times and each time I laugh harder and pick up on something new. I've never enjoyed a film more.\n\nHollywood should sit up and take notice. If more people put out movies like Paul Provenza and Penn Jillette.....Hollywood wouldn't be in the slump that it's in right now.";Brilliant!
27;17.0;1.0;14.0;"The few minutes devoted to Gilbert Gottfried's telling of this dumb joke are perfectly hilarious, but not enough to redeem what is arguably the most vulgar and un-funny movie ever made.  The Aristocrats has so many faults one barely knows where to begin.  For starters, there are few things less amusing than having humor explained, it either works or it doesn't.  (Hearing musicians talk about music is also painful, and listening to actors talk about acting is torture.)  Next, as a class, comedians tend to be neurotic, juvenile, and self-indulgent, even the clever ones will go to any extreme to get the attention and approval they desperately crave.  The Aristocrats celebrates these inadequacies by encouraging them to top one another with increasingly grotesque tellings of one simple joke.  The result is a non-stop barrage of sludge that will make you feel like taking three showers afterwards.\n\nThe missing piece here is obvious, though not obvious enough to be seen by directors Provenza and Jillette.  It is simply this; comedy depends on surprise, an obscure perspective that resonates something inside the listener in a way that s/he did not expect.  The surprise of encountering filth comes only from it being out of context, there is nothing inherently funny about filth.  Jokes don't get funnier by getting dirtier; they become more offensive and revolting.  Toilet humor, and humor relying on sexual depravity, is not only the least funny type of humor there is, it is the last refuge of the comedian too lazy to actually create and hone real humor.\n\nThe premise of this film is that we are getting an insider's look at how comedians entertain each other.  As loathsome as this idea is, there may indeed be truth to it.  If true, it only reinforces our worst suspicions about comedians.  While truth must always be paramount, not everything true must be placed on a billboard.  Eating sausage is one thing, watching 90 minutes filmed in an abattoir is quite another.  Spare yourself.";A New Low
56;18.0;1.0;14.0;What is truly disgusting is the way these smarmy, smug and self-satisfied comics, many who are otherwise quite talented, smirk and laugh about how funny they imagine themselves to be. (Except for Red Skelton, I always thought comedians weren't supposed to laugh at their own jokes!)\n\nThis incredibly amateurishly shot and edited film might be viewed with some interest as a distasteful inside look at the incestuous world of celebity sycophancy, but discriminating lovers and purveyors of filthy humor are sure to be disappointed.;Disgusting, but not for the reasons advertised.
72;19.0;1.0;14.0;"A self-aggrandizing exercise in comedic narcissism, where nearly every comic thinks what he/she is saying is a whole lot funnier than you do.  Falsely advertised as 100 comics delivering the same joke in individual ways, the film is actually a half-baked documentary consisting of an endless stream of talking heads endlessly and shallowly pontificating on the implicit philosophical and/or sociological underpinnings of an amusingly obvious dirty joke.  Some are sincere, others sarcastic, all (to various degrees) annoying.  Even the footage of those who make a genuine effort is so manically chopped up that their earnest delivery is irreparably compromised.\nFortunately (and probably for the sake of their own careers), some refuse to actually tell the joke (bless you Don Rickles, Jon Stewart and Phyllis Diller), while others spit it out so generically (Emo Philips, for one, who is normally ingeniously eccentric) that it is simply embarrassing.  Even Gilbert Gottfried's Hugh Hefner Roast footage (which, face it, is the sole reason this thing was even made) is truncated, for reasons unknown.  Rather than being allowed to judge it for ourselves, we instead get a half-dozen or so commentators telling us how earth-shattering it was (speaking of which, is Hugh Hefner the world's most humorless man, or what?).\nThe whole film is like when someone tells a long-winded joke with far too much exposition then either screws up or forgets the punch line.  A lot of empty, self-indulgent babble with no pay-off.  For the real deal, rent or purchase Gilbert Gotffried's ""Dirty Jokes"" dvd, which is exponentially more rewarding.";I Would Like to Have My 89 Minutes Back

The Market Street Cinema in Little Rock showed it for a month.\n\nThe cast list is enough to make it worth your while, but it's the concept that makes this thing a stunner.  Watching verbal jazz with no smoke in the air?  Priceless.\n\nIgnore the weird cover; the idea that there is more material, more to study, more to laugh about, makes buying The Aristocrats the best glimpse into the minds and hearts of the best performers out there.\n\nIt's the weirdest study guide you'll ever see.";Played for a month in Arkansas
11;21.0;1.0;12.0;"As someone who grew up in a house with a razor strap hung on the wall, it is quite possible that jokes about child abuse might resonate in another way. Take, for example, Gilbert Gottfried's casual reference to ""child fisting""...as someone who now works with children who have been sexually abused, I can assure you that this type of violation of infants and children by family members does indeed happen. And forcibly inserting an adult's clenched fist into either a child's rectum or vagina creates an amazing amount of trauma, both psychological and physical. For example - because the orifice of the child is too small to accommodate the object (in this case, a fist), the tissues usually tear, and there is often a tremendous amount of bruising and bleeding (yes indeed, Gottfried, as the movie said... ""there will be blood""). The victim is then violated in two senses - physically, and also psychologically, because this has happened by someone the child trusted. Children who have experienced this type of abuse have a much harder time making safe connections with adults later, and often become violent themselves. Feeling uncomfortable yet??\n\nYou can't just ""casually"" toss off these jokes and not consider the pain that they might cause to the unwitting. I can see the appeal of this type of humor to a very (VERY) select audience - but packaging the DVD in a lighthearted way with a cute dog and abstract references to ""dirty jokes"" is simply not fair. I suspect that most of the comedians featured in The Aristocrats have had very little exposure to the true outcomes, messiness, and extreme complications of sexual abuse - or they have been abused themselves and are working it out in a subversive way through their humor. This is an extremely blue movie, and a day later, I still have tears in my eyes thinking about photographs I have seen of the physically abused and the poignant stories they have told me...";There's another way to look at this...
107;22.0;5.0;13.0;Filthy vile disgusting incredibly funny examination of free speech. No nudity. No sex. No violence. Just words. Except of course when Billy the Mime does his take on this classic joke. Gilbert pushed the envelope daring to punch holes in the human psyche by being the first to turn tragedy in to comedy. To patch up the holes he unleashes The Aristocrats. Laughter heals. Genius. Smart. Funny. There, I said it.;An insiders guide to the ultimate inside joke
59;23.0;1.0;12.0;"This has got to be the worst movie I've seen in recent years. Hands down, one of the least funny movies ever made. A documentary about a joke... interesting, right? That's what I thought. Little did I know...\n\nBasically, you start telling a seriously raunchy joke that includes elements of incest, blood, fecal matter, and anything else you can think of to gross out your most weak-stomached friend. Somehow, you convey that the whole situation is an act. When the person asks you what the act is called at the end of your joke, you simply reply ""The Aristocrats"", which ""is"" the punch line. And for some reason, that's supposed to be funny. It's supposed to be a joke that a comedian can improvise with, and show off their writing sills. It's supposed to convey the art of telling a joke. But I can't think of a more unfunny display of writing ""talent"" than telling this joke. It's simply a gross out joke. It's like laughing at fart jokes, only not as funny. It will have you scratching your head as to why they aren't just telling a regular joke that's actually original.\n\nI do enjoy most of the comedians in the film. At one point or another, they have succeeded in their endeavors. Sadly, this film makes them all far from funny. Don't get me wrong, if you are between the ages of 9 and 13 and just love to hear swearing a explicitly vulgar dialogue, you may love this film. If the ""shock factor"" does a lot for you, you also may enjoy this film. I on the other hand was yawning most of the film. Juvenile humor can be insanely funny when cleverly delivered. But when poorly delivered, it falls flat, which is what the movie suffers from on the whole.\n\nThe other thing that makes this documentary so terrible is the fact that it's 90-minutes long! This could have been easily summed up into a 30-minute special on HBO (and that still would've been too long). I've had countless debates with friends that think this movie is just hilarious. I've yet to get a decent explanation as to why. I've dissected the film from every angle I could possibly think of. It just sucks.";About as funny as a kick in the nuts
95;24.0;5.0;12.0;"This is an amazing movie.  It's not about a joke.  It's an exploration into the structure of the comic mind.  It's a master class in character.  Some people will never ""get"" this joke or this movie.  Some people will never get past the language.  Many people will find that this is the funniest movie they have ever seen.\n\nIf, for even a moment, you have ever worried that ""The Chicken Crossing the Road"" might get hurt this movie isn't for you.  It's a movie about a dirty joke that isn't about the joke or the language.  It's about friendship, camaraderie, and freedom.";Insight into Comedy
6;25.0;5.0;8.0;"The subject of this documentary film is one joke with the punch line, ""The Aristocrats"". This joke is a legendary old joke that allows comedians to improvise almost endlessly on the set up, in which the goal is to compete to see who can invent the most disgusting, filthy, sick, twisted, scatalogical, gross, perverse, nauseating, evil and bizarre tale imaginable. It's been a sort of professional challenge among comedians to see who can go the farthest and break the most taboos, and you'll see a lot of outstanding efforts that more than achieve that goal.\n\nIf you can deal with that, then this might be the funniest DVD you'll ever own. Stellar comedians such as Robin Williams, Penn & Teller, Michael Palin, and Drew Carey, a host of great newer comics, and even older ones like David Brenner and Galleger, and many more are featured, and the editing is brilliant. One surprise is that perhaps the most twisted and filthy (and hilarious) versions of ""The Aristocrats"" presented in the entire film is by Mr. Clean himnself, Bob Sagat.\n\nAnd on top of being side-splittingly funny, the film is a very interesting insight into how comedians disect and analyse a joke, what makes a joke work, or flop, and other inside glimpse into the art of comedy.\n\nJust a great film.";Not for prudes, but quite possibly the funniest documentary ever
35;26.0;1.0;11.0;Rented this movie expecting to laugh.  Didn't think it was funny at all.  The camera jumps from person to person as they sit in chairs and describe the first time they heard this raunchy joke, that really just isn't funny to begin with.  I kept expecting the commentary to stop, and the movie to begin, but it never did.  It got real old real fast.  Tried fast farwarding to see if there was anything else to see, but there wasn't.  I don't mind swearing or dirty jokes, when they are funny, but this was just nastiness for the sake of nastiness. Shocking yes, but funny no.  After you hear the twentieth person say the same thing, it's no longer even shocking, just annoying.  I wouldn't even recommend renting it.  Save your money.;boring, choppy, and repetitive
100;27.0;4.0;11.0;"I am able to both tolerate and enjoy blue humor, so nothing in this movie was out of bounds for me.  What made my experience with this presentation more entertaining was the fact that many in the audience for whatever reason had no idea what they were in for.  I sat in a theater surrounded by couples, singles, old and young and was able to not only see the screen, but the reactions of the crowd around me.  These reactions made this movie more enjoyable for me.  It was almost a social experiment.  While I'm sure the DVD will be great, especially with the extra material, it is my opinion that to get the most from it, you need to watch it in a group of dissimilar people.  The ""squirm factor"" of those that are shocked is important to feel the strength of this movie.\n\nThat said, I will own this DVD to have two things.  The ""South Park"" clip, which will never allow you to see those little scamps the same again, and the sublime performance of Sarah Silverman, who rather than simply telling the joke in the third person, became one of the Aristocrats relaying her past experience in the group and hitting on a realization about what she went through.\n\nAgain, watch this movie in a group, and be sure to include people that might not have the exact same type of humor that you do.  Watch for the squirming and enjoy.";needs to be seen in a group...
1;28.0;4.0;11.0;"This movie is extremely difficult to review because of most people think it is. Most people think this is a movie about a very, very, very dirty joke. That it's a barrage of profanity that only the immature would find funny, but it's far from that. You will get 20-30 minutes of comedians telling parts of the joke, followed by 10-20 minutes of analysis from comedians about the joke.\n\nOther reviewers say they've walked out of this because of the obscenity, and certainly that's true. If you are easily offended or don't like crude language, this movie is NOT for you. You'll never make it past all the obscenity to truly see the movie.\n\nIf you are looking for a movie that'll have you rolling in the aisles, this movie is NOT for you. As one of the comedians in the movie note, the joke ""The Aristocrats"" is a joke that no respectable comedian would tell. The joke is so predictable, the punchline so obvious (and well known), that it's a bad joke.\n\nWhat this movie IS, is a documentary. It's about how comedians keep each other amused with this joke.  Indeed more than a few comedians in this film talk about groups of comedians in hours-long sessions doing this joke, one upping each other. It's about how the joke has evolved over time and how its obscenity and bad taste has also evolved. It's about how this joke is adapted by different people for their audience.\n\nAnd that is why this movie is so difficult to review. It's not what most people think it is.

32;31.0;1.0;10.0;"I have a sick sense of humor and love a dirty joke, but this film is a complete waste of time and electricity....and $4.23. In my opinion this documentary is not shocking, hilarious, clever or philosophical, as some reviewers remarked. It was, well, it just is. It doesn't even merit a half of a star, let alone a whole one.\n\n We consumers were willing to pay for and watch with open mind this drivel;the joke's on us.";I want my 86 minutes back

The problem is that this movie simply isn't funny.  Even poop jokes get old after you've heard the same one 10 times in a row.  Maybe people like me ""just don't get it"" because we're not smart (or funny or creative or open-minded or edgy) enough.  I say, don't waste your money, unless you have teenage boys in the house.  THEY might appreciate the humor, since they're young and haven't already been overexposed to bad standup routines.";I kept waiting for the funny part.
55;33.0;4.0;10.0;A lot of people seem to be let down that this movie doesn't make them laugh.  They're missing the point.  The movie isn't a comedy, it's a documentary.  It's about comics, so it's bound to make you laugh a couple of times, but that's not the goal of the film.  The film's purpose is to give the backstory on a joke that is almost like a secret handshake among stand up comedians, while at the same time allowing you to glimpse just how warped some of these people are.\n\nThere's no doubt that it takes a special type of person to become a comic.  Being funny isn't good enough.  Someone has to be driven and willing enough to go in front of a crowd and face humiliation night after night.  They probably spend half their lives on the road in tiny clubs.  It's no surprised that they're a little warped, and nothing illustrates this better than The Aristocrats joke.\n\nThe joke itself is just a comic talking about a family act where each person commits the most unspeakable acts.  The punch line is that the group is called the Aristocrats.  It's not a funny joke.  The humor comes from the way it's told.  How far will the comic go in setting up the punch line?  How can they get more disgusting and over-the-top than the previous comic?  How can they make it their own?\n\nThis film isn't for anyone who's easily offended since the humor often deals with sex, incest, and bodily functions that people don't normally talk about.  But if you're not too sensitive and you want to get a look at the mind of a comedian, it's worth checking out.  If you have a favorite comic, chances are they're in this movie....;Interesting Look at the Comic Club
64;34.0;5.0;10.0;This is the kind of movie that Walt Disney would have made if he were alive today. Heart warming, sentimental, with a deep message that resonates with that child that is within all of us. The dialogue is sometimes overly philosophical but the message still gets through: Life is good....people are great...and everything is as it should be.\n\nI especially recommend this movie if you are a regular churchgoer, you can really learn alot of expressions here that would liven up any Sunday School Class.;Finally, a movie for the whole family.
71;35.0;5.0;10.0;I can't believe anyone didn't laugh their butts off at this movie.  I know comedy is subjective, but there is something for everyone to enjoy in this movie - except for the overly sensitive, of course.\n\nIt's more than just funny though - it's a genuine documentary about the creative process, the craft of comedy, and an incredible journey into the behind the scenes world and community of stand up comedians that we never get to see with such authenticity and intimacy.\n\nIt's smart, challenging, thought provoking, and is a completely new form of documentary. It is just as entertaining as it is educational.  I was really surprised - I suspected the hype would be just that - I mean how can anything llive up to the hype I've heard about this movie?  Well, it exceeded it.  I have watched this dvd three times already, got more out of it each time, and can't wait to watch it with more friends again.\n\nAnd the extras are plentiful - and each one unique.  Billy the Mime has an extra that is not to be believed.  I never thought I would say a mime was brilliant, but Billy is.;This movie is amazing!
73;36.0;1.0;10.0;Let me preview this by saying I see comedians every weekend and love documentaries.  This is the worst of both.  The joke is the most offensive one I've ever heard.  How could anyone think this is funny?  If you think pedophelia, incest, defecation, rape and abuse is funny, this is the movie for you.  I was so excited to get this movie because of all the reviews and it was complete waste of money.  Laughing at raping your seven year old daughter, or your children performing sexual acts on each other.  I'm throwing it away.;Worst movie I've seen
12;37.0;2.0;9.0;"This movie is not offensive- at least not in the way the producers want it to be.  Most of us have an ""anything goes"" attitude towards entertainment these days, and accordingly, broadcasting something as ""OFFENSIVE!"" has just become a tired combination of marketing device and transparent attempt to appear a First Amendment champion.  Continued use of profanity and bathroom humor isn't all that funny if you're older than 13- it's initially kind of amusing, then puerile, then pathetic.  Comics tend to be attention-starved anyway, and therefore take any joke further and longer than you or I would care to see.  Case in point: The Aristocrats.\n\nThat aside, I wanted to like this movie.  I loved the premise, that telling a joke is like jazz, in that plenty of artists repeat the same material, but with their own interpretation.  It's the singer (comedian) that resonates, not the song (joke).  However, this film is a one trick pony that long outlives its clever foundation.  I also had a hard time believing that these guys found the joke all that funny themselves; most of the onscreen laughs were due to the chemistry between these old friends, and the audience isn't really a part of the joke a lot of the time.\n\nThe film's novelties provide the most entertaining moments: Kevin Pollack's Christopher Walken imitation, Billy the Mime, Taylor Negron's gay rendition, and a magician who tells the joke via a card trick.  George Carlin was really the only comic who made me laugh with his version of a strict telling of the joke.  On top of everything else, I found the jarring, MTV-style editing and quick camera switches made The Aristocrats even tougher to watch.\n\nWhile we're on the subject, is there anyone worse than Bob Saget?  He can swear as much as he wants, and he's still every bit as annoying and unfunny as when he hosted America's Funniest Videos.  Impossibly, he's even less funny when profane.";I Wanted It To Be So Much Better
15;38.0;2.0;9.0;"How is it possible for a group of filmmakers to gather together more than a hundred of the world's foremost comedians into a single documentary and yet elicit not one genuine laugh in the entire film?  Well, I'm not sure quite how they've accomplished it, but ""The Aristocrats,"" for all its high-priced comic talent, is one seriously unfunny movie.\n\nThe film is built around a supposedly classic joke involving an agent who walks into a producer`s office, declares ""Have I got an act for you!"" and then proceeds to describe that act in terms so lurid that even a convention of Satan-worshipping sailors might have trouble booking it for one of their programs.  When the agent finally finishes his description, the producer asks ""What's the act called?,"" a query which is always followed by the response, ""the aristocrats.""  The object of the joke is for the teller to be as offensive, disgusting and perverted as possible in the lead up to the punch line.  Routinely, the subject matter involves incest, bestiality, pedophilia, violence, urination, defecation and a whole host of other topics not normally broached in polite society.  In what amounts to a talking-heads documentary, ""The Aristocrats"" basically consists of all these great comics running their own variations on this one joke while discussing the iconoclastic function of humor and providing an occasional backstage glimpse into the art of joke telling (I guess that`s where the ""redeeming social value"" aspect comes in).\n\nThe main problem with the movie is not that it is crude, vulgar and disgusting per se, but that it is crude, vulgar and disgusting without being funny.  In fact, after the umpteenth take on the same routine, we sink into a kind of humor-deprived stupor that lasts for almost a full ninety minutes.\n\nHonestly, I appreciate a dirty joke as much as the next fellow, but ""The Aristocrats"" is all dirty and no joke.";a grueling ordeal
31;39.0;1.0;9.0;Fair warning - I won't tell the joke, but I definitely will give away the premise of this movie.  The joke that this movie is based upon is simple, straightforward, and dates from the days of vaudeville.  In it's simplest form, it is a quick set-up, punch line, and rim-shot.  The point of this documentary is that each comedian that has told it over the years has improvised their own details in the middle, and seem to have an ongoing contest to see who can make it the longest and the most disgusting.  If you find bodily fluids, unnatural acts, and cursing as funny as you did when you were an adolescent, then you might actually like this movie.  Otherwise, it's a huge waste of time.;If you've got half a brain, you won't last 15 minutes
36;40.0;1.0;9.0;I bought this dvd with the hope of seeing some of today's funniest comedians telling a raunchy joke. Well you do see that , but after about an hour or so of listening to those same people tell about the first time they heard the joke, the first time they told it, etc...\n\nAll I can say is rent it from the store just to see what the hype is all about, but please don't buy it. BTW I am selling mine on ebay very soon, so it might not be a total loss!;Can we say BORING?
42;41.0;1.0;9.0;"I am staring this reviewing by saying I did not fast forward or stop this film at any time, since I rented it. If I went to see it in a movie theater, I would not have walked out at any time. I write this review having watched the entire film, though I can certainly understand why so many people actually did walk out of the theater when ""The Aristocrats"" premiered. And out of curiosity, I wanted to watch this film, and having watched it all the way through, I am sorry that I did.\nIf it were actually funny, I would be able to appreciate it, admire it, give it credit, and, most importantly, laugh at it. The problem, as all problems with jokes, is if it's not funny, it's just plain pathetic. Yet sometimes pathetic can even be funny, but not this time. It was way over the top, and I know, I know that's the whole point, that these comedians go so far over the top with this ""joke"". It is a game of who's sicker than who, but as the comedians would say it, who's more creative and outrageous than who? How about a game of who's funnier than who? And the winner is...... Nobody!\nDirty jokes can be extremely funny (Drew Carey's 101 Big [Richard] Jokes in the book ""Dirty Jokes And Beer""), but this goes beyond dirty and enters into too sick and overly disgusting territory (as, by the way, it promises to enter and does), and that just does not cut it for me in the humor department. It works in the sad and pathetic department though. I'll give you an example of what other gross-out humor I have found to be funny to an extent... ""Scary Movie"" and somewhat ""Scary Movie 2"", ""There's Something About Mary"", ""National Lampoon's Animal House"", ""Everything You've Always Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask"", and my favorite stand-up concert is ""Eddie Murphy's Delirious"". So, I am not offended by sexual humor in general, it just all depends on what's funny and what's not funny. One of the most unfunny tellings would be from who most people viewed as the best.... Sarah Silverman. Funny? Hmm... Well, if I were hard of hearing and unable to read lips, maybe I could imagine her saying something that would make me laugh. But unfortunately, in this case, I do have my hearing, and I did not even chuckle or so much as smile.\nThe comedians I believe could have made this joke funny are Sam Kinison, Buddy Hackett, Rodney Dangerfield, and possibly, my all-time favorite comedian, Richard Pryor. And wouldn't you know it, all four are no longer alive. But then again, the almost always funny George Carlin is alive, was in this film, and was not funny at all with this material. So, go figure! Actually, George Carlin has said many times before that anything can be funny. It all depends on how you construct the joke. I believe that to be true, but nobody at all in this film constructed this ""joke"" in a way that came across as remotely funny to me.";"The Aristocrats: ""Funny or not funny?"" That is the question. Here is my answer...."
44;42.0;1.0;9.0;This is probably the worst piece of crap I've ever rented. Not becuase it's offensive or shocking in any way (I've pretty much heard it all at this point), but because it is just a bunch of comedians wanking each other off for 86 minutes. The joke is not funny to begin with. Do you really want to hear it 100 or more times in a row? South Park is much funnier and far more clever if you are into humor that is just plain wrong. Most of these comedians have original material that is a lot better as well.;negative two stars... that's two stars less than no stars at all
52;43.0;1.0;9.0;What a disappointment!  This movie could have been really good, but instead it ended up as a terribly-made documentary.  Rather than get to hear the joke (which is in fact quite often very funny) we hear comedians talk about the joke for most of the movie.  These comments are rarely insightful, poorly organized, and terribly, terribly edited.\n\nMany people talk about the funny tellings of the joke, bob saget's, gilbert godfried's, sarah silverman's, yet you never get to even hear them tell the joke straight through.  Rather you hear them talk about telling it, telling parts of it, and then it gets interspersed with other people talking about the joke.  saying the same stuff other people said.  It doesnt make sense to me how a documentary could be made that neve fully shows us what the documentary is about.  The people who tell the joke are funny comedians, but for some reason the camera just doesnt trust these professional to know how to entertain.\n\nIts as if the filmmakers were scared that the joke would get old after a while,that they never even told it the first time.  But instead of getting bored with the joke, you get bored with people talking about it.  Have more confidence in your material!  The footage for this film should have been given to a second-year documentary film student to edit for free.\n\nWhat a shame.  You will be dissapointed,;Funny Joke-Horribly made movie
54;44.0;1.0;9.0;"After about 45 minutes of this film, ""The Aristocrats"" had already reserved a spot on my list for the worst film ever made. I can't even think of the pile of crap that was there before, because this tops it by leaps and bounds. I wasn't offended in the least by this film. And to those ""intelligent"" reviewers out there that claim the we don't ""understand"" the humor; that's just downright ignorant and just plain stupid. Who doesn't ""get"" the joke? An improvisational joke that comedians tell to laugh at themselves pretty much sums it up. Maybe if I was a kid, and fascinated by dirty words, I may have been intrigued. But in no way is this joke funny. This is perhaps the most unfunny joke a person can tell. People act as if impromptu comedy is a brand new form of art. Watch any episode of ""Whose Line Is It Anyway"" and tell me that their jokes ""aren't"" funnier. It's because there is something original and unexpected about their jokes.\n\nThis movie is completely unoriginal; unless you consider extremely vulgar language ""originality"". ""The Aristocrats"" was commonly a inside joke shared between comedians and musicians, etc. You're gonna wish it stayed there. This movie just really, really blows.";An hour and a half of my life I'll never get back

It's not that I'm easily disturbed or shocked by what I heard in the movie, and I realize there are horrible, inhumane things that occur in this world every day that we ignore in our self rightous concervatism; but I still I think it is utterly pointless and idiotic to celebrate the most disgusting, irreverent trash manifested from the minds of otherwise respectable comedians in the name of art, creative expression, and entertainment. Yes, they are brave for exploiting their sick thoughts and airing the most disturbed recesses of their minds, but it simply does not make for good entertainment! I don't know what the hell it is, but It's stupid! It's playground humor to the nth degree, told over, and over, and over, and over, and again; having been designed for a cheep laugh that was spent  the first fifteen minutes of the movie, if at all. I don't care if you're Paul Riser, or Whoopi Goldberg, or Bob fricking Saget for that matter, the joke was not smart,it was totaly stupid, and we all respect you a little less for having heard you stoop to that level.\n\nIf your brand of humor is condusive to an endless barage of bad words, pointlessly disgusting imagery, with countless references to incest and beastiality, this movie is for you.

10;48.0;5.0;8.0;"My husband and I watched ""The Aristocrats,"" he with a faint smile, me howling. That is, until ""Billy the Mime"" came on, when he began laughing uproariously, and I almost passed out from hysterics.\n\nUp to that point, I was laughing away at pretty much everyone, while he shook his head and announced that this was ""white"" humor.\n\n""It's not white humor,"" I replied. ""It's Jewish humor. Or even more precisely, Jewish show-biz humor."" Which means, once we return to basics, that ""The Aristocrats"" is the most American of American humor.\n\n""The Aristocrats"" is not for everyone, but if it's right for you, it's a howler from beginning to end, as are the out-takes, and even the voice-over extras. Some have noted that ""The Aristocrats"" is not for those who dislike foul language. Let me be more precise.  I dislike foul language for its own sake, employed simply to be coarse and vulgar. I find foul language should be reserved for (a) when a hammer hits your finger (b) when comedians at the top of their game know EXACTLY when to use vulgarity, without a single wasted, gratuitous, Def Comedy Jam ""F bomb"" dropped.\n\nWhat is amazing about ""The Aristocrats"" is how perfect the comedians' pitch is  in their retelling of the vulgar joke -- this is a lot of Miles Davis virtuosity and very little Kenny G.\n\nIn addition to ""Billy the Mime,"" my other favorites were Sarah Silverman and the guys who tell ""the Aristocrats!"" joke as Christopher Walken (Kevin Pollack) and Liza Minelli (Mario Cantone).\n\nTaylor Negron was mesmerizing and daring.\n\nKudos to the ventriloquist, the fire jugglers, the card-trick guy, and Matt and Trey of South Park for finding non-linear new ways to present the joke.\n\nGod bless Tom and Dick Smothers, Carrie Fisher, and Drew Carey, for being quietly flawless with the joke and good sports about not taking their clean images too seriously.\n\nThat ""The Aristocrats"" is at times poorly shot only adds to its charm and authenticity. The editing is at times inspired in the interweaving of the performances, and at times less so.\n\nOne quibble -- the editors could have killed the interviews with Eddie Izzard, Bily Connolly and Eric Idle, maybe even Chris Rock, and taken Merrill Markoe's entire joke unedited off the DVD extras and into the main DVD -- that's if they DARED!";"10 stars for ""Billy the Mime"""
17;49.0;1.0;8.0;It's hard to judge a movie when you haven't seen the whole movie. But I just couldn't bring myself to watch it past the first scene. Vulgar jokes don't really bother me, especially if they ARE funny. But the joke seemed to be lost in all the random comments like how a joke is told, how it changes, what it means, etc etc.\n\nUsually the directors goal is trying to capture to audience so they can't pry their eyes away. I had to force myself to watch the first 20 minutes! This was just a waste of film. It could have been maybe a tv special that no one watches. But to spend money actually making a dvd about it? Waste of money, time, and everyone else's life.\n\nThis dvd would only be interesting to maybe an actual comedian. But for the rest of us? Just say no.;I Tried
5;50.0;1.0;5.0;The Aristocrats: 3 out of 10: The joke in the Aristocrats is not funny. (Many comedians on tape admit this outright.) It really is not a joke as much as a Shaggy Dog story. The funny part of a Shaggy Dog story is watching someone squirm who thinks it is a normal joke. The more you can make a (in this case) prude squirm the funnier the raunch is.\n\nThe funniest scene in the movie is Gilbert Gottfried's masterful and legendary telling of the joke at the Fryers Club soon after 9/11. What makes it funny is watching a surprising prudish and confused Hugh Hefner's reaction listening to the joke. (The exact performance would not be as funny if Larry Flynt for example was on the dais. And the filmed performance wouldn't work had not Hefner not been shown in frame.) The Gottfried performance comes late in the film and we are treated to dozens of top comedians wasted telling the same joke sans victim. Moreover, since the audience by this time is intimately familiar with the mechanics of the magic this is true tedium. In addition, most of the comedians telling the joke do so to the camera with no audience in sight. There is an actual reason that most comedy routines are in a concert film style performance before a live audience.\n\nThere is a lot of top-flight talent here. Drew Carey, Robin Williams, George Carlin among others yet it is a mime (Steven Banks) that tells the joke most creativity and Bob Saget who tells the most disgusting version. Honestly, the film shoots its um... Gun much too soon in the feature and nothing removes humor from something faster than explaining it.\n\nThere are some self serving insights about comedy in general and some so called inside stuff that by its very nature isn't but the majority of the film really is dozens of comics telling the same joke over and over again that wasn't all that funny to begin with.;I love Disney Movies
34;51.0;1.0;8.0;I am no prude and I am not easily shocked. This was not funny or shocking but a very badly edited mish-mash of little bits of cuts from a series of interviews.  I could not believe that anyone would have the nerve to actually sell this rubbish.\n\nMy impression is that we are supposed to find just the idea of the underlying joke so funny that we don't actually need to have it told to us.  The sales pitch, if only implied (the producers must have obtained legal opinion as to whether it was a swindle or not), was that the Aristocrats joke would be told by a variety of well-known comedians.

The only redeeming value of this DVD is that aspiring comics might learn a modicum of technique from it. Otherwise, THE ARISTOCRATS is a pauper of a movie and, unless you are into scatological ""humor"", I recommend that you skip this one.";A PAUPER OF A MOVIE

91;62.0;5.0;7.0;The Aristocrats is quite simply a must see movie. It goes beyond the boundaries of typical stand-up comedy and provides viewers a deeper glance in the world of comedy. It's very entertaining to see comedians like Bob Saget, Jason Alexander, and others seemingly out of their element, slinging vulgarities in the context of great comedy.\n\nSome other reviewers have complained that the Aristocrats is more like a movie about comedians just talking about the joke. If that viewer watched more than the first few mintues he/she would know that's not the case. Furthermore, the DVD provides 2 hours worth of bonus features that include the complete joke being told by several individual comedians, if the montage style doesn't tickle your fancy.\n\nThis movie is a heart-attack bringing, convulsing, wheezing, spitting-milk-out-your-nose, heck of a laugh.

20;68.0;1.0;6.0;I've never considered myself a prude. I have given great one liners that had people laughing until tears come to their eyes. But plain stupid vulgarity just goes over my head. Here is the outline: A family goes to a talent agent and states that they have a great family act. The agent tells them that family acts are too cutesy. They beg for 2 minutes to show their act. The family goes into action. The act has sometimes incest, sometimes it's scatological, often both with other weird stuff thrown in. It is over the top as the joke teller's mind can go. I just don't find that kind of humor funny.\n\nPenn and Teller (it's their movie) don't drink nor smoke. They have given me the impression that they try to eat moderately (watching their Showtime series) but to them this is okay. Excuse me, I rather eat unhealty products occasionally than fill my mind with filth. I'm no saint by any means. I just think there is limits on what's funny.;Unless you enjoy warped humor, I suggest staying away from this.
24;69.0;1.0;6.0;I usually find low-brow, potty humor pretty funny.  Where a lot of people would be offended, I usually laugh and feel entertained. For example, while some people may have been upset and disturbed by the violence in Kill Bill, Sin City, etc., I actually loved those films.  As far as comedy goes, I enjoy Dave Chappelle, Howard Stern, etc., even though my wife and others find them offensive.  With that all said, let me warn you that this film actually made me very uncomfortable and I couldn't even watch it anymore after about 30 minutes.  It starts off with the poop and pee jokes you might expect, and then moves on to vulgar sex acts, etc. (And at this point I was still okay with it, even laughing quite a bit).  But after about 20-30 minutes, it starts crossing way over the line and starts going into some very graphic depictions of incest, senseless murder/mutilation, and even a tad of necrophilia.  Okay, if that isn't enough to upset you, then maybe you'll be okay with this movie.  But I was really repulsed when they started carrying the joke too far.  And once you see that the whole point of the joke and the movie is simply that each comedian can improvise on the joke and make it his own, it is no longer entertaining or funny.  Alot of people may disagree with me, but I wouldn't watch this unless you're really immune to the most vulgar and uncomfortable things you can imagine.  Basically, if you can laugh about child molestation, then you're a sicko and this film is for you.  If you don't find that topic funny (like I imagine most people would not either), then do not even take a glimpse of this movie - You'll be sorry you did.;Warning-EXTREMELY AND UNCOMFORTABLY VULGAR!
43;70.0;1.0;6.0;"Smart? Definitely not. Clever? Not in the least. Funny? Absolutely NOT. This has got to be the dumbest movie ever made. This is supposed to make people laugh, right? I can't see how that's possible. This movie epitomizes the word sophomoric in the worst sense of the word. The middle of the joke (the improvised part) is supposed to be where all the magic and ""genius"" comes into play. There's no (real) punchline, there's no twist, there's no laughing. It's just a bunch of comedians ruining there career on film. It's an uneasy movie to watch. It's like watching a trainwreck. When I realized that all 90 minutes were going to be the same, I turned it off after about 50 minutes. My (2) friends that ACTUALLY like the movie just keep saying ""You gotta see the Sarah Silverman and Bob Saget performances. You can't judge it until you see those."" But there was no way I was aout to sit through more agonizing torture. There were honestly more funny moments in ""Saving Private Ryan"". I feel for all the souls that paid money for this film, whether they bought it or rented it. Do yourself a favor.

58;71.0;5.0;6.0;"On the surface, the only thing one can glean from this movie is how to go to jail very, very quickly.\n\nFor those of you that like to think about what makes something funny, you will learn ever so much more.  Yes, this is just 90 minutes about comedians telling/discussing the dirtiest joke of all time (and they mean it.  I like to tell people the joke, but I do not unless I can completely trust them not be disgusted.  As a result, I do not get to tell this joke often.  When I do, however, it is savored.  Like an orange on a nice summer day.)\n\nThe joke involves graphic amounts of sex, feces and a few acts that you have never thought of before, but can immediately recognize as sins against both man and God.  People who can no longer appreciate lowbrow, ""blue"" humor should pass.\n\nFor those of us still left, this movie is pure genius.  Classic comedians such as Robin Williams, George Carlin, Bob Saget (who, by the way, has the best version of this joke,) and more all telling ang talking about the nature of the joke.  It becomes a discussion on humor and how to craft a joke.  Given the protean nature of The Aristocrats, you will begin to see both similarities and differences in each comedian's telling, things that hint at their viewpoints and personalities.\n\nI managed to catch this movie at the theater, and three people walked out during its course.  I was kind of dissapointed by the small number.  This was galvanized by the number of people joining in and laughing so hard, a few fell into the aisle.\n\nThe tagline of ""No sex, no violence, upspeakable obscenity"" is indeed true, but the extent of it is something that cannot really be quantified.  When I warn people that it is THE dirtiest joke they will hear, they either ask to quantify it, or don't believe me.\n\nSo, again, if you cannot seem to enjoy the Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, or half of Fox's Television lineup, pass.  You will not get it.  You will not like it.  For the rest, this is will have a permament place in your collection.";Zen and the art of Humor

However, I wasn't laughing till my side hurt or until tears were running down my face.  In fact, I was nothing but confused.  I mean, I don't get the joke.  Period.  ""The Aristocrats"" is the punchline?  Please, if you're going to spend time retelling a joke...make sure it's a joke worth retelling.  No matter how many variations I hear of this ""flop"" - it's not funny, amusing, or in any way entertaining.

62;73.0;2.0;6.0;"""The Aristocrats"" proves three things you already knew:\n\n1. Whoopi Goldberg isn't funny\n\n2. When comedians stop telling jokes, they immediately stop being entertaining.\n\n3. Nothing is more annoying than someone telling you something is funny before you get a chance to judge for yourself.\n\nYou hear comedians wax poetic about ""The Aristocrats"" so often in Paul Provenza's documentary that it is shocking, and downright annoying, how few times you get to see someone in the film tell their version of the joke without interruption.  The few times you do - Sarah Silverman, a ventriloquist, a mime, and a card magician are all blissfully allowed to tell it from beginning to end - the movie screams with comic genius.  But this is almost never the case.\n\nThe problem with ""The Aristocrats"" is that it feels like a DVD documentary for the film it should have been.  It was clearly edited by two people (Provenza and someone with the hopefully false name Emory Emory) who had no confidence in the audience's attention span.  Case in point: the greatest telling of the joke, by consensus, is Gilbert Gottfried's Friar Club Roast version.  And when it's finally time to see that version of the joke, it's continually interrupted by a stream of talking heads (one of whom isn't even a comedian) telling you how funny and legendary the performance was.  Well, if it was so great, why won't you let me watch the stupid thing?  There are about 2,000 cutaways in the movie, 80% of which are completely unnecessary.  Some shots are just of comics laughing, with no context whatsoever.  This annoyed me to no end.  I've seen episodes of ""Best Week Ever"" that were less hyperactive.\n\nOther potentially great versions also get ruined by the editor's scissorhands - Bob Saget's, Jason Alexander's, and a host of others.  The bottom line?  ""The Aristocrats"" is the first movie to heckle itself.";Let Them Tell the Joke!

Frankly, I reached my limit of the entire premise by that point. This would have been much better as a half-hour special on HBO because beyond that, it's too repetitive.\n\nThe highlight of ""The Aristocrats"" is Kevin Pollak's telling of the joke--as Christopher Walken. One thing the film will show you: there are a lot of professional comedians out there who are really not funny.";Filthy
65;75.0;1.0;6.0;Here's the deal.  They talk about telling the joke, but they only let about 3 or 4 comedians tell it all the way through.\n\nI wanted to see the comedians tell the joke.  This movie is about the telling of the joke and about how comedians feel about telling the joke.\n\nDon't get me wrong, its plenty disgusting in parts, but I really wanted to hear them tell the joke.  It was a waste of money in that respect for me.;They don't tell the joke
66;76.0;5.0;6.0;"A lot has been said about this movie in these pages, and it's probably all true. If you're easily offended, or you're looking for a conventional comedy, you will probably dislike this movie. If, however, the power of words is limited to the power *you* give them, there is a lot to find in The Aristocrats.\n\nThose who have written before me have said a lot about the humor in this movie. It, too, is probably true. As might be expected from any collection of so many comics, with so many different styles, from so many different backgrounds, some bits will have you gasping for air while others may fall flat. Like most entertainment, that's a matter of taste and it's hardly worth arguing.\n\nBut there's another aspect to his movie that really deserves attention. This movie swings. The joke around which this movie is centered is like a comedy version of a jazz standard. It has been interpreted by many talents, much like any standard, but the documentary itself is even more interesting than its subject.\n\nIllustrating the art of interpretation (""the singer not the song,"" as Penn Jillette describes it in the film), the movie shows the impact of the joke in many forms. Like Monk working ""Epistrophy"" in so many ways, discovering something new in every playing, comedians retell a behind-the-scenes comedy staple until you think you've heard it all... until the next time it's told.\n\nDirector Paul Provenza destructs and reconstructs the joke until this documentary evolves into something akin to a body of work that is presented in a single sitting. This film is a comedy mash up. It's about creating something new that is bigger than the sum of its parts. It's about risk taking, and it's about the love of the subject. It's essential viewing for any student--casual or dedicated--of comedy, film, or storytelling.\n\nAnd besides all that, it's funny. Very funny. Few movies better illustrate the important idea that entertainment is subjective. Reviews can help guide you part of the way toward deciding if something is a good match for your tastes but, at the end of the day, only by watching it can you know if this movie has something to say. For me, The Aristocrats speaks volumes. Snap a 'crat and see.";Swings like Monk

Any laughter on my part was spurred by the laughter of the participants, like a cough prompted by someone else's cough, rather than by the content of the joke.  My reaction was more like awe.  I was absolutely astounded by the verbal riffs that were going down.\n\nThe premise of both movie and joke are simple.  The movie:  Tracks the on-going life of a particular and particularly dirty joke that is more often performed for other comedians than the public, and is an exercise in inventive one-upmanship.  The movie uses an A, B, and C list of comedians to tell the joke.  The joke:  A manager for a ""family act,"" meets with an agent to sell the act, explains what the act is, the agent asks the name of the act, and the name is the punch line.\n\nWhat makes the joke is the explanation, which is open to the teller's stream-of-consciousness, and which includes any and every sexual taboo the teller can pull out of his or her personal universe.\n\nThe thrill of the movie is in watching the comedians create astounding, totally uncensored, somehow logical Rube Golberg constructs of verbal obscenity.  It's like watching a leap into the subconscious, or the dredging of a cesspool in which all the bodies have been dumped.\n\nThis is a movie for comedians, poets, Shakespeare scholars, and anyone interested in jokes, story-telling, or verbal play.

89;85.0;1.0;6.0;"I eagerly awaited this movie to be released on DVD. I appreciate crude humor in the right context, and this movie was going to present alot of it, as well as an insight into the origins of a notorious in-joke among comedians. Five minutes into this film, I knew I was in trouble...that I was caught up in the hype of The Aristocrats. I trust rottentomatoes as a good source for choosing movies, and the film had received very favorable reviews on that site. At six minutes  I decided to continue watching with the hope it would get better; it didn't. I don't care how much one may intellectualize about, and heap praise on, this film...it is just one long, boring, repetitive exercise about a subject that gets less funny the more you talk about it. Okay, am I the only one that has scratched his head saying, ""Who the heck is Sarah Silverman, and why do reviewers always lavish huge praise upon her and write as if she is a household name?"" I suppose that is a way to get us into a group mindset saying, ""Oh, yeah...Sarah Silverman...she's funny,"" while whispering to each other, ""Who is she?"" She is not very funny and anywhere near the talent level of another Jewish, female comic: Sandra Bernhard. Amusing parts of this film: Kevin Pollack doing a Christopher Walken impersonation and Wendy Liebman's alternative name of ""the act"". It's always nice to see Rip Taylor, Don Rickles, Pat Cooper and Phyllis Diller (all legends), but they do not come off very funny here. I appreciated Emo Phillips new look, for I had not seen him since his bobbed haircut days. Taylor Negron-always funny and Sandra Bernhard's male counterpart...but too many close-ups of him. The director did not compliment Mr. Negron by shooting the camera in his face for so long. I did like his take on the joke, though. So, this is my ""intellectualizing"" on this film. See it if you will, but no hip, young, upcoming, with-it, retro-cool comic will be able to make The Aristocrats funny or shocking. Oh, finally, the much praised Gilbert Gottfried bit at the Friar's Club- amusing, but much less funny than it is described even taking into account the context of that particular evening's events.";Big Disappointment and Not Funny
7;86.0;5.0;5.0;I saw this film when it was in theatres, and up until that time, it was the only movie that's ever made me feel guilty for laughing. I mean, some of the jokes are so horrific, I felt so utterly disgusting for even allowing myself to laugh. There just isn't enough forgiveness in heaven for what I've heard. Literally, people were squirming in their seats at the hundreds of awkward moments. If there's any topic or sexual act considered taboo, prepare to have it raunchily discussed in agonizing details because well, that's the objective of the joke. I've heard some pretty nasty things in my time, and don't get shocked too often, but this is comedic naughtiness taken to serious extremes. If you can find it in you to watch this, there are, believe it or not, really good reasons to watch this film.\n  First, seeing movies nowadays, at least for me, is kind of a bore. The same ole' stock characters-love triangles-talking dogs-Jerry Bruckheimer go boom-saving the world-USA rules-type films are getting so hatefully boring. This movie is a welcome relief. After seeing it, I think you'll agree, it's exciting because it's premise is incredibly original.\n  Secondly, there's over 100 of todays' BEST comedians participating in this dirty improv marathon. What's great is that you get to see each comic take a spin on this underground joke, but still keep their comedic essence. Some of the best to watch out for are Sarah Silverman, Bob Saget, Gilbert Gottfried, and one of my favorites, Kevin Pollak.\n  Lastly, not only will certain visuals have you rolling, but it's very interesting to see comics use some of our most terrible recent tragedies and dare to include them in their jokes. I mean, have you ever thought 9/11 could be funny? Superficially, it's mostly for pure shock value, it's supposed to be, but there are certain points in the film where it's also therapeutic.\n  This film is amazing to not only track down over 100 comics and expertly pick the choiciest parts of their rendition of this heinous joke, but just the editing alone must've been a monumental feat. It could've been a comic itself, it had impeccable timing.\n  My mind is beyond repair, but it was worth it.;Humanity is truly disgusting! (but in a good way)

No. But hear this, friends-THE MOVIE WAS NOT ABOUT THE JOKE.

18;90.0;5.0;5.0;"The Aristocrats is a hilarious, wildly irreverent documentary centering on a host of mostly famous and infamous comedians telling their own versions of the oldest, most repugnant vaudeville joke in the world. This joke always has the same opening (a guy with a new act goes to a talent agent's office...) and the punchline is always ""the Aristocrats!"" - with that punchline being conveyed almost every time with a ""ta-daa!"" flair. The punchline itself isn't important - it's the journey leading up to it. Now, what happens in between the set-up and the punchline is entirely at the discretion of the  narrator. The middle portion is what makes the joke so mind-bogglingly risque, as the comics riff and vie to drop in the most outrageous of details, ranging from graphically sexual in nature, to scatological, to gruesomely (even disturbingly) violent, to adding elements of bestiality, to just plain outre. There's a free-wheeling, jazzy feel inherent in the film as the joke tellers seem to yank stuff from the stream of consciousness in their various impromptu depictions of the joke. So when is a film too offensive? I'm not sure sometimes. I'm not sure that the omnipresent bad taste in this film isn't actually superceded by a form of overriding artistry.\n\nWhen I was in the movie theatre watching the Aristocrats, I noticed two things. One, there were people who gasped and then  stormed out in disgust. Two, there were people who gasped and then stayed, but not necessarily in their seats (some were standing or rolling around in laughter). I stayed. My outraged older co-worker stalked out (and probably took a cab home; I was his ride). I gotta admit I thought I knew what I was in for, but I was unprepared for the rancid verbal assault that spewed on me from the screen. To say this film is irreverent is to probably understate things. This has got to be, bar none, the filthiest film I have ever heard. I was in shock, yet I couldn't stop laughing.\n\nLike someone already mentioned, as the film progresses, the constant onslaught and repetition of the joke begin to prey on one's mind, leaving one numb and inured. Fortunately, there are enough funnymen who ""cover"" the joke in hilarious and inimitably personal fashion to ease the sensory overload and to break the monotony threatening to wash over the audience.\n\nThe ones who made me laugh most were: Otto & George (the guy with the profane puppet); Wendy Liebman and her ""wholesome"" rendition; Martin Mull, with his non sequitur version; Kevin Pollak, telling it as Christopher Walken; Jon Ross, he of the flexed rubber grin; Eric Mead, the card-dealing comic; Billy the Mime; Bob Saget, with his gut-busting delivery just prior to going on stage (I knew Saget was depraved, but Holy Crap! And yes, HIS was my favorite); the animated kids from South Park; and the sexy and irreverent Sarah Silverman. Noteworthy is Gilbert Gottfried's version, which he busted out during the Friar's Roast of Hugh Hefner when his 9-11 joke tanked. Thus far, Gottfried's version is lauded as the best retelling of the Joke.\n\nI'm giving the Aristocrats 4 and a half stars because of its daring, its unapologetic political incorrectness. and its vulgar but undeniably frequent laugh-out-loud hilarity. It's worth the price of admission just to witness old-school and currently ""it"" comics getting shockingly dirty and earthy. I can't give it five stars because not all the comics were amusing.  Some - like Stephen Wright, David Brenner, Hank Azaria, Howie Mandel and Carrie Fisher - even went as far as to leave me cold, blank-faced and even bored. Other plodding moments have to do with several talking heads waxing philosophical about the nature of - or being long-winded with their analysis of - the Joke.\n\nBut I heartily recommend the Aristocrats, which ultimately is about the pure catharsis and saving grace of humor. But buyer beware: only those with strong intestinal fortitude should take a peek at this documentary.";Lenny Bruce would be oh so proud
19;91.0;5.0;5.0;"Nothing is further from the truth than the subtitle ending the film: ""Keep the joke alive. All you have to remember is one word.""  I've never cared much for heavily front-loaded, epic-length jokes, both because I fear that I won't get the punchline when/if it comes and because I'm envious of talented tellers, aware that at best I'm good for no more than a one-liner.  At one point, the joke that's the object of the film is compared to a John Coltrane solo.  Right on!  Most of the performers in this film are Improvisers Supreme, playing on a riff, going where angels fear to tread.\n\nThe stand-outs are Carlin (he's always good, but I previously never realized how spontaneously good he can be), Saget (he shows his dedication to, and sheer love of, the art by going on in spite of himself), and the show-stopper, Gilbert Gottfried.  By all means, don't give up on the film until Gottfried's climactic performance.  Like the joke itself, the film justifies itself at that moment.  As told by Gottfried, the joke is every bit as filthy, perverse, and obscene--but it's no longer offensive!  At that moment we are not merely a peverse, dysfunctional family but a human community, united by the capacity for thinking the worst (otherwise the possibility of being offended by this movie wouldn't exist) but also for daring to make the best out of the worst.  We're God's fallen angels, still redeemable because we're not too proud to acknowledge the body fluids that make up at least part of the spirit incarnate.  Rising from the muck, we are true Aristrocrats in the Almighty's eyes.  And if there's a more powerful example of Grace, I can't imagine what it could be.\n\nCredit must be given to Fred Willard for observing that words like ""The Sophisticates"" or ""The Royalty"" would ruin the joke.  The family act that calls themselves ""The Aristocrats"" does so in a spirit of unknowing humility and hope: they're not trying to be merely ""funny.""\n\nAlso, take note of the performer who near the end observes that the joke may soon be out of favor because all of these once unmentionable obscenities are now everyday stuff.  Forget the humor: ""real"" Aristocrat acts can be downloaded from all over the internet, which leaves ethnicity, race and gender--i.e. the politically incorrect--as the last off-limits frontier.  It's enough to make you long for the good old days, when people were sufficiently civilized to be able to appreciate humor as subtle as ""The Aristocrats.""";Like Coltrane and a Love Supreme: Redemptive Humor

A staple among comedians since the days of Vaudeville, the Aristocrats was assembled by comedy duo Penn and Teller, and features many stand up comedians and celebrities offering their insight into the legacy of the filthiest joke ever told, as well as giving their own versions.  In this documentary, you will see the likes of George Carlin, Robin Williams, Whoppi Goldberg, Jon Stewart, Sarah Silverman, Bob Saget (yes, Bob Saget), Phylis Diller, Jeffrey Ross, Richard Lewis, Lewis Black, Chris Rock, Judy Gold, Dana Gould, Mario Cantone, and many more giving their two cents and/or giving their own versions.  The kids from South Park (courtesy of Trey Parker and Matt Stone) even make an appearance, which will leave quite an impression on you as well, and Gilbert Gottfried is featured giving what is considered the definitive version of the joke at the Friar's Club Roast of Hugh Hefner; an event that took place after 9/11, and a joke that brings Rob Schneider to his knees in hysterics.

Jillette and Provenza have created a very funny documentary from a simple premise: the world's filthiest joke told and analysed by the Nation's top fun folk.\n\nI liked the way they worked over the joke with no audience so you can see how they improvised on the filth theme.  Each comedian tells it in their own way, short or long (and very long in the case of Gilbert Gottfried and Bob Saget) and although the ninety minutes is basically about the same joke it is edited in such a way that I was not aware of the time.  It has to be said though that the filming is on the amateur level, by Jillette and Provenza and they admit as much on the optional commentary.  My favorites are the South Park crew and a very quick but brilliant sequence by Eric Mead who uses a pack of Bicycle playing cards to tell the joke.  Two comedians even manage to reverse the joke by having a very safe stage act performed by obscenely named artists.\n\nBut wait! There's more.  As well as the documentary you'll get to see another two hours of filth. Of the several extras these are the two I enjoyed most: 'More from the comedians' has twenty-one of them joking and revealing their thoughts on the Aristocrats; 'Behind the Green Door' lets them tell some of their other stuff.

The funniest take on the joke may be the guy who does it with a deck of cards. Drew Carey is funny because he tells a better joke about a pianist. Bill Maher's take on the joke is better because he changes the punchline. Pat Cooper rightly says the joke isn't that funny in the first place. Kevin Pollak is funny because he mostly just gives us his Christopher Walken impression. And Jerry Seinfeld comes out better than any of them by not appearing at all. This film shows that gross does not mean funny. Just watch Airplane! again if you need further proof.

45;100.0;1.0;5.0;There are enough reviews here telling you what the movie is about.  It is vile & disgusting.  I actually think this movie is a joke on the buyer, it seems like something Penn & Teller would do:  Make a pointless bad movie about a disgusting joke, see how filthy we can make it, and see if people still buy it.  Oh yeah, lets get 100 of the funniest people in the world, but make sure they aren't funny...\n\nI was laughing really hard about 10 minutes in, for about 3 minutes.

46;101.0;2.0;5.0;"The Aristocrats is a failed documentary for many reasons, and I'll point out the most valid ones in a second. First, though, let me explain what the film is about. It's about a joke, a very old joke, that has mutated and grown as it's been passed down from its vaudevillian roots. And it started out going something like this: A man walks into a talent agent's office and says, ""I've got a great new act, let me show you."" So the guy brings in his wife and kids and they all poop on the floor, then fling themselves into the excrement, flying across the room, then pop up on the other side with their arms and heads held high and say ""Ta-Da!"" The talent agent then says, ""Gee, I don't know. What's your act called?"" And the guy says, ""The Aristocrats.""\n\nSo that's the initial framework for the joke. But as times changed and comedy grew, so did the joke. It was basically an inside joke that is just now being let out for some air by these insider comedians who've known about it for years, and now the joke has been taken to completely new levels of rude, crude, and socially unacceptable telling. Beastiality, incest, and pornographic tellings abound, but the punch line - ""The Aristocrats"" - remains unchanged.\n\nThe format of the documentary is a smattering and haphazard pasting together of comedians staring into the camera (not on-stage, mind you) and belting out various incarnations of the joke. Most go beyond crude which, so we're told, is supposed to make the punch-line more effective. But I found these long expletive passages boring and I yawned more than I laughed.\n\nAnother problem with the documentary was its target audience. It really isn't for the general population; it's more for comedians themselves. Historically, it's an interesting take on how comedy has altered over the years by focusing on this one joke, but doing a historical recounting of comedy by telling one joke multiple times is overkill and not going to engage many people (at least many people I know).\n\nThe final nail in the coffin was that The Aristocrats was trying to be both a serious documentary about comedic changes, while also attempting to be funny. I will say that, on some level, this works because it IS interesting to see the permutations the joke has gone through, but it's not funny. And that's what I was expecting when I sat down to watch this. My expectations were that I'd laugh my butt off with the line-up of comedic talent listed in the movie (George Carlin, Drew Carey, Stephen Wright, Lewis Black, Andy Dick, Gilbert Gottfried, Chris Rock, and the list goes on and on), but the laughs were short in coming.\n\nSo if you're looking for a raucously funny film to watch, this ain't it.";"Depends On Your Expectations; Mine Weren't Met"

It is just like watching Pink Flamingos.  It's just sick if you sit there and watch it by yourself.\n\nNote that I believe that most people who give this movie 5 stars are the ones that watched it in the movie theaters and not at home by themselves, on DVD.

The DVD has a few nice extras, that are in some ways better than the movie.  There is a section where all the comedian inputs are strung together for a complete joke.  There is a 15 minute section of comedians telling other gross jokes.  There are some pretty good ones in there.  And you can watch the movie with commentary from the producers (one of which is Penn from Penn and Teller).  However, I listened to the first few minutes of the commentary and found it to be boring.;This is better watched in a movie theater.  Does not translate to DVD.
67;106.0;5.0;5.0;I can see how people either love or hate this movie.  I LOVED it!  It's not like any movie I've ever seen before - comedy or documentary - but it is both.  It is raw, primitve comedy deconstructed as it is performed.  Watching the various attempts at making the joke each comedian's own is fascinating.  Who cares about the joke - as the movie says, it's about the journey.  And the journey keeps taking twists and turns and never stops bringing surprises along the way. I found it hilarious, but I was shocked at how much I learned - watching the movie and watching those around me in the theater when I saw it the first time.  It's a serious documentary - the laughs are the byproduct of the subject, and they are plentiful and different for each viewer - but it never gets weighty or takes itself too seriously. (This is proved by the DVD commentary track - Paul Provenzo and Penn Gillette talk about the art and craft of comedy more than they talk about making the movie. It's like the Cliff's Notes to the movie, revealing a lot of the ideas that they didn't state outright in the movie.) We see the ideas the filmmakers want to show us as the performers engage in them.  It's so much fun, and so fascinating to get a sense of hanging out with  all these people.  The language is raw, the ideas are twisted, but it's just words being used as a creative exercise.  How do they make us laugh at such horrible stories?  Because they are artists.  Some people don't want to know how 'the sausage is made.'  But the result is creative people being free, fearless, and playing with no rules.  I wish mainstream movies would take more chances like this - I don't care about being offended if there's a point to it - and this movie has some really important points to make about artists and freedom.  And the whole way, everyone is just having a great time -it's infectious.  Way better than the predictable tripe Hollywood usually tries to pass off as comedy.  I'll take a disgusting joke over safe, manipulative stuff I've seen a million times before ANY day.\n\nThe DVD has loads of great extras - along with the movie, they explore in greater detail some major points inn the movie, and also some great comedy just for the hell of  it.  Billy the Mime abd Doug Stanhope (with his kid) and Pat Cooper and Sarah Silverman all made me laugh like crazy in the extras.  And the Green Room segment is just funny as hell.

79;107.0;5.0;5.0;The Aristocrats takes us on an insider's journey into comedy and turns out this year's hippest, smartest and funniest film. Paul Provenza and Penn Jillette gather over 100 of the world's most celebrated comedians to tell a vintage vaudevillian joke and the results are a testament to their unique, bawdy and completely original stylings as well as the direction of Provenza (a veteran and brilliant comedian himself).  The film is at once intelligent and side splitting hillarious. It will make you laugh out loud till it hurts and also provide insight into the outrageous, improvisational and irreverent minds of the comic and the fascinataing world of comedy.;A brilliant and irreverent comic tour de force
80;108.0;5.0;5.0;This movie provides the most intelligent look into the art of comedy, while successfully combining it with an hilarious look at the originality of some of the world's greatest comedians. Brilliantly edited, the film shows the talent required to become a great comic - you try telling the joke! It isn't easy! This movie, while clearly not for everyone, is both unbelievably funny and very educational at the same time. Not many movies can claim that.  All credit to the director Paul Provenza.;Utterly brilliant
84;109.0;5.0;5.0;Beyond the fact that this movie is endlessly funny, beyond the fact that this movie showcases wildly enthralling demonstrations of extreme obscenity, beyond the fact that this movie boasts the brightest stars in the history of comedic entertainment, THE ARISTOCRATS is also a smartly crafted, well paced, and cleverly edited masterpiece in the documentary genre.  The joke itself takes a backseat to the concept of how the joke is told, why it is told, and by whom.  It is a fascinating probing of the mind of stand-up comedy, an insightful study just as important in the history of showbiz as Citizen Kane or O.K.Computer.\n\nYes, the bits are sidesplitting (Billy The Mime), yes, the comedians are brilliant (Sara Silverman), yes, the movie is crazy funny (Tim Conway).  But even more interestingly, the viewing experience itself is transcendent liberating, worthwhile.  To witness the fences of American censorship being trampled over with such exalted glee, while also observing the fourth wall of pompous documentary style being smacked around as well (an early scene of Richard Lewis talking to two cameras simultaneously is one such anarchy) makes this movie breathtakingly enjoyable, an icon and milestone of charming, maniacal cool.  Not only are the flowers irresistibly smelly, but the vase is unbreakable.;hilarious and well-made
86;110.0;5.0;5.0;Kudos to Penn Jilette and Paul Provenza for making this stellar movie about one of the dirtiest jokes ever.

But the crown jewel absolutely comes from the genius comic Gilbert Gottfried.  I've been a fan of Gilbert's for years now, but I had no idea he could be so dirty!

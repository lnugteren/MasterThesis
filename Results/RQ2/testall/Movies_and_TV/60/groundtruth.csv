0;1.0;5.0;11.0;"This is one of my all time favorite movies, worthy of watching at least annually. I have the prior DVD release, one of the worst DVD transfers in existence - just execrable video (DO NOT buy the old DVD!). I am very grateful that this Blu-Ray release corrects the faults of the DVD, with excellent video and audio. The movie itself benefits from stellar performances by Wayne and the incomparable Maureen O'Hara, as well as from Barry Fitzgerald and Victor McLaglen, and the ever-reliable Ward Bond (Note that Wayne, O'Hara (honorary), Fitzgerald, and McLaglen are all Oscar winners, along with director John Ford who won 4 Best Director Oscars. including one for this movie). And the fight at the end IS the cinematic definition of ""donnybrook."" If you have never seen this (OMG, you have NEVER seen The Quiet Man!!??), do yourself a large favor and buy this Blu-Ray immediately.

22;2.0;5.0;68.0;"This review is for the Blu Ray version of this film. I watched it on a 92"" screen to make sure it could hold up to being projected up to a ridiculously huge level.\n\nNow, 24-hours after watching this stunning Blu Ray, I am still struggling to find words to describe the masterful job Olive did with this transfer. I know this movie very well...probably at the 'geek' level...so I was prepared to scrutinize almost every frame.\n\nOh my.\n\nAll the other 5-star reviews of this version are spot on with examples about the clarity of this movie (the 1-star review entitled, 'Disappointed', I can't explain, so won't bother trying). I saw what the other 5'ers saw, but whether it was watching it at 92"", the clarity of Blu Ray, or both, what I got the biggest thrill from was the very nuanced, almost undetectable smile (almost Mona Lisa-like) Maureen O'Hara gave John Wayne when she first saw him across the meadow. I needed a cold shower right there and then. I'd have paid $100 for this disc just for that. Wow.\n\nHere's another example of it's clarity: in the Blu Ray version of 'It's a Wonderful Life', at 92"" you can clearly read the print on the distant bank deposit slips displayed behind Thomas Mitchell just before he loses the $8,000 to Lionel Barrymore. The Blu Ray of 'The Quiet Man' matches that clarity.";I'm Speechless!

Hands down, it's one of his and Maureen O'Hara's best films. Funny in spots, good ol' fashioned romantic in other spots. They don't make them like his anymore! I corresponded with a gentleman in Ireland who lives near the area where this film was shot and he had a wealth of information. Sadly, the beautiful bungalow that John Wayne ""bought"" in this movie is a shambles today but it's going to be restored to look like it did in this movie.

17;4.0;5.0;29.0;When The Quiet Man Collector's Edition came out on DVD in 2002 I was all excited about upgrading from VHS to the better picture quality of DVD.  After getting my new DVD home and watching I was very disappointed that the quality wasn't much better than my previous VHS copy.  BUT NOW, Olive Films has made available exactly what I was hoping for, a crisp clear perfect edition of The Quiet Man.  The beautiful colors and sound makes this a must have for John Wayne movie buffs. I've waited a long long time for this edition, and glad I took another chance after the 2002 DVD as I wasn't disappointed!!;About time!!
13;5.0;5.0;19.0;I compared the 60th Anniversary Special Edition (Blu ray) to the standard DVD distributed by Artisan (John Wayne Collection).  I did this using a 53 inch Sony edge lit LCD TV and an up-scaling Sony Blu Ray DVD player.  The difference at every level is amazing.  Clarity of image -- the standard DVD looked like a video tape transfer and had very soft details (at times almost blurred). The blu ray detail showed hair, details of brick, etc.  There was no comparison with respect to color quality.  The blu ray colors sparkled with the very bright, vivid reds that one expects with technicolor.  The blu ray version was generally brighter than the standard version.  I did not detect a major difference in sound between the two versions.  If you have a reasonably large TV screen the blu ray will provide a much more satisfying experience.  If you love this movie, as I do, and re watch it with any regularity, the blu ray version is worth buying even if you have purchased earlier DVD versions.;The blu ray version is much clearer than the standard DVD
4;6.0;5.0;14.0;"I crossed my fingers when I ordered this release of the Quiet Man as there are dozens, if not 100's, of reviews of the various releases of this great movie...a great many being bitter criticisms of the 'poor,' 'shameful,' 'disappointing,' 'abysmal' video quality of the digital remastering job.  Unfortunately, many - if not all - of these critiques have found their way onto the page advertising this particular edition, thus creating a great deal of confusion because the edition being critiqued is not adequately described.\nThis review is here to tell you that THIS is the one to buy -- both video and audio are superb.  The tell-tale clue is that the dates on the poor reviews are all from 2004-2006, but this edition was released on January 22, 2013.  Just be sure that you are purchasing the Olive Films release (OF483) and you won't be disappointed.\nIt would behoove Amazon to remove any review from this release of the Quiet Man that pre-dates 2013 and assign it to the release to which it belongs.\nAs an aside, I remember when this 1952 production was released -- except no one knew for months that it was a movie.  All anyone knew was that thousands of posters and flyers began appearing, saying ""The Quiet Man is Coming"" -- nothing else.  Kids were enlisted to tack them onto walls, fences, telephone poles, etc.  It had people talking for weeks on end about who/what is this 'Quiet Man' thing?!  Masterful promotion idea!  :^D";This is the one to buy!
3;7.0;5.0;11.0;This Blu-ray edition from Olive Films is amazing (I hate that Amazon has reviews for the old DVD edition on the Blu-ray page). Just grab it, the price is low, the film is one of the great films, and the Blu-ray is truly worthwhile. Grab the 'Dreaming the Quiet Man' documentary Blu-ray (also from Olive) if you're sore about the lack of features. Both discs are cheap and great. Take a look at other Olive Blu-ray releases, they've quickly become one of my favorite labels (maybe even more reliable transfers than Criterion these days).;Great Film, Great Blu-ray
52;8.0;5.0;30.0;"A true masterpiece, this movie captures the heart and soul of Ireland. That said, not only the Irish will love it. It tells the story of an American, coming home to his mother's beloved Irland. There he meets and  falls in love with a beautiful colleen, only to find that her brother is  against the affair and basically, out to get him.  Shot on location in  Ireland, the view is gorgeous, and the plot has everything from exciting  fights to tender love scenes. ( My favourite scene is their famous first  kiss, when he kisses her in the storm and then she slaps him. Btw, Maureen  O'Hara fractured her wrist doing that!)\n ""The Quiet Man"" was  John Ford's favourite film, and also his most personal one. He cast his  favourite actors in it, and it shows. John wayne is just great -whoever  thinks he only played himself in every role should see his performance  here. For his love interest we have Ford's kind of a woman, the  breathtakingly beautiful Maureen O'Hara. She gives a magnificent performance  as Mary Kate, and in my opinion should have won the Oscar for it. (She  Wasn't even nominated!) Sparks flew when this couple met on screen, and the  result is out there for you to witness.\n Don't wait till the next St.  Patrick's Day -see this film now. I promise you won't regret it.";A Movie You'll Watch Over And Over
7;9.0;5.0;11.0;The OliveFilms BluRay version of The Quiet Man is the only way to watch this movie.\n\nI have owned several versions of the DVD of this movie, hoping each new release would be the definitive cleaned version (but they are all the same: terrible).  The color in these old DVDs is so horribly washed out and blurred that I really felt as if I would never see the true version of the film.  It was like looking at Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling covered in 400 years of candle smoke and prior botched restorations.  These earlier DVDs were scans of bad transfers, probably from the VHS days, replicated over and over, degrading with each new transfer (if it says Artisan on the back cover, you know what I mean). There was no love for the movie until this release.  And what a difference.  Wow.\n\nFrom the opening scene to the final credits, it's as if this is a completely different movie.  And what a new movie.  This is terrific.  I have to give cudos to OliveFilms for taking the time and putting in the effort to get this right.  It looks great.;The 60th Anniversary BluRay version of the Quiet Man is awesome!
46;10.0;4.0;22.0;"In what was easily John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara's single best performances, the spellbinding story set in the midst of Ireland's breath-taking rural culture is a perpetual favorite film for me. Hardly a year goes by that I don't pull it down from the shelf to enjoy on a stormy day such as this to marvel over Miss O'Hara's astonishing beauty and the endless charm of the characters woven so memorably by Director John Ford. What is most surprising is Ford's sensitive and knowing handling of the cross-cultural misunderstandings that provide the grist of the comedy of well-intentioned errors that propel the star-crossed lovers throughout the breadth of the movie.\nWe viewers are quickly caught up in all this sentimental nonsense as well, and seem content to wallow in the obvious silliness and contrived situations these misunderstanding throws into in the characters' way. Yet, for all the stereotypical and all-too romanticized treatments of both bucolic ignorance, on the one hand, and world-weary sophistication, on the other, one finally surrenders to a work of art unfolding on the celluloid screen, however unlikely or improbable. Like Ford's westerns, the characters on the screen represent cultural icons, and often act like such. Yet here we see much more openness, tenderness, and honest human emotion than in any of Ford/Wayne's other joint projects.\nAs it is, when I remember the Duke, it is in the character in this movie that I think of him as having his finest and truest cinematic moments, acting like a twentieth century man forced by personality and circumstances into facing both his inner demons and his hopes for the future as captured in a dazzling and daunting redhead (O'Hara), a cinematic presence who was every inch his match. Nowhere else, not even in ""Stagecoach"" or ""True Grit"", is Wayne quite so good or quite so believable.  Add this to some unforgettable characterization and the breath-taking beauty of a long-ago Irish landscape, and you have a classic film! As such, this is movie magic that I heartily recommend. Enjoy!";Wonderful Classic Fim by John Ford!
5;11.0;5.0;10.0;"This is a great movie to watch if you want to get your Irish on.  Indeed if you are Irish and do not have this movie then all I can say is shame on you.  The blue-ray is a very nice improvement over DVD.  This is a manly movie and as far away from PC as one can get without being completely offensive to females.  The Duke has made better movies but few where he is this likable.  O'hare is absolutely stunning in this movie.  I think for most people who have never seen this movie by the end you will say ""WOW, how have I missed this one?""";If you want to get your Irish on, this is the movie.
9;12.0;5.0;10.0;I am not sure why Amazon saw fit to lump all the DVD reviews in with the Blu-Ray version, but that's neither here nor there for the purposes of this review. What is to the point, at least from my perspective, is this Blu-ray version is the anti-DVD. The claim is this Blu-ray of The Quiet Man comes from a 4K scan of an original print. I can say this is very much the truth, and what it means for you is it will feel like you are there when you watch it.\n\nThe quality is both the best and worst that technology has to offer. When I read the claim of a 4K scan my first thought was but one word : overkill. It wasn't until roughly 1970 that movie film had enough 'grain' that - more or less - it matched what later became the HD standard we all know today. That being said, the 4K scan put absolutely the maximum amount of resolution that will ever be possible to obtain from an original print of The Quiet Man. The only way to get better from this point is to process the 4K scan via software and somehow auto-magically remove the grain.\n\nSadly, this means the images on your HD television will both be the highest resolution of The Quiet Man you have ever seen, and 'grainy' at the same time. In other words, don't expect to sit close to your HD TV expecting to ferret out minute details you never noticed before. You WILL see the grain of the original film coming through at all times.\n\nAssuming you are not sitting within eighteen inches of your HD TV, what you WILL see is the most beautiful, vibrant and beautiful movie that is possible at this point. There are details that were never possible to see with the slipshod 'transfers' that have been made up to now with VHS and DVDs. I have a VHS of a taping from TV and one of the DVDs, so  I know of whence I speak when I say :\n\nIf you are a fan of The Quiet Man and you have yet to purchase the Blu-ray version, you are missing out.\n\nIsn't that the best possible reason to purchase this Blu-ray version? I am so glad I purchased it, because it was like watching a The Quiet Man for the very first time, all over again. I really can't think of a higher complement than that.\n\nThe bottom line is if you don't add The Quiet Man Blu-ray to your collection, more is the pity for you.;Quiet Man Blu-ray is Outstanding !
37;13.0;1.0;17.0;"There is a tendency when you really like a movie to gloss over any problems with its transfer to DVD. After all, this is a very good movie by the best director that ever lived - John Ford.\nSTAY AWAY FROM THIS VERSION. If it were a car it would be recalled.  Do not let your affection for the material convince you it is acceptable.\nOn my TV, using component video imputes, it has the worst color of any DVD I've seen - with the possible exception of $4.99 bargins. The color saturation varies, going up and down at intervals. The detail is lousy. This looks like a third generation video copy. While the problem gets a little better towards the end, it is still very bad. This kind of treatment for a film that won an Oscar for cinematography?

23;14.0;5.0;10.0;"This film by far is one of my all time favorites. Just simply put, a GREAT movie. There's been more than enough praise given to this movie, I just wanted to comment on the newly released blu-ray edition. After watching the blu-ray version and then comparing it to the Artisian dvd release, it makes you realize how bad the Artisian release really was visually. This movie now ""jumps"" off the screen with it's brilliant colors and detail. You can now clearly see such details as telephone wires, the nice tweed material of the Duke's jacket, rain drops on the faces of John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara, print in the newspaper, and the lines on the character's faces. A job well done by Olive. Unfortunately there aren't any new extras and even one seemed to get dropped all together (Maureen O'Hara interview). My only gripe is that I wish they could've come up with some new extra bonus material. A definte worth while upgrade of the movie. Highly recommended!!!!!";New Blu-ray is finally here!!!!!
24;15.0;5.0;10.0;"This review is for Olive's Bluray remastering of The Quiet Man. I am an ageing John Wayne fan, and this film is one of my very favorites, inspite of the fact that the DVD and VHS versions until now have been (visually) painful to watch. I knew this film won an Oscar for its cinematography but, until now, it's been hard to see why. Now I see. Olive has done a great job; all fans of great movies (Duke fans or not) owe them big time.\n  The picture is so vastly improved over its poorly predecessors, it's almost shocking. As sharp as you could hope for in a movie this old. I was able to easily make out details utterly invisible before; telephone wires in the background of exterior shots, and drops of rain on Maureen O Hara's face in a scene that was obviously shot hurriedly in one of the brief sunny moments between the rain showers that plagued the production.  (OK, some detail isn't necessarily picturesque, but it shows that Olive did their job well.) If you pause the movie and read the close-up of the newspaper clipping during the scene in Rev. Playfair's study, you will see an example of how this clarity does not always serve the story well. The colors are wonderful, with only the reds of  flowers and skirts being a little overdone. The sound is clear as a bell, and I'm glad they didn't try to concoct a surround track.\n  I would say that we could throw out our nasty old Artisan versions, but Olive did not integrate Maureen O Hara's commentary on to this Bluray, so for that reason (alone) I would recommend you keep the Artisan if you have one.\n  A wonderful story wonderfully acted, beautifully filmed, and now gorgeously remastered. Thanks, Olive. I'm going to watch it again right now.";Thanks, Olive
27;16.0;5.0;10.0;"I placed my order for this 60th-Anniversary BluRay on Nov. 5, 2012, to be sure to have it delivered on its release date. I'm happy to report that amazon delivered the film on that release date (1/22/13).\n\n""The Quiet Man"" is one of those classic films that can be loved and enjoyed on many levels. The story, the acting, the humor, the cinematography, the musical score - it's all been there through the years.\n\nWhat hasn't been there to enjoy has been a truly exceptional print of the movie. I've seen this movie many times on TV. I've owned it on both VHS and DVD. All of those sources fell short in the visual presentation of the movie. Overly dark, indistinct, lacking in depth and detail. One had to be content with the story and acting to carry the day (though never having seen the film in a theater or in its premiere release condition, I can't be sure what this film looked like when it first played on the big screen).\n\nThat situation has been addressed in spades in this new transfer to BluRay. The picture is steady as a rock. Details are amazingly clear. Colors are natural, with great contrasts and consistency (though some reviewers more knowledgeable than I have remarked on there being registration issues). I am particularly happy that Olive has avoided the opportunity to brighten up this film artificially to make things ""pop"" with a 21st-century sensibility. The film retains the darkish quality it has always had (which I assume is close to Ford's vision, or perhaps reflects the fact that the shoot was plagued by rain much of the time), but the transfer technique employed - one can't really call this a full out ""restoration"" of the film - has done its magic within the confines of the original film's palette. The play of light on faces is exceptionally well done, especially when those faces tended toward being blurred in earlier formats. It's simply a joy to watch scenes one knows intimately come to life with a nuance that hasn't been seen in decades, and that could have been missed in less-capable hands.\n\nHaving said that, I can't help imagining that a full-out restoration of the film would yield an even better final product. I've never seen this movie in a theater, and I have no idea what constitutes the optimum visual presentation of this particular film, but I don't think that the Olive version will be the final stop in this film's journey back to optimum condition (are you listening, Criterion?)\n\nVictor Young's musical score and the dialogue come through nicely. Background noise has been reduced (not eliminated) from previous issues, but not so much as to sound artificial or clipped. I usually pay particular attention to soundtrack restoration on older films, and while that of ""The Quiet Man"" isn't the revelation of, say, the soundtrack for the BD of ""The Maltese Falcon,"" I will say that within a few minutes of watching QM, I had ceased my critical listening, and found myself sitting back and enjoying the film in all its aspects.\n\nOne caveat - there are no subtitles on this disc, a minus when considering that there is an audience of the hard of hearing who should get some consideration when films are released on BD. For that matter, subtitles might also help decipher some of the dialogue that's delivered in those wonderful - and heavy - Gaelic accents!\n\nI can't recommend this BD highly enough. If you know and love this film, you'll be in heaven viewing this transfer.\n\nIf you don't know this film, I can think of no better way to make its acquaintance.\n\n5 stars.";An Exceptional Transfer on BD
2;17.0;4.0;5.0;"BOTTOM LINE: A daring change-of-pace role for The Duke that sees him ranging far outside his normal fields of duty on the battlefield or in the saddle, but which nonetheless remains a uniquely John Wayne film. Certainly a beautiful-looking movie, filmed almost entirely on location in the lush green rolling hills of Ireland. Give it a chance and I think you'll enjoy it. 4 STARS.\n\nTHE STORY: John Wayne portrays a retired prize fighter who turns his back on the sport after unintentionally killing an opponent while in the ring. He abandons his comfortable life in the US, returning to his native birthplace of Ireland, where he hopes to disappear and live out his remaining days in peace and anonymity. Shortly upon arriving however, he makes some enemies among the local well-to-do, and also falls head over heels for a feisty, fiery red-headed gal. It all comes to a head in the final act and the Duke must battle not only a stubborn local bigwig but ultimately his own inner demons if he hopes to find a lasting inner & outer peace.\n\nTHOUGHTS: I'd never seen THE QUIET MAN until I purchased this new Blu-ray. It's a terrific little film. One that many aficionados of the Duke have likely never heard of. His tough guy roles & movies are far more well-known. But like the wonderful and equally atypical film HATARI!, his reflective work here in THE QUIET MAN is surprisingly good, deserving of at least one viewing from everyone who considers themselves a true John Wayne fan. The movie is a personal favorite of both Wayne and his long-time friend and collaborator, director John Ford. The film looks gorgeous, with several sweeping vistas of the rugged verdant beauty of the famed Emerald Isle on full display. Top notch supporting cast acting aids the feel of the film, with especially solid turns by stunningly sexy Maureen O'Hara and frequent Wayne co-star Ward Bond, as the rascally local priest. Those who consider John Wayne as nothing more than a swaggering one-note lunk with little to recommend outside his westerns & WWII flicks need to pipe down and watch this movie. Some call it Wayne's best film, and I cannot argue much against their thinking. It's a damn shame that this didn't get as much airplay over the years as his other, more popular work.\n\nTHE BLU-RAY: You're not likely to see THE QUIET MAN look or sound better since the day it hit cinemas than it does here on this outstanding new hi-def release from Olive Films. All previous versions pale in comparison. The visual clarity is simply stunning. Like the recent hi-def release of Alfred Hitchcock's THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY, the countrysides and location scenery on this Blu-ray edition of THE QUIET MAN are truly breath-taking to behold. Like watching a moving picture postcard. Wow. Sound is also clear, clean and crisp. No hissing, pops or crackles to annoy the ear. Bonus content is minimal but respectable, most notably a 30 minute retrospective ""Making of"" piece, hosted by noted film historian Leonard Maltin. The film's theatrical trailer is also included. I'm sure glad I bought a copy. It's one of Wayne's most daring departures from his usual fare, and I think it's in the top five of his all-time best.";"A very good, very non-traditional John Wayne film; unashamedly feel good in nature.

I'd check that one out first. [By the way at least one reviewer is hoping for a "" widescreen "" dvd version of ""TQM"". This movie wasn't made in widescreen. With a very few rare exceptions widescreen movies didn't come into existence until 1953 after the groundbreaking premier in the fall of 1952 of CINERAMA , a curved- screen super immersive widescreen process that out- imaxed Imax. Without getting too technical movies before 1953 were pretty much what today's tv viewers would refer to as ""full screen""-roughly the shape of a standard tv screen. This includes ""TQM"".  Even then a full changeover to widescreen/scope didn't happen overnight.

47;22.0;5.0;14.0;"For those of us whose image of John Wayne is the man delivering one liners such as ""You see them Indians across the hill, they ain't dressed for Halloween,"" be prepared for a shock.  In this epic movie about an American boxer who kills a man in the ring and goes to Ireland to find himself, Wayne delivers one of the great performances ever seen, displaying an astonishing range of emotion and acting ability as, despite his vow to renounce violence, he is inevitably forced to fight for his bride, the ravishing Maureen O'Hara, whose brother opposes her marriage and refuses to give her her inheritance.  Magnificent acting by all involved.  The fight scene between Wayne and Victor McLaglin and their ensuing reconciliation is sheer genius, and the movie also has wonderful moments of comedy provided by the great Barrie Fitzgerald.  I put this one in my all time top ten, and I am sure you will too.";John Wayne's greatest movie
41;23.0;1.0;13.0;"What on earth?!  I love this movie.  Therefore I cannot understand all the positive reviews for this DVD.  (I can only assume most are simply reviewing the movie itself.)  How many of us looked for a ""Quiet Man"" DVD, hopping to find something that captured John Ford's original vision?  Wouldn't a digitally remastered, wide-screen, surround sound version of this be an incredible addition to any movie buff's library?  (To all the nay-sayers, a high quality DVD version of an old movie can indeed be produced - see Citizen Kane).  This DVD has all the technological quality of a 15 year old video tape.  The sound, full screen picture etc. are all second tier.  The ""making of"" feature is interesting.  However, if you love this movie, nothing will make up for the overall lack of quality.  Shame on you Artisan.";Great Movie - horrible DVD
14;24.0;5.0;7.0;I can't begin to say how wonderful the Blu-Ray version of this wonderful movie is.  I have always loved this movie.  It was a tradition with my mother and I to watch this every year on St. Patrick's day.  My mom has sadly passed away a long time ago, but I still watch it every St. Patrick's day in her honor.  I went to Ireland last summer, and visited a little village called Cong where this movie was filmed.  When I came back I watched The Quiet man again to see all of the wonderful places I visited in that little village, and how so many things still look the same.  What I also realized however is that the quality of the movie was very grainy, and it was hard to get a true feeling of the beauty I saw in Ireland.  When this version came out, I purchased it right away, hoping it would do to this movie what Blu-Ray remastering did to one of my other all time favorites, The Sound Of Music.  Well, lets say I was blown away.  It is so worth the upgrade to be played on an HD TV and a Blu-ray player.  When watching it, it truly made me feel that I was back in that lovely village of Cong again.  The images and scenery were like when I was there last summer.  The green really pops, but it really does when you are there as well.  I know after visiting Ireland that that is why they are know as the Emerald Isle.  Well, I just wanted to say how happy I was with this version, and what a great job they did remastering a wonderful classic.  The only thing I would add is that I wish they would have included the commentary from Maureen O'Hara in the edition I have.  I really enjoyed listening to her comments on the making of the movie, and all of the special things she had to say about her co-stars and director.  That is why I am keeping that version as well.  They should think of adding that back into this one, and it would be complete.  Enjoy.;Outstanding remastering of a wonderful classic
19;25.0;5.0;7.0;"If you love The Quiet Man, the 60th anniversary Blu ray version offers the highest quality viewing experience for home watching yet. This film pops up on TV every St. Patrick's Day, but with worn out versions with dust and scratches, mediocre picture quality, and muffled sound.  Now, Olive Films has done a great job of a 4K scan of the original negative of the film. Pluses: the images are so sharp you can almost reach out and touch the Irish tweed coats and hats, there is no dust and scratches anywhere, and there is a very clear DTS-Master mono audio track that is surprisingly good for a 50's Movie Minuses: This is 1951 Technicolor technology. The color is muted and slightly warm, with lowered contrast. Olive could have touched this up in their scanning, but probably and rightly so, wanted the film to be seen as originally presented. Also, the only extra is ""The Making of The Quiet Man with Leonard Maltin"" has surprisingly bad picture quality compared with the film itself, but this could be the source material. Only interesting to watch for the background on the movie. That's the only extra.\n\nAs for the film itself, if you're reading this review, you know its a John Ford classic! This is not the new Hollywood fodder with CGI and foul language covering up hackneyed plots and cookie cutter characters. This is a Full House: John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, Victor McLaglen, Ward Bond, and Barry Fitzgerald, plus a cast of colorful supporting actors. These are people and characters you care about each time you watch it.\n\nIn summary; If this is your genre of film and you have a Blu ray player - Buy it!  You'll never see it in a better way.";The Quiet Man - Blu ray editon. The best way yet to watch this enduring classic film!
20;26.0;5.0;7.0;"I just viewed this DVD and this beautiful film is truly restored in both picture and sound. I purchased this film directly from Olive Films after initially purchasing a different title from them. If you have the means to do so don't hesitate to purchase this film over the garish Artisan release with the colors bleeding and looking milky. Unfortunately, as others have mentioned Olive Films does not provide closed captioning for the hearing impaired. Aside from a booklet, the only other feature is a reycled ""Making of Quiet Man"" hosted by Maltin which I believe is from the Artisan release. Nevertheless, the booklet that is included gives some interesting information about John Ford and why he made this great film, that is, if you have a curiosity about film history.";Olive Films Truly Delivers!
30;27.0;5.0;7.0;Thank you Olive for finally doing justice to this John Ford classic.  We've owned every incarnation of this film including the Nostalgia Merchants VHS which was infinitely better than any of the DVD transfers.  And as for our bonafides we own 3000 dvd's and 500 blu ray discs.  The Olive transfer is gorgeous and long over due.  Buy it Mikey, you'll like it!;Finally!
34;28.0;1.0;7.0;The lead review of The Quiet Man DVD on Amazon intimates that there is a 'better' transfer available among the various versions out there.\n\nThere is not. All official editions are of low, VHS-or-worse quality.\n\nWithout question, this is the poorest video resolution of any officially released digital film transfer in my collection.\n\nNow, I treasure my laserdisc of The Uninvited (1944) as that's the best transfer available - DVDs that are offered online are unofficial dubs which have received mixed reviews regarding quality. Those who are pleased with the dub just seem happy to have it at all because you can make out fairly well what is going on and it is a beloved movie to many. Sort of like watching the Time Machine on Chicago's WGN program Family Classics during the 1960s. Hacked to pieces, riddled with commercials and the top third of the screen flagging to one side (our TV's fault - not the station!). But family, friends and the pizza were great and we loved that movie.\n\nA very muddy, unofficial DVD burned off a friend's taped TV broadcast of the 50s exploitation film 'The Hypnotic Eye' still holds a place of honor in my collection for the same reason. I'm not aware of anything better being available (UPDATE - A Remastered Warner Archives edition is on its way here! I was jazzed at first, but another reviewer states that the film has been oddly formatted to create a widescreen effect, losing a fair amount of what was in the film in the first place. We will report when this arrives and we compare the two editions.)\n\nThe Quiet Man won two Academy Awards, nominated for seven, including one for Best Cinematography. The storybook, multiphase greens of Ireland juxtaposed against Maureen O'Hara's glorious complexion and red hair are among the most stunning images in twentieth century film - at least to hundreds of thousands of Hibernophiles. In addition to several other wins and nominations it was among the top ten high grossing films of that year. It remains one of the most beloved films in the U.S.\n\nBy comparison, 'Fiend Without a Face' - you know the 1960 movie with the flying brain monsters that suck out your spinal fluid - was rejuvenated when Criterion gave it their wonderful treatment. This low-budget film made money at the box office but nothing like the millions generated by The Quiet Man.\n\nNow, many sources claim a restoration of The Quiet Man has already been done at the film school of UCLA. Whether or not this is true, how, in 2012 can this vastly more popular and successful film be unavailable in high resolution? Not even a word about possible release!\n\nI know there are bigger issues facing the world today. Indeed, from many of them I hoped to escape on this St Patrick's Day by pulling up a barstool with Michaeleen, Sean, Mary Kate, Red Will, Father Lonergan, the Reverend Mister Playfair and the rest of the inhabitants of the mythical Innisfree.\n\nBut going back to the pixelated mess as it is, bleeding colours all over the place...just can't do it. Not even one more time.\n\nI guess it'll just have to be Draft Guinness and flying brain monsters again this year!;This review refers to all existing DVD editions of this classic film
12;29.0;2.0;6.0;Great picture BUT, Olive Films, which  produced this blue-ray version of the QUIET MAN, has NO regard for the hearing impaired or hard of hearing in that they fail to have closed caption capabilities. I have viewed many Olive Film movies and never do they consider the good people having hearing problems. Would not recommend it for that reason alone.;The Quiet Man  not for the Hearing Impaired.

Something about the beautiful scenery and the simple lifestyle of the people of Ireland in this movie always fascinated me.

21;31.0;5.0;6.0;I have always loved this movie.  The DVD was always so dark and a bit fuzzy.  I was so excited to see that this was out on Blu Ray.  The transfer to Blu Ray is amazing!  Everything looks so bright and clear!  Exactly how I would picture the beauty of Ireland!\n\nAs far as the actual movie goes, it is one of the best feel good movies of all time!  Endearing, funny, and thoughtful.  A John Ford classic!  John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara are made for eachother!;Blu Ray is fantastic!
25;32.0;5.0;6.0;"This review refers to the Olive Films Blu-ray of THE QUIET MAN.\n\nI'll make this short and to the point. Toss out all your other VHS tapes and DVDs of this film. Even the best of those were on the soft side, with contrasty color and an all-pervasive purplish tint to all the whites. FINALLY, this Blu-ray brings back the sharpness and detail of the photography, and the splendid color that was so distorted in earlier editions. It is a MAJOR improvement. Also included is the featurette ""The Making of The Quiet Man,"" which originally appeared on the Artisan DVD. (Unfortunately, the second featurette from that DVD, ""The Joy of Ireland,"" with its interviews with Maureen O'Hara, has not been retained on the Olive Blu-ray.)A 35 page booklet on the making of the film is also included.";FINALLY RESTORED!!!
6;33.0;1.0;5.0;I have seen this film on DVD and this new Blu Ray version that has been restored is the only way to see it.  They did a fantastic job of restoring this film.  It is a 5 star rating.  However, I gave this a 1 star rating because the only special feature on it is a documentary hosted by a very young looking Leonard Maltin from a much older DVD (2002?) and it looks awful by comparison.  Miss O'Hara's commentary  is missing as well as two or three other features from a previous DVD version which is a crime by my standards.  This film is a classic by many people in the industry as well as the public and for some reason they did not include these other features.  This is not a rare thing as other DVD's I have are changed when the Blu Ray version comes out so I have to keep the DVD if I ever want to see those again.  Many people don't ever watch the extras on DVD's etc. but I do and its a shame since there is so much to talk about.;Blu Ray Only!
8;34.0;4.0;5.0;I have had three versions of this movie, one of my John Wayne favorites. The first was a VHS version, the second the DVD, John Wayne Collection ISBN 0-7820-1057-1 version and now this Olive Films Blu-ray one. The reason I purchased this last copy is that the DVD copy has a very poor resolution even though the colors are vibrant. The new Olive Films version while having a much improved resolution has issues with colors. I believe there is an over saturation of the reds and blues but an under saturation of the greens resulting in a washout look. Overall, I will continue to use this Blu-ray copy until a better copy which gets the colors right is offered;Good but not great
10;35.0;1.0;5.0;The quality was very bad. This movie had no FBI warnings and all writing on the box were in Korean or Chinese. I bought 3 JW movies and this was the most expensive. I guess we learned the hard way what All Region, Import means. It really appears to be pirated! Amazon should rethink distributing this movie.;Appears to be a pirated copy!
32;36.0;1.0;6.0;Please someone consider digitizing this movie to a clear picture that isn't fuzzy, close captioning it as promised, and perhaps putting this on Blu Ray.  We know that this movie was done prior to any of these wonderful new technologies, but as an important classic that this movie is, is worthwhile cleaning it up, making it worthy of the audience who adore this film.  After all, there is a full tourism  trade in the area that the movie was filmed  based on people's love of this film, and to honor the fantastic actors/actresses who made this film special.\n\nEven more deceptive is that fact the shells claims in two places (on the rear panel) that there is close captioning.  This is very important for many people who are hard of hearing, not to mention to allow accessibility, that has been made available to the public since 1986.  Let's do this right, folks, really.  There is such a love of this film, just honor what you say you'd do.  Thank you.;Wonderful movie, no close captioning and fuzzy. Needs restoration!
11;37.0;5.0;5.0;"All I will add to the other comments, is that if you are considering getting this disc, do yourself a favor and spend the extra couple of bucks to get the Blu-Ray.  The picture quality is phenomenal.  I've seen ""The Quiet Man"" multiple times on TV and 2nd-rate DVD transfers.  I had no idea the movie looked this good until I saw the Blu-Ray version.";Get the Blu-Ray
36;38.0;2.0;8.0;"Of course the 2 star rating is for the DVD transfer, not the movie, which is one of John Ford's and Wayne's best, but it seems all the other bad reviews spend so much time commenting on the poor picture quality that no one seems to have noticed the entire audio track is out of sync!!  It's noticeable throughout, particularly when characters speak quickly.  I gave a 2 rating instead of 1 (but would prefer 1.5) because, although the transfer is not good, many of the shots retain their beauty - particularly the landscapes.  Where the problem arises is in the red and facial tones.  Terrible.  Still, the movie is so good, I laughed out loud many times.  ""Impetuous!  Homeric!""";AUDIO TRACK OUT OF SYNC!
40;39.0;1.0;9.0;"Though ""The Quiet Man"" is one of my favorite movies, the DVD is the worst in my collection. The backgrounds are washed out and it's out of sync in several scenes. I can't watch it. It's so bad, I won't sell it.\nHopefully, a remastered version is on the books. It's a delightful film, to see ""The Quite Man"" treated so badly is a disservice and a shame.";Stay Away
42;40.0;5.0;9.0;That will be the result of seeing easily one of the top 5 movies John Wayne ever made.  The only gun is a starting pistol.  The horses are either drawing wagons or in the big race.\nThe plot is simple John Wayne (Sean Thornton)returns from America where he was raised to settle back in his old home town in Ireland.  He runs afoul of Victor McLaughlin (Red Will Danaher) over a piece of land, but also falls for Danaher's sister Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara).\nThis simple plot is overshadowed by an event in Wayne's past that shapes and scars him.  It isn't introduced at first but soon takes over the picture propelling it to its climax.\nThe supporting cast, many of which we have seen many times before together (McLaughlin, Natwick, Shields, Bond et/all) all give top notch performances as usual.  The subplot involving McLaughlin & Natwick shines bright and Barry Fitsgerald adds the right bit of blarney to the package.\nWhat makes this very pleasant move even more appealing is the 2nd level of supporting players and the community (who doesn't know Wayne's secret) that they play.  That community opinion and its consequences steers the picture, but only by fleshing out that community can it work.  We care about what these people think becasue we like these people.  From the Bartender, to the Engineer to Father Paul we meet the people of this village.\nI think the appeal of this picture is that community.  The idea of everybody knowing everybody else.  It contributed to its success at the time of its release when it was the reality here to some degree.  It contributes to its success now as we miss that same security.\nYou also can't go very wrong when you pair O'Hara the ultimate strong woman with Wayne the ultimate strong man.  Only Hepburn & Tracy can equal them here.\nWhatever the reason this picture is worth your time and your money.;The wearing of the grin.
15;41.0;5.0;5.0;I am writing specifically about the quality of the blu-ray and not the movie itself.  In short, it is wonderful.  The video transfer is very nice, with bright vivid colors.  There are a few places where there are some imperfections obviously in the original source, but overall, this transfer is top notch.  I have seen this movie literally dozens of times over the last four decades, and watching this blu-ray was like watching it for the first time.  The old VHS and DVD versions were so dark in places, it was hard to make out exactly what was going on, and even scenes that were supposed to be bright and sunny looked like they were filmed on an overcast day.  Not so here.  For example, there is a scene near the end of the movie where Sean and Will are coming home for supper.  There is a shot where the camera pans up to the cottage.  In the old versions, it was so dark, that all you could see was the exterior of the cottage.  In this blu-ray, you can actually see Mary Kate standing in the doorway.  The sound quality is good as well, but only available in mono due to the source material.  I highly recommend this version to any fan of The Quiet Man, even if you own previous versions.  You won't be unhappy with the purchase.;Blu-ray review only
26;42.0;5.0;5.0;"I have tried many times to get a good copy of ""The Quiet Man"" my favorite movie of all time. At last it was achieved with the ""60TH Anniversary Special Edition"" in Blu-ray.

28;43.0;1.0;5.0;I love this movie, plain & simple. I have been waiting for the blu-ray forever, but because they were too cheap to add subtitles I will not buy it no matter how good the picture quality is. Companies like Olive Films who discriminate against the hard of hearing & the deaf should be put out of business. This might sound harsh, but more & more it is becoming hard to find good movies & TV series that have caption or subtitles added. It's very frustrating to us.;No Subtitles, no money

54;45.0;2.0;9.0;Rent before you buy.  Apparently Republic allowed their master copy of this great film to deteriorate, and now they've transferred it to DVD without any attempt to restore the original quality.  Those of us who  remember the beauty of the original were shocked to see the lack of  resolution and quality of picture and sound that Republic has been willing  to transfer to DVD.  Certainly I will be more careful in the future if I  pick up anything with the Republic logo!  Their credibility has taken a  beating with this release!;Great movie, but terrible transfer to DVD by Republic
33;46.0;1.0;5.0;I have wanted this blu-ray for a long time, but there is nothing currently available on the shelves. I have the John Wayne dvd Collection from Republic Pictures and Artisan, and I have to say with the other viewers, that it has some of the worst picture quality and transfer I have seen to-date!  Why can't a current studio film restore this film classic and make a worthwhile production?  I'm sure most John Ford fans will latch on to this pretty quick.  Like I said + others,  award-winning movie but a lousy transfer.  Please clean and restore to Blu-ray, thank you, I really appreciate it!;Please transfer this disc to Blu-ray!!!
43;47.0;5.0;8.0;"The lush and beautiful countryside of Ireland provides the setting for this engaging tale of an Irishman, raised in America, going back home to escape a past he'd just as soon forget.  In ""The Quiet Man,"" director John Ford returns to his own roots, going on location to tell the story of Sean Thornton (John Wayne), a man troubled by an incident that changed his life, and now doing what he can to forget about it and just move on.  And toward that end, Sean travels to the place he knows so well from the stories told him by his mother, to Innisfree, intending to buy the cottage in which he was born, White O'Morn, where he can make a fresh start and build a new life for himself.  There's a problem, however; the land and the cottage is owned by the widow Sarah Tillane (Mildred Natwick), and borders the estate of one Red Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen), who not only fancies the widow herself, but wants to buy her land.  Squire Danaher (as he's known) is not the only one Sean must deal with, though, as other matters arise upon his arrival in the small hamlet of his birth.  And her name is Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara)-- who just happens to be Squire Danaher's sister.  But Danaher or no, it makes no difference to Sean, who as soon as he lays eyes on Mary Kate determines to make her his wife.\n Sean soon learns that in Ireland, however, such things are pursued quite differently than in America.  To win the hand of Mary Kate he must employ the services of Michaleen Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald) a kind of matchmaker/chaperone/marriage broker, who will help him secure the consent of Squire Danaher, without which the marriage cannot and will not take place.  So Sean has no choice but to acquiesce to the local traditions and customs, and Michaleen forthwith commences the appropriate overtures.  In the meantime, he awaits the decision of the widow Tillane as to the purchase of White O'Morn, which he is determined to have at any cost.\n John Ford directed more than 140 motion pictures, going back to the days of silent films, and his favorite star, with whom he worked in at least a dozen of his feature films, was John Wayne.  And when you think of the John Ford/John Wayne collaborations, it's the Western that instantly comes to mind:  ""Stagecoach,"" ""She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,"" ""Fort Apache,"" ""Rio Grande"" or ""The Searchers,"" (to name a few).  Yet, ""The Quiet Man"" is perhaps their most memorable effort, and remains a favorite among fans to this day.  Ford (who received an Oscar for Best Director for it) presents the story on a very personal level, and in Sean and Mary Kate gives the audience characters to whom they can relate; and it's that personal connection he affords the viewer that may suggest the main reason behind this particular film's popularity.  That, plus the fact that at the core of this story there is an honesty and genuine sincerity that rings so true-to-life.  Ford also successfully captures the essence of all that is good and positive about Ireland, from the richness of all of his characters to the lavish cinematography that brings the country so vividly to life.  It's quite simply a wonderful, uplifting film, impeccably crafted and delivered by Ford and his superb cast.\n Too often, John Wayne's work gets a bad rap; no matter what role he takes on, you're liable to hear ""John Wayne is always John Wayne, the only difference is the character's name.""  And, as he proves with his portrayal of Sean Thornton, it's not only a false statement, it's so unfair to an actor who brought so much to so many, in his craft as well as in his personal life.  The Oscar he finally received for 1969's ""True Grit"" was way overdue, especially when you consider his performances in such films as ""The Searchers,"" ""Red River"" and, of course, this one.  Is he the best actor of all time?  Of course not; but he is good at what he does, much better than he is usually given credit for.  And he (and his films) can always-- always-- be counted on to provide good, solid entertainment.  Together, he and Ford have provided some of the most memorable moments in the history of the movies, and his pairing with Maureen O'Hara was a stroke of genius.  There's real chemistry between them, which enables them to play so well off of one another.  They made five films together between 1950 (""Rio Grande"") and 1971 (""Big Jake""), and there is always that spark of magic between them, but never better than in this film.\n A gifted actor, Maureen O'Hara is also, without question, one of the most beautiful women ever to grace the silver screen.  It's easy to understand how Sean Thornton can fall instantly in love with her when he first sees her walking through the fields of Innisfree.  It's entirely believable.  And when you get to know the woman behind the beauty-- who Mary Kate is down deep-- it's even more understandable.  Perfectly cast, O'Hara, like Ford, returned to her roots to make this film (she was born in Milltown, Ireland, near Dublin), and apparently it agreed with her, because her performance is nothing less than natural and inspired.  Mary Kate Danaher, in fact, is arguably one of her-- if not ""the""--  most memorable roles of her career.\n The supporting cast, topped by Fitzgerald (who is absolutely unforgettable as Michaleen) also includes Ward Bond (Father Lonergan), Francis Ford (Dan Tobin), Arthur Shields (Reverend Playfair) and Jack MacGowran (Feeney).  A delightful and endearing motion picture, ""The Quiet Man"" is, of all of John Ford's achievements, one of his best.  And Sean, Mary Kate, Michaleen and all the people of Innisfree are ones you'll remember and want to visit again.  It's the magic of the movies.";One of John Ford's Best
45;48.0;5.0;8.0;"This movie really offers a little bit of everything, tied together in style into a magnificent cinematic package by one of the greatest directors who ever lived. It gives you one of the greatest screen couples ever, John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara; it gives you unquestionably the greatest screen slugfest ever, between Wayne and Victor McLaglen; it gives you unforgettable performances by the premier members of the John Ford Stock Company, including Barry Fitzgerald, Ward Bond and Mildred Natwick; it gives you exquisite color photography of the Irish countryside, so that everyone who sees this movie will want to arise and go to Innisfree. Another thing it gives you, which most people don't credit it for, is the subtlety of the interrelationships between the characters. John Ford learned something from his countryman Oscar Wilde in presenting a comedy: the characters never learn a great many important secrets about each other, and never fully understand each other, but manage to reconcile anyway in the end. This gives the film a blessed grounding in reality that carries its moments of fantasy and whimsy. The Quiet Man is far more influential than most people assume; if you don't believe me, just rent a double bill of this movie and Bergman's ""Smiles of a Summer Night,"" which was made a few years after The Quiet Man. And also, there is something I must restate: THIS MOVIE HAS MAUREEN O'HARA. Wonderful, marvelous Maureen O'Hara, she of the flowing auburn tresses and fiery demeanor. What more can I say? Buy this video, and Erin go bragh.";What movie offers more than this one?
35;49.0;5.0;5.0;"An Open Letter to the Executives at Paramount Pictures:\n\nAs this is the month of March and St. Patrick's Day is upon us, it would be a great gift to not only Irish Americans and John Wayne fans, but to film lovers the world over to know that Paramount is dedicated to working to release a proper high-definition Blu-ray transfer of this magnificent and beautiful film. Fans of the movie, such as myself, have been limited to watching sub-standard and hastily-transferred DVD and VHS editions of this movie since its initial home release about 30 years ago. Washed out colors, dirt spots, and a host of other issues plauge just about every release of the film, regardless of medium. Other John Wayne pictures of the period have received beautiful restorations and been released on Blu-ray to be enjoyed in their original glory, yet ""The Quiet Man"" remains just that. Of all the older films that would benefit from a restoration, ""The Quiet Man"" would arguably have the most to gain. The lush, green, rolling hills of the Irish countryside deserve to been seen as Ford saw and captured them. Please give the film the respect and treatment it deserves, and help to release it in HD.

Failing to abide by the customs of Irish courtship as advised by resident matchmaker Michaleen Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald) and Father Peter Lonergan (Ward Bond)...it's not long before the whole county is in a spin about this big Yank in their midst !!\nAmidst the lopsided courtship and Red Will's refusal to pay the dowry, Thornton & Danaher square off in what must be the most entertaining and longest on screen fights in cinema history...much to the amusement of the entire town that turned out to watch !!\n""The Quiet Man"" is such a wonderfully enchanting film, that it is as enjoyable for all ages today, as it was nearly 50 years ago. Truly, a film for those young at heart and those who can appreciate such a warm hearted and lovingly prepared ode to the magic of Ireland.";John Ford's gentle and loving salute to Ireland.......
51;51.0;5.0;6.0;This is one of my favorite films that I have.  It is a movie that has all the right elements in it, comedy, a touch of drama, great acting and beautiful Ireland, what else could you ask for?  John Wayne plays a man  running from his past by travelling to Ireland, his boyhood home.  In the  tiny village he encounters Mary Kate Danaher portrayed excellently by the  beautiful Maureen O'Hara, and talk about a stormy relationship they have in  the movie! Wow! Its like two thunderstorms colliding.  Barry Fitzgerald is  great in the movie playing Wayne's friend, and Victor McLaglen is  outstanding portraying Wayne's arch rival and O'Hara's brother Red Danaher.  From beginning to end it is a captivating and charming movie.  A crowning  achievement to John Ford's impressive directing career.;A gem of a movie
39;52.0;4.0;5.0;"...which has to do with an anti-woman scene at the end of the movie. Otherwise, this John Ford movie is a-one!\nJohn Wayne stars as an American-bred Irish-born man who has decided to return to the land of his birth for a mysterious reason. He certainly has a jammed-pack first day in town: He meets a gnome-like matchmaker who becomes his best friend (Barry Fitzgerald, best professional Irishman in Hollywood); spies a red-headed beauty on the hillside, soon to be his wife (frequent co-star Maureen O'Hara), and makes an enemy (Victor McLaglen), over a parcel of land. The enemy unfortunately happens to be the brother of that red-haired beauty. John and Maureen have a hard time getting married, due to that angry brother of hers, but just when you might think they've solved their problem, said brother refuses to provide Maureen with her dowry. John doesn't realize it at first, but in this sociological group, that means she won't consider herself married, and if she's not married, well, he can just forget about ever sleeping in that big double bed with her. Situation is resolved as you might expect, complete with a donnybrook of a fight between Wayne and McLaglen, just after the mysterious secret is divulged for the audience's benefit.\nThe film stars the usual stable of performers used by Ford: Wayne, O'Hara, McLaglen, Fitzgerald, Ward Bond, Mildred Natwick, and Arthur Shields (the real-life brother of Barry Fitzgerald, here playing the Protestant minister). Actors comfortable with their director can do a wonderful job, and that's what we have here. The other stand-out in ""The Quiet Man"" is the lush cinematography, which won a well-deserved Oscar. That scene when Wayne sees O'Hara for the first time is a knock-out, with her red hair showing off gloriously in technicolor.\nAlthough I did give this movie 4 stars, I do have my reservations about it:\nAt the end of the movie, John Wayne pulls Maureen O'Hara out of a train station, and proceeds to drag her over the field (literally) back home to their town, where he confronts Victor McLaglen, saying that since there's been no dowry, there's no marriage, and he can have his sister back.  After the money issue is resolved, Maureen tells Wayne that she'll be going home to get dinner ready, and strides off with a smile on her face. The message: When a woman displays too much independence, it is her husband's right to brutalize her until she capitulates. In fact, this is what she really wants him to do, anyway. It's also worth noting that the violence takes place after they have consummated their marriage.  Before that, the Wayne character was very tender in his treatment of O'Hara. Now that she's his possession, however, he doesn't have to bother with that.\nThis obviously misogynist development spoils what would have been a perfect film. I remember my dad told me that my grandmother had liked this film in the movie theatre until that dragging scene, which infuriated her, causing her to exclaim that no Irishwoman would ever put up with such treatment. I must confess that I felt anger myself looking at it. But it goes beyond Irishwomen; no woman anywhere should be subjected to abuse and degradation. I wish I had the power to alter the movie's ending, so that scene could have been rewritten.\nMy final comment? Despite providing us with a disturbing look into Ford's attitudes toward women and how to relate to them as equals, ""The Quiet Man"" is a beautifully filmed movie that shows us a verdant Ireland with an unusually strong cast.";Great, but with one serious reservation...
44;53.0;2.0;5.0;The movie is one of the timeless classics. You can watch it a thousand times and it will never bore you. There's a chemistry between John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara that makes you think this romance is real, not played.  But, and now comes the sad part of the story, this DVD is a joke. Rent it, but keep your hands off it when you think about buying it. The quality is bad, real bad!!!!;Excellent, timeless movie - baaaad DVD
48;54.0;5.0;5.0;"Ahhh... this is one of my most favorite movies!  I must admit to being a diehard romantic comedy fan -- and this is one at it's best!  Sure there is a scene that may be startling to see by todays standards (The Duke dragging his woman home by her hair) but don't let that sway you from watching this classic film!  It's a rollicking, frollicking good-ol' time!  And it has something for everyone! From the fiery-tempered Kate (O'Hara) who wants nothing to do with the ex-boxer (Wayne); to the love that develops between them; to the rip roarin' no-holds-barred fistfight between the boxer and Kate's brother!  This is a wonderful film by John Ford and his love of Ireland comes shining through in this masterpiece.  Everytime I watch this show, I get so swept away in the beauty of the country that I put on my KISS ME I'M IRISH pin (even though I'm not even a little bit Irish).  Pop some popcorn and curl up in front of this movie for a good time!";No Blarney Here!
53;55.0;3.0;5.0;"Quiet Man is one of my all time favorites, but the DVD version left alot to be desired. The film quality is closer to VHS, if even that good. The only 'feature' was a ""The Making of..."" special, which is also  available on the VHS version.\nA great film, but a very disappointing DVD  entry.";Classic film, but a poor DVD transfer

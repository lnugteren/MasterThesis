3;1.0;5.0;8.0;I think by now most people have seen Up, but if there is one thing to know about this movie is that it's one of those Pixar classics that you can watch over and over again. Is this review a tad clich? Perhaps. But when you're shoving Friday night pizza into your mouth, trying to silence the sobs threatening to escape, and using the same grease-stained napkin you used a second ago to wipe the BBQ sauce off your fingers for the tears that are quickly dripping onto your sweatpants, then you know this movie is legit. Nothing like the first 10 minutes of this movie to remind you of the #couplegoals you and those instagram people you follow dream about. 5/5, always.;Breaks your heart and mends it back up again
63;2.0;5.0;387.0;"I had no expectations of being disappointed with a Disney/Pixar BD, and being that it took me a whole dedicated day to get through everything, I now feel it was worth every penny. The film was enjoyable, funny, sad, and scary filled with some nice messages about life and loss. I can understand why the majority of my customers loved it.\n\nThe Blu clarity is outstanding, and the amount of reference points are extensive, but one that stands out the most for contrast lines would have to be when the house is entering the lair (balloons against the dark cavern). The sound is selectable between 5.1 DTS, 2.0 DTS and Descriptive English. The 5.1 was beautiful with tons of reference points, sometimes excruciating (that bird screeching) but thorough nonetheless. Now for the supplements (all times in minutes):\n\nDISC 1: (BD)\n* 5:46 Partly Cloudy short film. Was hilarious. A great depth test for your display with the clouds. Nice little message of tolerance no matter how difficult someone might be.\n* 4:40 Dug's Mission. An almost lo-def looking short take on our main dog dealing with the main three baddies on a chase.\n* 22:17 Adventure Out There. A must see documentary about the crew taking the actual trip to the Tepui location in South America. A beautiful travel infomercial in itself. Loved how their guide only wore sandles for the ascent and hikes.\n* 4:56 Alternate Scenes Ending of Muntz. Sketches and interviews regarding different endings for that bad guy that they had come up with.\n* 1:00 How-to on using the Digital Copy.\n* Cine Explore option while watching the film. The two directors give their commentary with multiple pop-up screens showing art, ideas, etc.\n* Screen Saver. Allows you to set a time period for your screen saver to activate.\n* Maximize Your Home Theater. The standard Pixar multi-step process for setting all of your theater capabilities.\n\nDISC 2: (BD)\nDocumentaries\n* 6:24 Geriatric Hero. History behind the creation of our old guy. All of these documentaries are interview oriented with sketches and film clips to supplement.\n* 8:26 Canine Companions. In depth analysis on the breed choices, training and dog behavior studied to get the dogs in the film to be more - dog like.\n* 9:00 Russel Wild Explorer. Covers the reasons for his character to have the loss and why he was ""egg"" shaped as opposed to other sketch ideas.\n* 5:04 Kevin (bird). Nice reference to the Swiss Family Robinson ostrich; covered the hardest part of any of these animation films - the feathers.\n* 4:38 Homemakers Pixar. Enjoyed the work that went into them studying sub-floors and lighting options in making this look so real in the house.\n* 6:25 Balloons and Flight. Tells the now famous number of balloons used; some interesting dirigible history; shows the Pixar group using that local Bay Area air service I keep seeing fly around here (research stuff).\n* 7:37 Composing for Characters. Have to be into the musical/scoring stuff for this one.\n\nExtras\n* Global Guardian Badge Game. After the initial setup of name, difficulty levels and tutorial material, the game has an extensive amount of country/geography material. Customers grouped around and we did fine for the United States section, but we randomly tried Africa and we bombed (some of the countries they were asking for I hadn't heard of in years) - good learning tool though.\n* 9:15 Alternate Scene - Married Life. Another sketch/interview piece about more material being removed/added into that section of the film. The scene itself would have been only a minute longer.\n* 6:00 montage. A mix of characters doing funny things - will make the kids laugh.\n* Screen Saver option.\n\nDISC 3 (DVD)\n* Film, plus special features from disc 1. WITH THE EXCEPTION of no Spanish subtitles/language; English only.\n\nDISC 4 (Digital Copy).\n* Code both unlocks the copy and gets you the usual points at the Disney site.\n\nOverall, an excellent product no matter how you look at it. The case has that new single hinge, multi-page off center chassis that has proven to be less than durable, but it should suffice for low usage storage. Enjoy.";An outstanding Blu...4 discs filled with more than a day's watch

I'm 6'0"" and 205 lbs of pure dude.  And I cried like a little baby during the introduction of this movie.\n\nThis is one of the most enjoyable movies you could ever watch.  It has so much heart and soul, it just reaches out and grabs your inner kid.  This is right up there with the Incredibles, Brave, and Toy Story 3, if not better.\n\nIt really doesn't get much better than this movie.  Also, my little girl who is 2 loves to watch this.  Obviously, she doesn't get the same experience as me, but this movie really is for all ages.  While you're likely to appreciate this for different reasons than me, you should watch it if you haven't.";Digs into your soul.
86;4.0;5.0;301.0;"Here's a movie for dog lovers, the elderly, children of divorce, FOBs (Friends of Birds), former Boy Scouts, people yearning for adventure, and anyone who has ever loved... and lost. Up is for everyone. It made me laugh out loud, and it made me cry.\n\nI thought it would be tough for Up to match the emotional power of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wall-E/dp/B001EOQWEO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wall-E</a>. The two Pixar films are similar in their lack of dialogue in the first act, which helps deepen the emotional impact. Up begins with Carl, a shy young boy star-struck by a famous explorer; and kookie Ellie, who has a similar obsession. The two kids become fast friends, and vow to one day travel to Venezuela. After getting married, they buy their dream home and fix it up, hoping to fill it with children. Carl and Ellie's life together from childhood through old age is depicted, silently, with delicacy and subtlety. These first 15 minutes is like a celebration of a happy marriage, and you truly feel Carl's pain when he is left alone. He sits slumped in his chair, talking to the house as if it is the missing Ellie.\n\nWhen developers close in on Carl's beloved home, he decides to fulfill his promise to Ellie and travel to Paradise Falls. A former balloon vendor, Carl lifts his home with hundreds of colorful balloons. Stowing away on the porch is Russell, a plump, plucky kid trying to earn a scouting badge.\n\nLater, man and boy are joined by a golden retriever who can talk with his collar, and a huge, colorful bird. Dug the dog is priceless: spot-on for every dog that ever lived, including his obsession with squirrels. Through a series of close calls and adventures, the quartet vanquishes a villain and saves the day. And Russell earns his scouting badge.\n\nIn the process, Carl learns to let go of his mourning for Ellie, and live life again. When this happens, a magical thing happens. Before, Carl's craggy face is gray and monochromatic. At the moment of his transformation, Carl's face is awash in color, and he is surrounded by beautiful hues. It reminded me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wizard-of-Oz/dp/B000Q66J1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wizard of Oz</a>, when Dorothy steps out of her gray world and into a candy-colored Munchkinland. Carl, too, enters a whole new world.\n\nUp is an emotional movie, full of truth. It's one of the year's best films. Score another triumph for Pixar.\n\n-- By Julie Neal, author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Walt-Disney-World-2010/dp/0970959672/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Walt Disney World 2010</a>.";An emotional triumph
70;5.0;5.0;288.0;"Someday, Pixar is going to do it -- they're going to create an emotionally uninspiring, lackluster animated movie. But in the meantime, they're still putting out delightful animated movies like ""Up,"" which defies the usual kid-movie conventions by starring a crotchety old man. It's a charming, fun little adventure story with flying dogs and balloon-powered houses, but underlying it is a bittersweet little story about loss and love.\n\nAs a child, the shy Carl Fredricksen bonded with the oddball Ellie over their shared love of adventure, the explorer Charles Muntz, and Paradise Falls. They later married, move into their ""clubhouse"" together, and lived a long, sadly childless life together. When Ellie died, she had never fulfilled her dream of going to Paradise Falls.\n\nNow crotchety, alone and harassed by a real estate developer, Carl (Ed Asner) is finally ordered to a retirement home. But he isn't going quietly -- instead he attaches thousands of balloons to his house and floats it away toward South America. But he accidentally takes an enthusiastic, naive Wilderness Explorer (a thinly-veiled Boy Scout) named Russell (Jordan Nagai) along for the ride. Poor kid was just trying to earn an ""assisting the elderly"" badge.\n\nAnd the jungle trek to Paradise Falls turns out to have some surprising obstacles: a big emulike bird that Russell names Kevin, a talking dog named Dug (""I am jumping on you, bird!""), and a mysterious old man who lives deep in the heart of the jungle. Turns out the old guy is very familiar to Carl -- and to capture Kevin, he's willing to sacrifice Carl and Russell.\n\nIndustry experts were babbling about how ""Up"" wouldn't be as popular as the previous Pixar movies, because the protagonist is basically a crusty old coot. Well, shows what they know. It ended up becoming one of those classic movies that somehow appeals to all ages -- while the humor and action appeal to children, adults can appreciate Carl's love for his lost wife, and his slow realization that he's clinging to the past.\n\nIn fact, the first ten minutes are some of the most heart-tugging, quietly bittersweet scenes I've seen in a long time. Without a word, they show all the ups and downs of a realistic marriage -- joys, sorrows (Ellie's inability to have children), growing old together, and finally loss.\n\nBut it's not a depressing movie by any stretch -- in fact, it's like a childhood fantasy come to life, complete with a floating house suspended on hundreds of balloons, and biplanes piloted by a talking dog army.. Plenty of great dialogue (""Do you want to play a game? It's called See Who Can Go the Longest Without Saying Anything."" ""Cool! My mom loves that game!"") and an action-packed climax in an aged airship.\n\nEd Asner is absolutely perfect as ubergrouch Carl -- crotchety, grumpy, and determined to fulfill his wife's lifelong dream, but gradually realizing he's clinging to the past. Nagai is equally perfect as Carl's polar opposite: a naive, chattery Scout who is determined to reunite Kevin with her baby chicks. And the utterly adorable Dug and the other dogs deserve special notice. These creatures are utterly hilarious -- they talk (""I hid under your porch because I love you"") and act the way dogs would if they talked. Three words: cone of shame.\n\nThe two-disc edition is going to have some very nice extras, but once again people with regular-def DVDs are going to get shafted because the Blu-ray edition will have a bunch of exclusive stuff. Grr. As for this one, there's a digital copy, the director's audio commentary, kinda-alternate-ending ""The Many Endings of Muntz,"" and the documentary ""Adventure Is Out There"" about the research for this movie.\n\nThere are also a pair of adorable animated shorts. ""Partly Cloudy"" has a much-abused stork having to deliver potentially harmful baby creatures from a kind but clueless cloud. And ""Dug's Special Mission"" is a sort of backstory for the adorable Dug, explaining what the heck he was doing before he met up with Carl and Russell.\n\n""Up"" continues Pixar's running tally of gloriously animated, emotionally layered movies that the entire family can enjoy. With that, I have only one more thing to say... SQUIRREL!";Squirrel!
58;6.0;1.0;138.0;"""Up"" is a great movie, I highly recommend it.  Unfortunately they've crippled the DVD with some new form of DRM that prevents it being played on many computers.  I have bought and returned three DVDs so far and every one fails to play because Disney locks the movie up with a DRM.  Think about this for a moment.  I pay for the DVD, I now own the DVD, but because Disney has convinced themselves that I, the customer, can not be trusted they rig up the DVD, which I bought, so I can't watch it.\n\nI am not alone in this.  When I was in the store returning one of the non-playing DVDs there were four other customers doing the same and all with the same complaint: it will not play on a computer.\n\nAgain I recommend ""Up,"" it's a great movie.  Too bad I can't buy a DVD and watch it.";Don't buy this if you watch on a computer!
44;7.0;3.0;89.0;"Another commendable, 4-star outing from Pixar.\nThe DVD packaging is another matter. There have been many complaints about the computer-incompatibility, but my gripe is about the ""pecking order"" for those that want the single-disc DVD vs. the 4-disc Blu-ray and everything in-between.\nTime was when you bought a 2-disc set of a Pixar film, you got hours worth of neat, entertaining and enlightening extras (example: the exhaustive Super Heroes guide with ""The Incredibles""). By the time ""Cars"" came out, you could only get a single-disc version with very few extras. ""Ratatouille"": same story. ""Wall-E"" somewhat rectified the situation with the available 3-disc version, which did have generous bonuses - if you shelled out the bucks, that is. ""Up"" has the most deceptive packaging of all: a bare-bones single-disc version (you just want the movie and a lot of promos? You got it!), the ""deluxe"" DVD version (which Amazon/Disney advertise as a ""Two-Disc Deluxe Edition + Digital Copy"", which can imply there are three discs [there are not], and there are certainly NOT ""hours of new bonus! [sic]"", as the slip-sleeve boasts), and a 4-disc Blu-ray version for those fortunate enough to own that format. Disney is obviously hard-balling the recession-weary public into buying Blu-ray players and their inflated-priced discs and punishing those who are scraping by with an archaic DVD.\nWhat would have been nice is an extras-packed double-DVD w/o the digital copy (I don't know anybody who really uses this), a better-valued single-DVD version and maybe even a single-Blu-ray.\nThe release date for a Pixar movie used to be an event. Now it's a downer, waiting to see how Disney rips its faithful public off again.";disappointing release from Disney
68;8.0;1.0;83.0;"This is a product review. There are many positive reviews of the movie itself, and I agree it's a wonderful movie..up to Pixar's standards.\nBUT:\nDisney seems to think that they can take advantage of the consumers merely because this is a Pixar film.

What's more: the digital copy requires a special code to access it, and the code expires...so it's not really a ""two-disc"" deluxe version for very long.\n\nFor those who complain about the Blu-ray version, I feel your pain as well. Even so, I would appreciate it if Disney put all of those ""Blu-ray exlcusive"" features on regular DVD as well..maybe if those were included as part of the ""Two-disc"" version, then it wouldn't look as bad.\n\nEven the makers of the Luxo Lamp have noticed Disney's ridiculous attempt at corporate greed for this film. They are suing Disney for offering a replica Luxo Jr. Lamp with a limited number of copies of the blu-ray version of UP. Disney didn't have the right to the lamp, and message boards are claiming that the replica is largely plastic (versus the actual metal Luxo lamp). Disney is trying to sell an inferior product, and they deserve the lawsuit.\n\nAs much as I want to buy this film, I am simply disgusted with Disney and Buena Vista Home Entertainment for their ridiculous DVD treatment of this film.\n\nI miss the day when only one superb version of the film was released for one price, i.e., Finding Nemo...";"Two Thumbs way UP for UP; Two Thumbs way DOWN for the DVD Treatment"
40;9.0;1.0;79.0;Some versions of the UP movies which are currently on the shelves of many stores do not have English subtitles or captions for the Deaf even though this is advertised on the case.  This is not typical of Disney to distribute movies of substandard quality and to allow false advertising.\n\nAbout 10% of people in America rely on English captions/subtitles to be able to follow the movies comfortably.  By not including those captions/subtitles, Disney is denying a significant market from being able to equally enjoy the high quality Disney movies.  Since the typical Disney movies are meant to be watched by everyone in the family, certain family members will be left out of the family entertainment experience.\n\nThe right thing for Disney to do now is to offer a recall and DVD replacement with the audio and subtitles which were promised on the case.  Such actions will ensure the loyalty and respect of millions of Americans and continue Disney's commitment to diversity and inclusiveness.;10% of people will have trouble watching this

Why should I have to buy a 2 disc version with a ""free"" digital copy of the film when I don't need one just to get the rest of the extras?\n\nNot sure what my advice to you would be except to say if you want the whole package and don't have BluRay player, I guess you gotta spring for the 2 disc + digital version.

84;13.0;5.0;48.0;No, I'm not talking about the quality of the animation or the effects.  This movie is a huge fantasy that begins at the end of a life that just didn't turn out the way someone wanted it to.  He wanted adventure, he got a home and a job.  He wanted kids, and his wife couldn't have them.  And now, just as he's crossed the line and it about to get hauled off to the rest home to run out the clock, the adventure begins!  And, what adventure!\n\nWithout giving away the detail, I belive this picure will be an enduring classic right up there with Toy Story.  I even like it better than the brilliant Wall-E, because it's more real.  The envirnomental message resonates with some, but I think many more can relate to life just not working out the way it was planned, of hopes and dreams being crushed, at the looming end of everything.  But still, adventure is out there!\n\nAnd, actually getting to meet one's hero can turn out in a way you don't expect, and not necessarily good.\n\nThis is an animated movie with a mind and a soul, when so many seem to have neither.

53;19.0;3.0;25.0;"A wonderful short film stretched into a two hour movie. Bigger ain't always better.\n\nThe first part is moviemaking at its best and a milestone in animation. The two minute depiction of a lifetime marriage is a class act in itself: moving storytelling without a word spoken. Audiences the world over mellow and cry; why shoudn't they? Whereas, the scene when the balloons burst out and the house takes flight constitutes the film's showstopper, meaning not only that it's the most spectacular, but that it marks the emotional conclusion of the story, and should have ended it right there. For beyond that point, the sentimental balloon can only deflate and go down.\n\nTwo minor gripes on the descent:\n\nSupposedly, once you buy the idea of a balloon flying house, anything goes. It does not. Talking dogs that fly planes can extract a laugh or two, but they totally wreck the mood created so far. It's like matching a Magritte with ""Dogs Playing Poker"" (a painting lampooned in the movie, by the way) on the basis that they're both surreal images. Not so. One pertains a subtle magic that's incompatible with the other's bold crassness.\n\nSecond, I don't quite get the villain. Sort of an airborne Captain Nemo; a discredited, embittered mad genius bent on vindication, if not revenge. In an obvious nod to both Verne and Disney, Muntz's art-deco zeppelin resembles Nemo's lavish Nautilus. Yet the man ought to be a centennial old geezer by now, instead of the silverhaired swasbuckling fiend that comes up with talking devices for dogs but can't catch a giant peacock that only requires a bite of chocolate. That's another thing: people who love nature and adventure tend to grow happy and wise as they get older. Would anyone kill an endangered bird, let alone shoot a kid, after a lifetime of experiencing nature's wonders? Sorry, doesn't click.\n\nAt long last, the movie ends as it should: the house arrives at the falls, the boyscout earns his badge, and the old man reacquaints himself to life. Lovely film that should have followed its own moral: in life, as in balloons and movies, one has to drop dead weight in order to soar.";UP ...to a point!
85;20.0;2.0;25.0;"It's gotten to the point that most people assume that whatever Pixar does, it's going to hit a home run. But in the case of their latest 3-D animated story, ""Up"", I'm sad to report that this new Pixar concoction does not live up to the all the hype. For those who are watching a Pixar animated film for the first time, of course 'Up' will seem quite impressive. After all, no other studio comes close to Pixar when it comes to the technical aspects of animation. But ultimately, whether a film is animated or not, it's the story and the characters that make a film great.\n\nIt was a bold move to choose an octogenarian as the film's protagonist--on the surface the crotchety curmudgeon, Carl Fredrickson, the elderly Spencer Tracy look-a-like, is the type of character we haven't seen before especially in an animated film. And 'Up' starts off with two very neat scenes: 1) a take-off on the old Movietone newsreels a la Citizen Kane and 2) a lovely montage sequence which chronicles the graceful aging of Carl and Ellie, the girl he's known since childhood, who becomes his wife.\n\nThe montage sequence is notably silent and doesn't allow for much character development as to what makes Carl tick. It seems he was always introverted but seemingly happy until Ellie's death. It's perhaps suggested that loneliness has turned Carl into a curmudgeon but with all those happy memories of Ellie, I wonder why he turned into such a sour puss. And that essentially is the problem for most of the film: Carl is simply not very likable. He spends most of his time not acting very nice to Russell, the Explorer Scout stowaway, until the film's climax. But it's quite predictable when Carl finally learns the all-important life lesson that it's much better to be empathetic than uncaring.\n\n'Up' is similar to Pixar's prior effort, ""Wall-e', in that it takes too long to introduce the film's antagonist. In Wall-e, we spend a little too much time observing Wall-e as earth's last operable trash compactor. But even those activities prove to be far more interesting than the flying house in 'Up'. After about five minutes, the house with the balloons becomes tiresome; it's not a very clever idea to begin with and all the smashups as it makes it way to South America, prove to be more repetitious than Wall-e's penchant for turning mounds of junk into perfect cubes.\n\nWhen we finally meet up with the long lost ""Man of Adventure', Charles Muntz, and we saw that Muntz was already probably 30 years old in the newsreel at the beginning of the film, then we must conclude Muntz would be at least 110 years old when he meets up with Carl. But he doesn't look a day older than 90! Muntz at least has a little more personality than Carl but he's much too mean a character for such a light-hearted story. For all parents who plan to take their young children to see 'Up', be forewarned: Muntz and his talking dogs are vicious and wholly inappropriate for your young children who will probably leave the movie theater quite scared and some even crying! The giant dodo-like bird, Kevin, is much more appropriate for the kids but when Muntz's pit bulls start attacking him in old-fashioned bi-planes (straight out of King Kong), the charm flies out the door.\n\nThe film's denouement wouldn't have been so bad had the adventure in South America been a little more engaging. There were just too many scenes of Carl and Russell tethered to the house, huffing and puffing as they try to reach the illusory waterfalls along with the talking dogs. The rest of it was perfectly acceptable: Carl becomes the good guy, realizes that the reaching his goal was an illusion and bonds with Russell back home. The best part of the film are the closing credits which give us a sneak peak into Carl and Russell's life after their return to the 'ordinary world'.\n\nIn the end, 'Up' is a tale of political correctness. Two outsiders, the elderly Carl and the obesity challenged Wilderness Explorer Russell, are able to not only defeat pure evil but overcome both the forces of nature and their own limitations. For Carl it's his self-pity and for Russell it's his lack of self-confidence. Ultimately 'Up' falls 'down' since it's all rather predictable stuff. Pixar has become complacent, simply resting on its laurels. There is only one direction Pixar can go from now on...and that is up!";Pixar rests on its laurels

An apartment room is set ablaze with all the various color of the thousands of balloons that pass by the window as the house lifts off the ground.  Wonderful landscape animation of the Paradise Falls location.\n\n- Charming storyline.  Without spoiling it, it is a heart-warming story of a couple sharing a love for adventure, growing old, and never having had a chance to fulfill their dream adventure trip together.  The man decides to go it alone (but has a stowaway attention-craving child who has lost the affections of his father).  Together they discover that all of life is an adventure (not just the far and exotic), and they learn to value the ""boring things"" and each other.\n\nWe watched with our 7 year old, and there are deeper emotional elements that they seem to get.  There are humorous scenes as well.  Family friendly and a memorable movie.";Another Disney-Pixar Triumph
78;22.0;2.0;24.0;"I love Pixar films BUT.... wow. I must be nuts.\n\nThis movie, first of all, is not something I would bring my nieces to see. It was heavy, sad, depressing and there was no... ""moral"" to learn or ""point."" The old man does eventually ""realize to live life"" but seeing as how he had a long, beautiful life to start with... it made no sense at all that he was as grumpy and rotten as he was to begin with. The entire movie centers on this old man yearning for his dead wife and I'm not revealing a thing or spoiling a plot because that's the intro!! And then it goes on. He yearns for the wife. And on. Yearning for her. And on. Yearning! I don't see this as appropriate for anyone under the age of say, 13, and I can't imagine anyone at 13 would want to sit through that.\n\nTHEN. There is no plot.\n\nSLIGHT SPOILER:\n\nSo this old man wants to move his house to the top of this waterfall to achieve the childhood dream his dead wife never got to see fulfilled. He takes this dream quite literally and moves the actual house to the waterfall... amazingly he gets to South America in a blink of an eye and a storm.... only to magically be at the waterfall but not quite close enough... so he wants to drag the house to the other side of the canyon to get to  the exact position... and so he moves the house... and he moves the house... and this is the plot... the house, moving the house, getting the house just right... seriously?\n\nThere are obstacles that come between him and moving the house to the exact position he wants it in.\n\nHe also inexplicably moves in and out of jungle even though the landscape is shown to be a huge, rocky ledge.\n\nOh then there's the villain who is somehow still quite active and alive?... considering he must be over a century old. He also has been sitting in the jungle for oh, 60 years at least, and has had access to lots of fancy gidgets and wizmos and serves gourmet food.\n\nI give it 2 stars for being colorful. Also, I did LOVE the promising, romantic, sweet intro... But after that... there just wasn't anything left to watch. Except for the cute dogs... a much needed comic relief.

75;24.0;1.0;22.0;"This review is not for the movie itself but for the price of this Blu-ray. Over 41 dollars!? Are they insane? No movie should cost more than $20; and with so many DVD's these days being bargain priced at $10, this film is way overpriced. As if the company is ashamed to ask for so much $$$, they've even included a label that reads ""a $74 dollar value""? Really? How is that possible when all I want is the movie? I could care less for the 3D glasses or the extra special features or the on-line bonus material or the digicopy disc. Does anybody really care about all that stuff? Doesn't 90% of the population just want the movie and maybe a decent documentary to go with it? Does Pixar really think so little of its fans that it thinks it can pull the wool over our heads like this?\n\nI had planned on completing my Pixar collection on Blu-Ray since the transfers look fantastic but now I have to reconsider. We are currently in a recession and I don't have the extra money for this. Of course, this begs the question, why? Why does Pixar have to charge so much extra for their movies? Surely, a popular title like Up will be mass produced to sell a bazillion copies, therefore allowing for more economic pricing. Could it be that the greed that sank the Disney Corp. after ""The Lion King"" topped the box office has now affected Pixar? Has Pixar succumb to its own success? I prayed the day wouldn't come. I was a HUGE Disney fan, to the point of near religious devotion, before the company sold their heart and soul (Cinderella 2, anyone?) for a cheap buck. Please, John Lasseter, give us reasonable pricing and try to remember what made your company special in the first place---caring more about the art and less about the money.

Jaded as I am, I get through most dramas without crying and most comedies without laughing out loud - this film made me do both.\n\nThe storyline is quite unorthodox. It starts with the happily ever after! The montage depicting Carl and Ellie's happy married years is absolutely astounding. Ironically, given the film's title, it's very down to earth. It's some of the most masterful and touching motion picture work I've ever witnessed - animated or live action.\n\nThe adventure segment kicks in at the absolute least likely of junctures: the morning a cantankerous old Carl is scheduled to get trucked off to assisted living. The premise - rigging his house with thousands of balloons to turn it into an airship - is comically absurd. Perfect for an animated fantasy.\n\nI'm not much for dogs in real life but here they really cracked me up. (Especially all the ""Dogs Playing Poker"" references...) The golden retriever Dug is easily the most funny and least annoying of all comic relief sidekicks.\n\nOverall, this is one of the most brilliant and original things I've ever seen.";Extremely moving, funny and original.

0;28.0;5.0;19.0;My mom and I went to see this movie.  We both loved it.  I'm 24 and her 43.  I don't think I've ever seen a Pixar movie in theaters.  After this though, I will see them all.  There should not be any spoilers here.  I will try to tell you about the movie without ruining it for anyone.\n\nFirstly, the 3D glasses are great.  I was worried they would be red and blue and ruin the look of the movie.  Well they look like regular sun glasses, and while they are grey you still see the color of the movie.  The 3D was not what I expected.  I thought it would be thing flying out at me and looking like they were coming right at me.  No no, this my friends in a 3D that I have never seen.  The pictures just looks more amazing than any movie I have ever seen.  Imagine if there was something 1000 times better looking than blu ray.  That's is what I got when watching the film.  It only added to the greatness that I felt.\nNow, for the movie.  One part of the movie is about a boy.  The boy turns into a man, and then a senior.  It shows you some important things that happen in the mans life.  Things that happen when he's  very young.  Then when he's older.  I will not say what happens, but this movie did make me get teary.  My mom said you forget that it's a cartoon.  Anyway, I think one part of the movie is about the man learning that there are always new things to do in life, and you can't have one thing happen and decide to give up and stop trying these things.\n\nThe other part of the movie in my opinion is about a young boy.  Not the boy who is the man.  But, another boy who's a scout of some sort.  He always wants to go on adventures.  He learns a lot about what a true adventure is.  While at the same time learning how to stay safe, help others and believe in himself.\n\nThe Older man has to leave his house one day.  Something he does makes this happen.  But, he does not want to leave.  For the reason that he has many memories in his house.  He decides to go to a place that he once told someone close to him he would go.  So he gets a bunch of balloons and goes!  Little does he know that the boy who is a scout is at his door!  The boy knocks and the man lets him in.  Though not a first.  The two travel to this place the man once said he would go and have a lot of adventure on the way.  Some of the things the boy does, reminds the man of the person he once knew.  In fact the person who he had promised the trip.  Maybe the boy will learn to believe in himself and the man will learn to live and to be friendly as he once was.  The two learn the things that are important from each other.  Though, they may not realize it at the time.\n\nOh and there is also a dog who learns to have friends.  I can't forget that!\n\nWhat is comes down to is this.  This is one of the best films I have ever seen.  The 3D work is that which I have never seen.  It is absolutely amazing.  It will make you laugh at times.  While at the same time either making you think about something in your life or in someone you know.  I can't see anyone not enjoying this movie.  So go see it.  Tell your friends and go see it again.  Then, when your friends go see it, go again with them.;What an amazing movie.

For Christmas we saved and scraped to get a Blu-Ray player SPECIFICALLY to watch this film at home. So, imagine the letdown when we can't hear anything because the English audio on the Blu-Ray disc is only in DTS. (DTS? What is this a laserdisc from 1995????) So, if I want to hear this, I now have to pop $$ we can ill-afford on a DTS decoder. Those of you who raved about the DTS sound quality....I don't doubt it, but I can't verify that either, because Disney hasn't allowed me that option for reasons I can't imagine.\n\nIf DTS really is ""all that"" then why aren't the Spanish & French tracks also in DTS?\n\nInstead, we can hear it in French or Spanish because that's on Dolby Digital.\n\nNever mind the fact we had to buy a DVD disc and a ""digital copy"" disc we didn't want in order for us to GET the Blu-Ray disc.\n\nDid I mention there are no subtitles? No 3D version in any of the 4 discs?\n\nIs it ANY wonder Amazon has it at $18, down from a list price of $46? I'm returning this useless copy tomorrow, and getting Harry Potter 6 instead.

16;30.0;5.0;17.0;Like a lot of people, I was skeptical when I first heard about the story for Up. An old guy taking his house to South America, via balloons, because his wife wanted to go there before she died? It didn't sound dumb by any means, just kinda weird. Then I realized how weird the stories for WALL-E, Monsters Inc., Ratatouille and a few others sounded, and I knew I'd be seeing it no matter what. I may not like everything Pixar's done, but they have a good track record, and just like with WALL-E, they knocked another one outta the park with Up. If you ask me, I think this movie has the most heart of all Pixar's films, and that's pretty hard to do given the amount of heart that most of them have.\n\nUp is the story of Carl Fredricksen, a balloon salesman who lives alone in an old fashioned house now in the middle of a construction site. He runs into a little trouble one day when he's encouraged to sell his house, and takes off with thousands of balloons tied to it. He wants to go to Paradise Falls, a beautiful location in South America that he and his now deceased wife were going to go, but things keep preventing them from taking the trip when they were younger. Everything seems to be going to plan at first, but Carl soon discovers that he's not alone. Russell, a boyscout, was on the porch when the house took off, and is now along for the ride. The two make it to South America, and try to make it to Paradise Falls, but discover a rare bird, 'talking' dogs, and someone that Carl used to admire when he was younger. What's in store for these guys is the definition of adventure.\n\nPersonally, eventhough kids obviously loved this film, I think Up is a little more for adults than children, kind of like how The Incredibles was. The theme of an old man trying to fulfill a promise made to his dead wife is pretty emotional, and seeing the couple grow old in a montage is sure to tug at anyone's heart strings. The cast of characters here is great, and since the cast is fairly small, everyone gets their share of time. Russell and Dug steal every scene they're in, and the humor is typical Pixar, with a lot of little jokes that anyone can enjoy. Having a boyscout out in the middle of a South American jungle is pretty hilarious on its own when you think about it. I can honestly say that this is one of the few movies in the last couple of years that I enjoyed every minute of. I was never bored, and didn't want the movie to end. The final scene did bring a tear to my eye, not because I found it sad, but because of how beautiful it was. Up deserved every bit of that Best Picture award nomination it got, and it's a shame that it didn't win it.\n\nSimply put, the picture and audio quality for the blu-ray are perfect. There's NOTHING bad I can say about either, though it might've been even better if there were a 7.1 track in addition to the 5.1 DTS-HD Master. Either way, if you're looking for an animated movie, or any movie at all, to show off your home theater system, Up is sure to impress.\n\nAnd just like the audio/visual quality, the extras are great too. First you get the dvd and digital copy, and both are good to have since you can have one in the car and the other on your computer or portable media player, then keep the blu-ray for home. Disc one, the blu-ray disc, has a good number of extras. Partly Cloudy is the short that played before the movie in theaters, and Dug's Special Mission is a brand new short where we get to see what Dug was doing before Carl and Russell meet him. There are also two featurettes about the animators going to South America for ideas for the scenery, and one involving the movie's antagonist and a kind of alternate ending with them. There's also an extensive commentary track that'll cover everything not given its own feature on either disc. Very informative, and I liked that they'd point out extra jokes that you might've missed. Disc 2 has even more, with featurettes for the four main characters (Carl, Russell, Dug and Kevin), an extended montage scene of Carl and Ellie when they were younger and growing up (get ready to cry during this one), and more extras covering music, promos, trailers and much more. Basically, the only possible thing missing from this set is the 3D version of the movie, which I'm sure will come out on its own when 3D tvs start to sell better.\n\nIf you like Pixar, you'll get Up regardless of the reviews. It's definitely a worthy follow-up to WALL-E, which is to me, Pixar's best movie to date. This is definitely one for the whole family, or anyone who just wants to watch a great movie with an excellent story and memorable characters. For the movie itself, or the blu-ray, there's nothing bad I can say at all. This is one of those rare perfect sets.;I have just met you, and I love you.

A wonderful, touching movie about a widower who takes pleasure in circumventing those who would have him move to Shady Acres nursing home and give up the home he and his wife, Ellie, made. Walter, our protagonist, is known as a crotchety old man. What most people don't know is that Walter is a lonely man since his wife and life-long love died. They never made their dream trip to Paradise Falls. Like most of us of a certain age, we plan and dream, hoping to fulfill that dream one day. One day never came for Ellie and Walter; but now that the powers that be think he should be in a retirement home, Walter has a Plan. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, a young scout (Russell), trying to achieve a badge for Elderly Assistance, is caught up in Walter's plan to foil the well-meaning social worker.\n\nThis is a Disney/Pixar Studios film, so the images are just spectacular. I have seen the behind the scenes video (included on the discs) where the team of artists travels to Tepui in South America, the area Walter (& Russell) have their adventure. It's amazing how realistic the animation depicts the natural beauty of this area! I don't normally watch the ""Extras"" that come with a dvd, but in this case, made an exception and throughly enjoyed them. From the 3 shorts (including alternate endings) to the aforementioned trip by the artistic team to South America.

76;33.0;3.0;16.0;"***1/2\n\nFor a few perilous moments in the middle of ""Up,"" I began to suspect that the folks at Pixar just might be about to register their first major stumble in the studio's hitherto flawless reign as ""king"" of the computer-animated film (a reign which began with ""Toy Story"" all the way back in 1995).  But, like the airborne house that floats at the center of the story, the movie eventually righted itself and sailed off smoothly into the wild blue yonder.\n\nThis generally wistful and enchanting film tells the tale of Carl Fredricksen, a grumpy old man whose beloved wife, Ellie, has recently died, taking their dream - of traveling to South America, to a place called Paradise Falls, and setting up home there - to the grave with her.  When Carl is threatened with eviction, he hatches a fantastical scheme of attaching hundreds of helium-filled balloons to the house and flying to South America on sheer wind power alone.  This he does, accompanied by an adorable little tyke named Russell, who just happens to be caught under the porch at the moment of liftoff.\n\nSo far, so good, as ""Up"" captivates us completely with its imagination, its lyricism and its charm, along with its visual homage to such earlier classics as ""The Red Balloon,"" ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Around the World in 80 Days.""  There's also a stunning montage sequence which chronicles - without narration or dialogue - the complete married life of the Fredricksens, starting with their wedding and ending in Ellie's eventual death.\n\nThe trouble for ""Up"" begins to rear its ugly head only after Carl and Russell have arrived at their intended destination.  Here they are confronted by a number of strange and exotic creatures, including a hitherto unclassified species of bird and a bunch of dogs who've been given the ability to speak by some sort of shadowy mad scientist who's clearly up to no good in this remote corner of the world.  At times, we begin to suspect that once the writers, Bob Petersen and Pete Docter, came up with the idea of launching an old Victorian house into the stratosphere, they never really figured out what to do with it once they got it up there.  But the messy mixture of science fiction and jungle melodrama they've come up with is unworthy of all the quality work that has come before it.\n\nYet, what eventually saves ""Up"" from crashing and burning in its second half is the wonderful voice work by Ed Asner, Christopher Plummer and Jordan Nagai, the soaring and sweetly romantic score by Michael Giacchino, and the theme that sometimes our yearning for adventure can make us so myopic that we fail to perceive the ""adventure"" that's happening right in front of our eyes on a day-by-wonderful-day basis (more shades of ""The Wizard of Oz"").  These alone are enough to compensate for the occasional narrative misfires, a made-to-order villain, and an overabundance of drooling, snarling pooches that feel strangely out-of-place in a tender and lyrical fable such as this one.\n\nThe animation and backgrounds aren't quite as rich and compelling as they were in Pixar`s previous two ventures, ""Ratatouille"" and ""Wall-E,"" but the less spectacular look actually makes ""Up"" a more contemplative, relaxing work to sit through.";an endearing film that sometimes loses its way

Disney*Pixar has once again raised the bar for quality CG animation and awesome storytelling.

There's no doubt about it, this Blu-ray release is highly recommended!\n\nFrom the creators of ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" comes ""UP"" from Disney*Pixar.  With the yearly success of CG animated films by Disney's Pixar Animation Studio, ""Up"" is not just a film that improves upon modern CG animation, it's a clever film that manages to capture youth but also old age.  Through this film we see pain, loss, laughter, compassion through the wisdom of age but also the naivety and spontaneous side of youth.  An adventure, fantasy film that will capture your attention and make you laugh but also have you in awe of what Pixar Animation Studios was able to accomplish.\n\n""Up"" is directed by Pete Docter (writer for ""Wall-E"", ""Monsters, Inc."", ""Toy Story"" films),  a screenplay co-written by Bob Peterson (""Ratatouille"", ""Finding Nemo"") and music by Michael Giacchino (""Lost"", ""Fringe"", ""Star Trek"",""Alias"", ""Ratatouille"", ""The Incredibles"").  The film has received mostly all positive reviews from film critics and the film was a box office success making over $292 million worldwide.  The film was the second highest grossing film domestically by Pixar (after ""Finding Nemo"") and the fifth highest grossing animated feature in the US of all time.\n\nAnd now that film makes its Blu-ray and DVD debut on Nov. 3rd.  ""Up"" on Blu-ray is presented in a four-disc release which includes a Blu-ray Disc, a second Blu-ray Disc with the special features, a DVD copy of the film and a Digital Copy of the film.\n\nThe film first introduces us to a young Carl Fredricksen who is watching his idol, the famous explorer Charles F. Muntz (voiced by Christopher Plummer, ""The Insider"", ""Nicholas Nickelby"", ""A Beautiful Mind"") who brings back the skeleton of a 13 ft. bird that he found in South America. Of course, because this bird is a species not known to man, scientist calls the bones as fake and Muntz then decides to leave back to South America and to prove people wrong, he would return with the living bird and won't return until he finds it.\n\nFor young Carl, Muntz was his hero and he would wear his pilot goggles and carry a balloon that would say ""Spirit of Adventure"" named after the flying vehicle that Muntz rides.  But Muntz is also the hero of a girl named Ellie.  Both kids love adventure and meet each other in a rundown house which they call their club house.\n\nWe then see Carl and Ellie as children and later become young adults who marry and renovate the run down club house to be an actual home.  Ellie's dream and her passion for adventure is to move her clubhouse to Paradise Falls in South America and Carl makes his promise to her that he will make it happen.\n\nAs they grow older, each time they save money for their trip to Paradise Falls, they run into financial situations in which they have to dip into their savings.  Since Carl makes a living as a balloon vendor, they enjoy a simple life and live in the same house, still in love with each other.  But as time has passed for both Carl and Ellie, by the time they are ready to go on their trip, the two have become very old and eventually, Ellie passes away.\n\nNow older Carl (voice by Edward Asner, ""Lou Grant"", ""Mary Tyler Moore"") is alone, an angry recluse and feels that he has nothing to live for with his wife gone.  His home is all he has and it's his constant memory of his love for Ellie.  But his home is now in an area where commercial buildings are being built and the construction company has tried to buy his home but since it's his memory of Ellie, Carl refuses.  Meanwhile, a Wilderness Explorer, a boy named Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) needs his final merit badge and to achieve that, he needs to to ""assist the elderly"".  Russell is a talkative young boy, a bit much for Carl and Carl sends him off to hunt a snipe.\n\nOne day, a vehicle of the construction company smashes into his mailbox that he and Ellie painted together and Carl is so much in rage that he beats the construction worker in the head and leads him to bleed.  He goes into court and is ordered to move into the Shady Oaks Retirement Home.\n\nOn the day he is to leave his home and start his new life at the retirement home, Carl unleashes his plan by using all his balloons which takes his home out of the ground and flies off and literally avoiding from him to separate himself from the home that he and Ellie had lived in for decades.  His goal is to make good with that promise he made to Ellie and that is to move their home to Paradise Falls in South America.\n\nAll seems good for Carl, until he receives a knock on the door and realizes that young Russell was snipe hunting on the porch all this time.  Thus Carl is shocked that his plans may be thwarted because he has a child with him.\n\nCarl and Russell end up in South America where they  meet a very tall bird which Russell names it ""Kevin"" and also meet up with a dog named Dug who is able to talk (due to a neck collar that allows speech) who seems to be hunting for the bird for his master.  The four end up being on an adventure through tough terrain in South America.  Why is Dug after Kevin?  Why is Kevin needing the help of Carl and Russell?  And who is the original master of Dug who built the talking collar?  But most of all, will Carl be able to keep his promise to Ellie by bringing the house to Paradise Falls?\n\nVIDEO & AUDIO:\n\n""Up"" is an audio and visual treat.  Presented in 1080p (1:78:1), Disney*Pixar raised the bar of their own previous works and managed to capture so much detail in this film, literally I was floored by how incredible this film looks.  From the moment I saw the CG skin of Carl, the detail of the clothing, of leather, the detail inside the home of Carl and Ellie, the detail on the plants, the rocks, the sky, you name it...""Up"" is an incredible looking film on High Definition but an animated film in which the famous animation studio has raised the bar yet again.\n\nBy watching how the creative arts group at Pixar actually went up high into the Tepui mountains, saw all the rock formations for themselves, a chance to embrace, draw and see how things are in the area but also see how Paradise Falls looks in reality, definitely gave the crew a major incentive to make sure the atmosphere of ""Up"" was just as detailed as they saw with their own eyes.  From the flowers, the plants, the unusual rock formations, the sky and weather conditions, the animation crew was able to capture it so closely with again, so much detail... I was literally in awe of how beautiful this film looks.\n\nThere are also details in the way Russell wears his clothes and the clothing movement, the hair of the dogs and how the lighting effects reflect from the hair off the dogs, the slobber of the dogs.  Just the way the physics are with the balloons as it carries the house and more!  There is just a lot of well-thought out details that come along with the film and you just can't help but be impressed.\n\nPicture quality is absolutely fantastic!  Walt Disney Studios have pretty much been leaders in quality for their animated releases on Blu-ray and the colors are vibrant, blacks are nice and dark but again, the sheer amount of detail is just incredible.  No compression, no banding.  If there was a film that I can easily classify as ""reference quality"", ""Up"" is definitely a film I would put high up there.\n\nAs for audio quality, the film is presented in English 5.1 and 2.0 DTS-HD (and also French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby).  The film also sounds incredible.  From the dogs barking all around you, the sound of the weather around South America, the balloons popping and the action sequences at the end of the film.  Sound is crystal clear from the front and center channels.  The film also sports solid surrounds capturing the overall ambiance and rear surrounds and also good amount of LFE usage especially during the storm sequences and when the house is bumping around the rocks.\n\nThis is definitely a film that sounds incredible on Blu-ray and the lossless audio is definitely crystal clear and immersive.  Overall, this is a soundtrack that has its immersive moments but what captures your attention and what sets the mood is the beautiful soundtrack by composer Michael Giacchino.  The beautiful music that captures that feel of yesteryear is just amazing.\n\nAs for subtitles, subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.\n\nThe DVD features video in widescreen (1:78:1) and is enhanced for 169 Televisions.  Audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 and 2.0 Surround Sound.  Subtitles are in English SDH.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES\n\n""Up"" comes with the following special features featured in 1080p (1:78:1) for all bonus material on both Blu-ray discs, audio in English 5.1 or 2.0 Dolby Digital (also, in French and Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital) and English SDH, French and Spanish Subtitles:\n\nDISC 1:\n\n  * Audio Commentary by Director Pete Docter and Co-Director Bob Peterson.

The film does a great job of balancing his story, his emotions of trying to keep Ellie's memory alive through his home, while Russell represents that innocent and naive child and seeing these two characters, total opposites together and trying to make things work.\n\nBut what I found touching is that initial first 10-15 minutes of the film and seeing Carl and Ellie grow and the pain they have encountered in their life.  The inability to have a child, to see their dreams dashed by situations that required the money they saved up for their trip but the pain of seeing how these two have grown from children to seniors.  One thing that the Pixar crew wanted to accomplish with this film is to capture that appreciation you have for your grandparents but also, an animated film that young children can enjoy through the character of Russell.\n\nThere are some deep things that happen in the film, circumstances that children probably will not understand but for adults, these emotions that touch you profoundly.  Of course, a lot of these deep emotions are for the first 15 minutes of the film between Carl and Ellie as we see flashbacks through their married years but the film becomes highly entertaining once we see the child, Russell and the old man Carl together and having to work together, despite Carl getting a bit annoyed by Russell's youth and non-stop talking and moving.\n\nBut it's the pacing set by the screenwriters that work.  The film never gets boring as it the film becomes very adventurous and also humorous throughout.  The humor of a house traveling throughout parts of the world on hundreds of balloons is just a fun concept.  And again, the film never gets boring.  It's just an exciting and fun ride when both Carl and Russell are together and manages to end with an uplifting ending.\n\nAnd the fun doesn't stop there.  This Blu-ray release is packed.  Four discs with special features that really go into how this film was created and learning about the things that inspired the filmmakers but also the trip the Pixar crew took to the mountains that inspired them to create that atmosphere.  That was great to see.  But also there are fun shorts for the children as well and also a game.  And of course, a DVD for those long commutes and a digital copy as well.\n\nAs for the PG rating, this is the second Pixar animated film to get the rating since ""The Incredibles"" and mainly its because of the action sequences.  Those sequences are not scary at all and I watched the film with my six-year-old.  If anything, he was asking questions which related to Carl and Ellie's marriage (parts which relate to a scene in which Carl and Ellie are unable to have children and the scene where Carl is mourning after Ellie's passing).\n\n""Up"" is a film that was geared not just for children but for adults.  The film is mature enough for adults to appreciate, enjoy and to be ultimately touched but also lively, fun and exciting for children to enjoy.  Definitely one of the top films of 2009 and one of the top Blu-ray releases of the year thus far.  Overall, ""Up"" is absolutely magnificent and this Blu-ray release is highly recommended!";Blu-ray: Another magnificent Disney/Pixar release.  Awesome PQ, AQ and special features!

Thus, I went to this movie expected to enjoy it, like all of the previous Pixar movies.  However, I came away from the theater completely blown away by the ""awesomeness"" of it.  Up is a paradigm shift for Pixar and animation films--> it has a nice / funny story for kids but also has a very poignant story for adults, which in many ways couldn't be told as well via normal film making.\n\n3.  Bottomline:  go see Up and be blessed--> and as a result, be thankful for the life you've had and have.";A paradigm shift, a complete triumph
9;39.0;1.0;10.0;"Well, everybody has to jump the shark sometime, right? The A-Team had Stockwell, MASH had Alan Alda as a director, Firefly had the entire fourth disc (The last four episodes have their moments, but let's be honest: They're not anywhere near as well written as the episodes on the previous discs. The Bounty Hunter and the Brothel villains were so 2 dimensional you could use them to split atoms and not initiate a nuclear event.).\n\nAnd Pixar has Up. WARNING: THE FOLLOWING WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS.\n\nSavvy credit-watchers will note that Up does not boast the involvement of John Lasseter at all, and Andrew Stanton or Brad Bird except in the role of ""Executive Producers."" ""Executive Producer"" is a Hollywood term that means ""I'll give you some money and take the credit for your success, but I'm not doing any work.""\n\nThis is understandable. Lasseter, Stanton and Bird have been practically living in the studio since Toy Story. They have families, and they've made a pile of money. I don't blame them one bit for wanting to spend more time with their kids. Unfortunately, like Jim Henson's death, they took all the magic with them and what remained was only someone trying desperately to imitate what was uniquely inimitable.\n\nLike all Pixar movies, Up is technically impressive. The visuals are stunning in some places, and the animation is exquisite (whoever researched the dogs earned his money.) Unlike Pixar movies, however, the writing leans too heavily on sight gags and shies away from character exploration almost entirely. It's like a Dreamworks movie got lost and Pixar kidnapped it. (Hey-yoh!)\n\nThere are a lot of things wrong with the movie, but I think the fundamental problem is the lack of empathy. Every other Pixar movie has been the manifestation of some passion or affection that men like John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton or Brad Bird had for something. Toys and Finding Nemo were about their kids. Cars was about their parents. Ratatouille was about their own passion for creation. No matter what the movie, either Bird or Stanton (or both) were speaking through the main characters. It's why the movies were so good, why the characters rang so true. They were honest.\n\nThe creative heads behind Up not only fail to empathize with the main character, they don't even seem to like him at all. Let's have a look at what happens to the main character through the course of the movie.\n\n1) He meets the love of his life in a decrepit, run-down old house, and falls through the ceiling and breaks his arm. (They later buy the house and fix it up as a married couple)\n2) He marries the love of his life, and they attempt to have children but an apparent miscarriage leaves her barren. (I say ""apparent"" because that scene is part of a musical montage of their relationship that takes up about 10 minutes of the first reel.)\n3) During the musical montage, they decide to follow their childhood dreams by setting up a savings jar to go exploring, but on three occasions, they have to use the money in the savings jar to pay for emergencies.\n4) During the musical montage, the main character buys plane tickets to the Amazon so they can fulfill their dreams of being explorers in their retirement.\n5) But before he can present the tickets to her, she has a heart attack and dies. During the musical montage.\n6) The neighborhood around the house he and his wife rebuilt from the ground has gone commercial. Surrounded by glass and steel monoliths, he is the last holdout and won't sell to the developer.\n7) A construction worker backs over his mailbox, which he and his wife hand painted during the musical montage, and though well meaning won't let the old man repair it himself.\n8) The old man gets evicted from his house after hitting the construction worker who wouldn't let him have his mailbox over the head with his cane.\n9) The old man flies his house to the Amazon, following the footsteps of the childhood hero he and his wife shared, and the reason why they wanted to explore the amazon in the first place.\n10) Only it turns out that his childhood hero is a homicidal lunatic who sets his house on fire and subsequently tries to kill him.\nSo in the course of the movie, he loses his wife, his house, and his childhood hero. But it's all okay because he helped a small, annoying kid rescue a large, annoying bird.\n\nFurthermore, nobody in the movie listens to the main character or seems to care about him at all. The land developers won't listen to him. The guys from the old folk's home won't listen to him. The annoying kid that accidentally tagged along on the trip to the Amazon won't listen to him. His childhood hero won't listen to him. The talking dog, who is the lone bright spot in the movie, won't listen to him. The only person in the movie who gave a rat's rear end what the main character thought about anything was killed off in the first ten minutes.\n\nHis character isn't even well written. When we initially meet him, he's shy. Almost timid. Under his wife's influence, he's happy. But after her death, he turns into cranky old coot stereotype number 7, Asner variant. Sure, his house is surrounded by skyscrapers and construction workers, but his transformation from mousey balloon vendor to crusty old fart is so sudden that I can't help but wonder if the only contact the writers had with old people came from watching Abe Vigoda and Wolford Brimley movies. Memo to Pixar: Not every old person living alone is perpetually cranky.\n\nAnd he's not the only character who's taken directly from the Saturday Morning TV School of Character Stereotypes. The other primary character is a chubby boy scout who is seeking his ""helping the elderly"" merit badge. He's your standard annoying, wise-beyond-his-years preadolescent whose innocence will show the old man the error of his ways. At one point, the kid is talking about his estranged father (Aww! He lacks a father figure. And look! The main character lacks a son! I wonder where this is going...) he remarks that what he really remembers is the little, boring, everyday stuff that he did get to do, not the big, important stuff that he didn't. That thud you hear is the message being delivered like a sack of tainted meat into a dumpster. Pardon me while I gag myself with a screwdriver.\n\nThe villains aren't particularly fleshed out either. The land developer has no dialog, and exists primarily as a man with a cell phone who stands in for corporate soullessness (lessness... lessness... lessness.) I won't harp on him, because he's not really supposed to be a fleshed out villain, though I will point out that Pixar has done the Corporate Villain so much better in both Monster's Inc and The Incredibles.\n\nThe other villain, which you could see coming from the start of the movie if you pay close enough attention, is the main character's childhood hero. A celebrated explorer, he is disgraced when scientists dispute his findings of a seven foot tall bird that roams the remotest regions of the Amazon rainforest. He sets out for the rainforest, vowing to return only when he has positive proof that he's not a liar. When we find him next, he is not merely bitter at his mistreatment at the hands of the press, but downright bat-guano insane. It is strongly intimated that he murdered any explorer/archaeologist/botanist who he ever encountered in the rainforest because he suspected them of trying to capture his bird and steal his glory.\n\nThe main problem with the villain is that the writers think that ""bat-guano-insane"" is a substitute for personality. Every other villain in a Pixar movie has had human motivations, and has been sympathetic to some degree. Even the Aussie dentist in Finding Nemo was more clueless than evil. This guy is just completely inhuman, and not in the ""I believe what I was programmed to believe"" way that the Wheel was in Wall-E. He's just... one-dimensional. It's like someone said ""Oh, let's just make him a hunter who kills people. That's good enough, right?"" and everyone just nodded.\n\nThe one character, or group of characters, that are well written and fully realized are the dogs. The villain has an enormous pack of dogs at his command, and he has outfitted them with collars that translate their thoughts into English. This opens up the inevitable ""I would like that ball!"" and ""SQUIRREL!"" jokes that actually work. They're the only thing in the movie that does.\n\nI'd be more willing to forgive the cardboard characters if the rest of the movie wasn't taken whole cloth from the clich factory as well. The whole denouement is so laughably derivative I would accuse it of being brilliant parody if they weren't taking themselves so seriously. The villain sets the main character's house on fire as a distraction, because the main character is defending the large bird. Seeing his whole life go up in flames, the old man rushes to extinguish the flames, leaving the villain open to waltz off with the bird. How the main character was supposed to stop the villain, who at the time was flanked by his army of vicious dogs and carrying a rifle that acts like a shotgun, isn't discussed. But the annoying kid is very disappointed at the main character for just letting the bird go.\n\nAfter the kid yells at the old man for acting like a human being instead of some paragon of selfless giving (+1), the old man reverts to full on grouch mode and takes his house to finish what he set out to do in the first place. And he does it, by jiminy. The house sets down right where he and his wife planned to build their retirement home.\n\nBut it's all hollow. We know this, because as he puts the furniture back where it belongs and rehangs the pictures on the walls the score plays sad music, and the color scheme is just slightly muted, even the photograph of his wife seems to look down on him in disappointment. All that was missing was him looking at a mirror with a melancholy expression, only to turn away in disgust at what he had become. And quite frankly, I'm not altogether certain he didn't. By this point in the movie my eyes were rolling so much I'm sure I missed some things.\n\nWhen the kid shows up and steals some balloons so he can chase after the bird himself, the main character finally ""gets it."" He expunges the house of everything inside, so the withering balloons could lift what remained skyward once more. The last we see of the furniture, as the house flies away, is his chair sitting neatly next to his wife's chair on the ground as the triumphal music swells and eggs the old man onward and upward. (Yeah! You dump that old crappy symbol of the life you had with your wife. Forget her, it's time to go save some kid you don't know and a bird you don't like!) He chases after the villain, who has captured the annoying child and left him tied to a chair and ready to drop from the loading dock of his blimp to the ground so many thousands of feet below. The villain and the main character have a climactic battle that employs a clumsy version of the ""I threw my back out"" joke that was so much better in The Incredibles. See, it's funny because they're both so old. Also old people smell like prunes.\n\nSeriously. That's how the dogs find him as he sneaks aboard the villain's airship. They smell prunes. They couldn't even spare the cash for some additional syllables and use the word ""liniment.""\n\nNeedless to say, the kid is rescued. The villain was dispatched through the use of a high-fall the likes of which I haven't seen since I watched every movie that ever came out between 1985 and 1999.\n\nFinally, we're treated to a scene where the annoying kids finally gets his helping the elderly merit badge, with the main character standing by his side because the kid's father couldn't be there (all together now: Awwww!) and then they go share ice cream and count different color cars, just like the kid used to do with his dad (and again: Awwwwww!) and apparently the court order remanding the old man to a home has been rescinded, or at least it's unenforceable because he now lives in the villain's airship.\n\nOh, and just to throw a bone to those of us who understood why it was important to the main character to keep a promise he made to his wife so many years ago, the last we see of the house, it just happened to land right where he wanted to put it. What a coincidence.\n\nI suppose Up was an accurate enough title for the movie, given the infatuation with flight. But if they wanted to make it more accurate and a whole lot more descriptive they would have called it ""Trite.""\n\nThat's not something I ever thought I'd be able to say about a Pixar movie. Usually they come right up to the edge of being trite without actually falling off the precipice. This one just points the car at the edge of the cliff and lays down rubber.\n\nI have more complaints, like about how this movie is a violent departure from Pixar's classical themes about how nostalgia is a good and fundamentally human emotion, and the fact that it's not only okay, but admirable that people have attachments to physical objects. Heck, if the people who made Up had done Cars, the residents of Radiator Springs would just pack up and move to California, because it's just a road, right? Move on.\n\nBut I'm running long, so I won't. In conclusion, I just want to say that I will no longer buy a Pixar movie on DVD just because Pixar did it. It was my last vestige of fanboy mentality, and Up snuffed it out. I don't know whether I should be angry or grateful.";Pixar jumps the shark
30;40.0;1.0;13.0;I did not like this movie.  The beginning of the movie is very depressing, with hints toward the depressing factors all throughout the movie.  This made it very difficult to enjoy the movie.  Everyone that I've talked too that has seen the movie say the same thing.  The beginning is very sad, and so is the rest of the movie.  People who say it's uplifting obviously weren't really paying attention to what was happening on the screen in front of them.  The parts of the movie that were supposed to be funny really weren't funny enough to dispell the sadness of the movie.  Also the plot wasn't all that good.  Out of all the disney movies I've seen, this has to have possibly the worst overall story out of all of them.\n\nIf you have had mixed reports and feel like at least watching the movie to see if you like it, I would recommend renting the movie to see if you like it or not, although it is a very depressing movie.;Could it be any more depressing?

The movie starts out great and appears that it will be a fun and sensitive look into a life lived, goals planned for but postponed and sharing love through it all.

Put more stupidity in and be sure to have lots of bodily fluids, 8 year old males love bodily fluids, I mean look what it does for Dreamworks!"". So the chance is missed, what could have been a great movie that would be treasured for years ends up just another piece of tripe. THe ironic thing is that no 8 years old will be happy sitting through the first part of the movie and no adult will like the last part of the movie.

The first 20 minutes of ""Up"" so perfectly captured the joy of love and the despair at its loss, that I cried almost continually.\n\nAs for the rest of the film... eh.\n\nPixar is perennially complimented for its focus on story, story, story -- in particular, character-driven stories. Up to the point where Carl ""takes off"", ""Up"" is a character-driven story.\n\nUnfortunately, once Carl lands in Paradise Falls (courtesy of a Wilderness Scout GPS system) he now is obliged to have the adventure he's been waiting 50 years for. What will it be? I know! His childhood hero, Charles Muntz, is still alive, still trying to catch a phororhacos to prove the bird actually exists. And guess what? Muntz (voiced by a wasted Christopher Plummer) is actually a villain, murderous in his attempts to keep anyone from ""stealing"" his discovery.\n\nThe last third of the film is violent in a way that's downright mean-spirited for a PG ""family"" film. Muntz leaves Russell tied to a chair where he can fall out of the dirigible, and comes after Carl with a sword. And though he's been in the jungle for half a century, Muntz somehow has access to microcircuitry that make it possible for his dogs to talk. (Even Bob Pease isn't that clever.) And, of course, Muntz isn't reformed, but falls to his death.\n\nCan you say obvious? Can you preposterous? Can you say stupid?\n\nThis isn't character-based storytelling, it's plot-based melodrama. What happens to Carl occurs because it ""has"" to in order for him (and Russell) to strut his (their) stuff.\n\nThis isn't good storytelling. It stinks, in fact. Bad Pixar. Bad Pixar. Not even all the very funny stuff you expect from a Pixar film, which is present in abundance, can save ""Up"" from being shallow and dismally predictable.\n\nUnlike most Pixar films, it's unlikely I'll want to see this one even a second time.\n\nA Note on 3D\n\nI saw 3D movies when I was a kid, but don't remember the details. (Yes, they used gray Polaroid filters, not red and green, despite what all the ""experts"" tell you.) Pixar's use of 3D is superb. It never draws attention to itself, except when it's visually pertinent. And every object has depth and roundness -- this isn't the ViewMaster sort of image, with multiple planes of flat objects.\n\nAs for the RealD system, there is nothing _fundamentally_ new about it. The digital projector eliminates registration and timing problems, and the use of circular polarization means you don't have to hold your head perfectly level. But it works the same as the first polarized 3D movies did at the GM exhibit at the 1938 World's Fair. (I have a bunch of the viewers.)\n\nHowever... One reviewer commented at the loss of ""vividness"" when you put the glasses on, ascribing it to the unavoidable loss of light in the viewing filters. To my surprise, this reviewer was correct. The colors are not only somewhat desaturated, but look ""odd"" in a way I can't quite explain. This is not simply a drop in light level; something else is going on, but I don't know what it is.\n\nTHOUGHTS ON THE BLU-RAY (AND FURTHER THOUGHTS ON THE FILM)\n\nBecause I could get the BD set for $15.50 (including tax and shipping), I was a hypocrite and bought it. The image quality (on a 60"" Kuro) is far superior to what I saw in the theater. (This was likely the fault of that particular theater's presentation, as the 3D editions of ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2"" at another theater were much better.) The BD also makes you aware of the subtle naturalness of the animation.\n\nA second viewing only confirmed what an utter botch this film is. If you replace the talking dogs with regular dogs, you have a serious adult film lightened only (a bit) by the presence of an irritating child. It's obvious that the talking dogs are there for humor (and there's no denying they /are/ funny -- when they're not threatening to rip out a character's throat), and to appeal to the kids. (The dogs are the focus of the TV spots.) Without them, there's little in this film to appeal to children.\n\nIn one of the supplements, Pete Docter explains the difficulties in figuring out how to kill off Muntz. Muntz is supposed to be Carl's psychological ""Doppelganger"", the person Carl was in the process of becoming, so it's necessary to get rid of him so that Carl can progress. This thought had never crossed my mind (I don't remember any review, anywhere, that raised it), and the story does essentially nothing to develop it. Indeed, the ""reveal"" that Muntz is a psychopathic murderer comes much too soon, cancelling any opportunity for interaction between him and Carl that would have clarified their implied relationship.\n\nOf course, once you get rid of the talking dogs, you're left with a fairly conventional drama of the sort we've seen too many times before -- a grumpy old person who's just lost their spouse is restored to happiness by a child who brings light and happiness into their wretched life.\n\nWhen Walt Disney was making ""Snow White"", he said he never wanted to do anything ""ugly"". ""Up"" has a number of truly ugly moments that are out of place in a movie intended for all ages. Yes, life /can/ be ugly, and there is no reason why children shouldn't be exposed to it. (When Disney's daughter complained about the death of Bambi's mother, his resonse was that that was the way life was.) But you don't do it in a film that's an unpalatable mish-mosh of broad humor and crude terror -- including, but not limited to, a child being tied to a chair and left where he will fall to his death.\n\nIt's interesting how this particular sequence seems to invert a similar sequence in ""Snow White"". Remember where she's hanging from a vine and about to drop who-knows-how-far to her possible death? The animators argued over ""whether the fall would kill her"" -- then realized they were talking about an animated character, albeit one who seemed very real to them (which, of course, is very much the point of the film). In ""Up!"", it doesn't matter that Russell is put in a situation where he's likely to be killed, /because/ he's an animated figure and /can't/ die.";A downer. A major disappointment -- and Pixar's first major miscalculation
20;48.0;2.0;10.0;It's not a good thing when the cast outside of the leads outshine and overtake the main event. The two leads are like listening to chalk on a blackboard for two obnoxious hours. The old codger is the cranky fuddy duddy you would shy from checking the mail if he was in the front yard next to yours. I don't want to hear it. The wilderness explorer kid is a slap in the face contrivance to the boy scouts of America that they are a herd of cutsie wootsie beings trying to be a flame of gosh golly gee goodness. Wrong. Boy scouts are a serious bunch of explorers that surround themselves in fun with what they are doing. Learning to be a better American, and not a bothersome kid. The dogs should have taken over production as the short animation extra, Special Mission, proves they were more adorable, original, and could hold their own turf away from the dreary humans. Even the extra Partly Cloudy was a milestone in comparison to the main feature. I mean what is with these features. The artists conjure up some finally drawn character, give them some rather cliche typecast traits and expect the audience to fall in love. Like when the old man tearfully browsed through an old photo album with emotional piano score, I was thinking, the audience never got to know his sweetheart other than the goofy intro to the movie. I fastforwrded that part on the DVD, thank goodness, it was giving me the creeps.;Up can stay up
21;49.0;1.0;10.0;This is without a doubt the worst ever big-budget animated film. Only ethereal unthinking saps would buy any part of this. Even suspending disbelief to below moron status does not save it. How can an adventurer who is pushing 40 when the old-man protagonist is a 10 year old, look to be only ~60 when the ex-10year old is now 70ish? The plot is nonsensical to the extreme and follows no real line. And don't even think about the physics of strings on balloons being sufficient for any of the outcomes that occur. And the Oscar nomination is so ludicrous as to confirm that the Oscars are now little more than ways for Hollowood insiders to push their agendas.;Worst ever animated movie
24;50.0;2.0;9.0;The marketing portrays UP as a lighthearted comedy adventure. It isn't. While there are certainly funny moments, on the whole it's the most depressing movie I've seen in years, and the contrast between the expectation and the reality is shocking. I love dark movies, but the way UP is presented borders on deceptive. I almost wonder if this film was intended as a psychological experiment.\n\nI saw UP in the theater. Seated in the row in front of me was a family of ogres who'd spent the day stomping an orphanage flat. They'd brought a box of kittens to snack on during the movie. Within 10 minutes of  the start of the film every one of them was bawling uncontrollably. I'm a stone-cold heartless monster myself, and *never* cry in movies... until UP. Hey Pixar, here's a tip: tears ruin the 3D effect.\n\nPresumably the intention was use the death of the old man's wife as a starting point for an ultimately uplifting (no pun intended) story. Unfortunately, it casts such a dark shadow on the rest of the movie that the funny bits don't even begin to make up for it. Dug the dog is the brightest aspect of the movie and a hilarious character, but doesn't balance out the cascade of tragedies great and small that befall the old man. Seeing the old man tied to his house like a pack animal and being forced to drag it through the jungle is one of the *lighter* moments. WTH? The happy ending really rings hollow, and isn't worth the journey it takes to get there.\n\nI considered not mentioning this next point, but I'm going to go ahead and do so anyway. My mother-in-law died a few months before UP came out, and my father-in-law was, as one would expect, devastated. My wife and I both separately came to the conclusion that if he'd seen the movie he absolutely would have gone home and eaten his shotgun afterward. I know that I used hyperbole earlier in this review, but on this point I'm being completely serious and not exaggerating.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, UP is superb. The animation, character design, vocal performances, etc. are all top notch, just as you would expect from Pixar. However, I would only recommend it to emotional cripples, psychopaths, and people who have never experienced the loss of a loved one.;Should come with a bottle of antidepressants
41;51.0;2.0;9.0;I really enjoy the first half of this movie, for this reason I bought it. The old mam the child, the flying house, the big bird, even the dog. It was touching...\n\nThe film fails in the end with its...(or film makers, as every animation movie is made from a lot of talented creative people) use or introduction of a VILLAIN!.  Kids I talked to say the same thing, the villain was not necessary, or the worse aspect of the film.  The movie would have been better paced out if they just found things from the Villain who should have been dead by then anyways(years???).  If they had the dogs acting as a pack, carrying out his wishes then maybe... Better yet they should have had the story focus on the jungle, and the goal of reaching Paradise Falls, using the jungle and the other animals as well hurdles.\n\nFinding Nemo could be used as an example for its no usage of a true villain.  Nemo had obstacles, more than one villain. Or hurdles, where they overcome the best and worse of what the sea had to offer. No I don't think the girl and the dentist where villains. Wall-e was good too, Bolt was ok, Cars... villains are overrated unless they truly engulf the film... most of the fav villains have been from 2d classic movies(most are women?)... Monster House was a good sort of villain(again a woman). Monster Inc is good...\n\nI hope the reason for the delay of Finding Nemo on BLU-RAY is that they plan to release it in 3D like Toy Story1 and 2.... I doubt it....;No NEED for VILLIANS
69;52.0;2.0;9.0;I haven't seen the movie so this rating reflects the packaging. The thing I found real funny was the little sign or sticker (can't tell) that says $74 value. NO MOVIE is worth $74!!! Why are we forced to pay for the Blu-Ray and DVD? Why isn't there a cheaper 3-disc version without the DVD movie? Also if this movie was in 3-D why isn't it in 3-D on the discs? It can be done, I have Journey to the Center of the Earth and My Bloody Valentine which both has good 3-D effects. If I knew for sure I could sell off the dvd movie disc for $10 I'd buy this for the $31 Amazon is asking for. What Pixar is doing is robing it's fans buy making us pay twice for the same movie and it's wrong. They should be charging $25 for this and throwing the dvd movie for free. I also noticed blu-ray has been out for a bit and the prices of new releases are going up instead of down, Star Trek, Transformers 2, Up I refuse to pay more than $25 (with free shipping and no tax) or $20 (with shipping &/or tax) for a blu-ray otherwise I will wait and buy a used copy or when it comes down in price, whichever comes first. Also what's up with the limited Edition, over $100 for the movie and what appears to be a lamp, come on really, who's stupid to fall for that?;Haven't seen it but....
13;53.0;5.0;8.0;"Carl and Ellie meet and discover they both have the same dream of becoming explorers. They see newsreels of a daring adventurer named Charles Muntz, who is accused of faking a discovery of an animal unknown to man. He goes back to Venezuela, vowing to bring back the creature he claims he saw. Nothing is heard from him in years. Carl and Ellie grow up and marry. They buy an old house and fix it up. The two save up their money to go to Paradise Falls, but end up using the money for problems in life. It's present day and Ellie has died.\n\nThis is all told in a beautiful but heart-wrenching montage that will make any human tear up. It's one of the best montage I've ever seen. However, the film focuses of Carl after the death of his wife. He is a recluse. After a problem has occurred, Carl decides to go to Venezuela, as a promise to Ellie. However, he's stuck with an 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer named Russell. Together, they embark in an adventure to a lost world, all brought to you by Pixar.\n\nSaying that ""Up"" is (yet) another masterpiece from Pixar is getting clichd by now. At this point, Pixar can do no wrong. What they have done in the past several years was bringing films for all ages to enjoy. ""Up"" is the reason why people go see movies in the first place. Compared to other animated films, ""Up"" doesn't have innuendos for the older audiences. That's because it doesn't need to. This film is fantastic for all ages, the story appealing to many more people than the last two Pixar films.\n\nThe rich story in ""Up"" may might as well be the most realistic from Pixar yet. It's poignantly told and there are things in life that are shown here that have never been shown in other animated films before. The characters are lovable and charming and are painfully and surprisingly authentic (well, except for the talking dogs, of course). The odd relationship between Carl and Russell grows as the film progresses. For the first time, the adult is smarter than the child. The film is also undeniably endearing. The film is so endearing, in fact, that you'll cry or choke up in at least three or four different spots in the film.\n\nI didn't see this film in 3D but I can tell you the film works well with or without the extra dimension aspect. The whole look of the film is just wonderful. The colors are exuberant and lively. The animation is pitch perfect. The story is nearly flawless, with some minor problems, including some talking dogs. The score by Michael Giacchino is sweet and lovely. The directing by both Pete Docter and Bob Peterson is really great. Wow, it seemed like every shot of the film moved the story along. Some scenes were hilarious too, filled with witty dialogue. The action sequences were impeccably crafted, I'll admit, including an excellent shot in the very first one.\n\nOverall, what I loved best about this movie are the characters and the story, the two most important aspects to any movie, in fact. The entire film just hits all of the right notes. With films being released these days, it's fantastic to see movies like ""Up"" are being released every once in awhile. I loved every minute of ""Up"" and I assure you will too. It's no surprise for me to say that ""Up"" is the best film of this year but I find it hard another film may be better than it.";UP Soars to New Heights!
29;54.0;1.0;8.0;"As a modern woman, I found the ending of this movie extremely offensive. Why must a ""man"" represent the explorer scout so that he can graduate when his mother was clearly available to do the job? And, on top of that, why is a child being rewarded for leaving his mother without even telling her, to go off on some reckless adventure with a geezer who for all we know could be a registered sex offender?\n\nI would not rent or purchase this film for my children, as I don't want them to grow up thinking this is (still) a man's world.

So frustrating and so disappointing.;No 3D, so they lost a sale ...
79;57.0;2.0;8.0;I took my 8 year-old son to this movie, and he claims it is the worst theater movie he'd ever seen.

12;58.0;2.0;7.0;"SPOILER ALERT\n\nAt the risk of committing heresy, I did not like this movie.\n\nA child is inspired to dream by a man, who is a world-renowned explorer and zoologist.  The child's future wife is inspired by the same man; who is tangentially responsible for the two meeting.\n\nThe explorer is then accused of faking a discovery and vows to return with a living specimen or not at all.  The children remain inspired by him, however.\n\nLife intrudes for the children who grow up, marry, grow old, and never have the chance go exploring on for themselves.  The wife eventually dies, and her husband is seemingly consigned to a life of no consequence to himself or any other.\n\nHe seizes one last chance for adventure, though, and through a series of events floats his house (and a young child) down to the location he and his wife always dreamed of.  It is still a remote jungle, full of adventure and excitement.\n\nThey discover a heretofore undiscovered species of bird, and it what should have been a powerfully emotional moment, they also find the disgraced explorer who originally inspired the now old man.  Instead, this even older man is full of hatred and bitterness for the world that rejected him oh those many years before.\n\nAnd this is what I couldn't get past.  The inspiration behind an entire life is revealed to be an empty shell and nothing is ever as it seems.";Awful story
17;59.0;2.0;7.0;"Really torn on the movie.\n\nI loved the beginning, but found myself wondering right away, ""Just how is this a kid's movie?""  The plot was just too grown-up.  Then they started haphazardly throwing in this random stuff obviously meant to amuse young children.  It was uncomfortable.\n\nDon't get me wrong.  The introduction was engrossing.  The animation was great.  Most of the characters were genuinely lovable, especially the old man and Kevin.  But in the end, it just felt like an ugly patchwork - bits and pieces were extraordinary, but ultimately, everything clashed.\n\nFor the record, I have no problem with talking animals or nonsense in a children's movie - I even expect them.  And I truly love Pixar.  But this film just didn't sit right with me.  The idea was very adult-minded, and it didn't seem like Disney quite worked out what message they wanted to send to kids.  Very confusing.\n\nAlthough I really enjoyed some parts, Up left me feeling down..";Up or Down?
8;60.0;5.0;5.0;Starts out a little depressing, but one of the few animated films these days that genuinely touch on real-life emotions.  The movie progressively gives me a warm & fuzzy feeling, and by the end you can't help but feel satisfied and thankful for what we have in our lives.;Heart-warming
10;61.0;5.0;6.0;"Probably the best animated film this decade. Up is one of those films that makes you look at yourself, at all the promises you made to yourself that one day, that magical day, when you have enough money, when you win the lottery, when you get a break in your schedule, you're going to take that trip, treat yourself out to that nice dinner you deserve, do that thing you've always planned from the time you were bold enough to dream. Once upon a time you were a cub scout, the world was a magical place awaiting exploration. Then one day you woke up, looked in the mirror, opened your front door, and realized that you were old and all you have left are memories and old pictures of the way you used to look when you were young.\n\nThis is the perfect family movie. I say this because usually when you hear the words ""family film"" it's usually a film that is very basic, basic and safe enough to take your kid to see. Rarely do you see a film that is basic enough for a kid to get into yet sophisticated enough for an adult to relate with on a level that a child who hasn't been through life's changes cannot possibly understand. Up is that type of film, about an old man holding on to the past, to an old dream, resisting the changes occurring around him. Ed Asner of Mary Tyler Moore fame plays the gruff irascible Mr. Henrick who, along with a stowaway scout named Russel set out for South America's Paradise Falls by way of a cloud of colorful balloons anchored to an old house full of old dreams.\n\nThe animation in this movie is very colorful, vibrant, realistic, and reminds me a lot of Hayao Miyazaki's films in this respect. In fact, the characterizations in this film, particularly the part played by Asner, the main character, is downright scary at times, seems like a live action movie, not because the animation's all that, but because the emotions and humanity are so damn real and don't seem forced. This, along with another one of my favorites, Wall-E, shows why America stands heads and shoulders above everybody in this medium. Sorry went on so long but there aren't enough superlatives to say how fantastic and beautiful this film is. A true work of art, art that you can feel as well as see.";For adults as well as children

(For the record, I think it's unfair to hold it against the film-makers if your very young child was upset...those ratings are given for a reason. It's up to parents to pay attention to the rating and use their common sense.)

65;66.0;5.0;7.0;My family and I are HUGE disney fans and when it comes to the animated films, we've pretty much seen them all. The problem is that as of late, with some exceptions including Bridge To Terabithia, the disney films have seemed to be lacking alot in what made them special to begin with. Up was able to bring back those heartfelt moments that had been gone for a fair amount time and for me, it was a complete throwback to movies like the little mermaid,tarzan and even the most depressing disney film, the fox and the hound, all of which had scenes of sadness,joy,family,loss...that are important for everyone to see and that bring the magic to us. I loved UP, I recommend it to everyone who's a disney fan or even if you're not, go out and buy it,rent, check it out at the library if you to because it's worth and it has quite a bunch of themes in it that you can talk about with your family once it's over.;BEST DISNEY FILM AS OF LATE

Films like Monsters Inc., Toy Story, and Finding Nemo are just some of the examples that really make this company shine. In my humble opinion, UP belongs right there with the rest of them.  This is completely different than any of the previous Pixar films but it is still a great one. Granted, this movie probably won't be as enjoyable for the kiddies but I'm sick of people trashing this movie because ""Pixar movies should make me happy all the way through."" People can't take that a cartoon can have some depth and, well, some realism. If you are looking for a slap-stick ""Kung-Fu Panda"" type movie then this one really isn't for you. It's sad, hilarious, and touching. The reviewers saying ""He had a happy life, why is he sad?"" Get back to me when you lose someone after a lifetime of being together. He watched his wife slip away while always putting off their mutual dream. People are trying to destroy his house, and he's lost the love of his life. I'd say he has the right to be upset.

81;68.0;2.0;7.0;"I have seen every Pixar movie made, in fact these are about the only movies that are actually worth the $$$ to see at the theatre rather than waiting for DVD.  Why?  because these movies always are visually spectacular and have very original and captivating plots.  With each new release I kept saying can they do it again?  and each time it is Yes!  But the streak finally ended with UP.\n\nHere the plot, while it is very original, is boring and really seems thrown together; after a while I just didn't care what happened.  First of all, the whole balloon on the house thing is unique, but where did he get the balloons and how did he put them on his house?  It goes from one day he is being sent to the nursing home and the next morning he just has 10,000 balloons coming out of his chimney.  I realize this is an animated kids movie but they should at least have shown how he did this.  Then after he is in the air, he aims compass south and a storm comes along, but then as soon as the storm clears he lands in the exact spot that he and his now deceased wife had dreamed of (the waterfall in South America).  Again, I realize its a cartoon but come on, just put some balloons on your house, take off and your automatically in the exact spot in South America that you always dreamed of?  South America is a huge continent, all he did was aim his compass to S and poof he's at the waterfall.  Like I said....thrown together.\n\nThen for what seems like eternity we watch them try to drag this house over to the waterfall itself, and this is like the whole plot of the movie.  This seems like a very weak plotline here, I mean, he made it to where he can see the waterfall, that should be enough to fulfill his dream...why does he need to drag the house over to it?  What exactly is he going to do once he gets there, just sit in the house till he dies of old age?  You really aren't that emotionally involved with his plight because it is a weak premise.  Finally the plot develops into the lost explorer and his blimp, etc. which isn't bad but comes along way too late.

14;70.0;1.0;6.0;A complete  disappointment!\nThe following has nothing to do with the movie nor the seller but with the information provided on the page.\nPersonally I have noticed as Amazon does not always fully informed about the languages and subtitles available for a film.\nIn fact and very often simply does not show any information, so I assume it is only in English, but in this case was very clear:\n\nLanguage: Franais (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), Spanish (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround)\nSubtitles: French, Spanish.\n\nBut the movie is only in English and no subtitle at all.\nI think the company should put more care into these details.\nI even think that there should be an email option in case of doubt.;Language & subtitles problem
19;71.0;1.0;6.0;Why not zero stars?  This movie is fine for my son.  I went and saw Antichrist tonight, and I was looking around at the audience and all of a sudden I thought about this movie.  Now I saw this movie on a plane, without my son.  My thought was this: I am tired of adults talking about how excellent pixar movies are.  And then I thought about adults talking about Harry Potter and Twilight, and how ... good they are.  Neither are that good, unless you haven't read Bram Stoker's Dracula or... well pick a book.  I can forgive teenagers and pre-teens for reading these books, I can't forgive adults who seem to pride themselves on their appreciation of movies that were meant for kids. There is no literary parallel.  Pixar is not to film what Watership Down is to literature.  No.  If you are an adult and Up resonates with you- then you are truly not grown UP. If you can appreciate it for your children that is different, but really - your kids don't need this. What I mean to say here is grow up.;It's time to grow up.
22;72.0;3.0;6.0;Up until now I've loved every Pixar movie I've ever seen, but this one was somewhat of a disappointment to me.  I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either.\n\nIt had a few funny moments, but overall, I found it rather sad and depressing.  It was marketed as an uproarious comedy, but somehow an old man losing his wife and being forced out of his home just aren't funny subjects.  I know sometimes in entertainment, bringing the audience down makes the funny parts seem funnier, but this movie just fell a little flat for me.\n\nA lot of the story didn't make sense.  Not that everything has to make sense, but the childhood idol of that old man should have been long-dead or at least approaching 100 years old, so the character just didn't fit.  The thing with the dogs was entertaining at times (SQUIRREL!!!) but largely didn't hit it for me either.  I've come to expect a great deal of creativity and innovation from Pixar (Monsters Inc has one of the most innovative story lines ever created) and I just didn't see the same level of that in this movie.\n\nI would give it 3.5 stars at best.;Good movie, but not what I've come to expect from Pixar
25;73.0;3.0;6.0;"The story goes that when&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Toy-Story/dp/B0030IIZ4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Toy Story</a>&nbsp;was first envisioned, it was as Yet Another of their award winning animated shorts until somewhere along in the process someone got the bright idea of turning it into Pixar's first feature.\n\nThe rest, as they say, is history.  If something similar was going on with this movie, and I suspect that it was, it is proof that longer is not always better, not even from Pixar.  They took the potential Best Animated Short EVER and turned it into a so-so 90-minute movie.\n\nThe beginning is animation and movie making at its best; the short scene depicting a lifetime of marriage with nary a word spoken may be the most emotionally moving piece of animation ever created; and the scene where the house takes flight is, figuratively and literally, the high point of the movie.  A short coda, say showing future explorers finally reaching the top of the falls and finding the house impossibly but successfully perched there, would have finished off a stunning animated short.  Pixar chose to continue on, unwisely IMHO, because once you've reached the high point the only way to go is down.\n\nThe first descent was to turn this movie into Yet Another story of an irascible old man coping with a child who fails to grasp that he isn't really wanted, hardly the most original idea, though setting it in a floating house provides some novelty.

Especially with the added poignancy of Russell's quixotic motive: winning back the love and attention of a father lost through divorce?\n\nDo you really have to ask?\n\nThe second descent was to blow away any remaining realism by introducing talking dogs and a gigantic reject from the cast of Pixar's academy-award-winning short&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/For-the-Birds/dp/B00005JKDR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">For the Birds</a>.

This mixture of darkness and light, grimness and whimsy, simply fails to work at all, not least because the villain ought to be over a hundred years old by now.\n\nFinally, this movie gets an ""F"" for its understanding of the problems of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cryptozoology/dp/0684856026/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cryptozoology</a>.

The first hunter to bring in a Bigfoot should be given a medal; the second hunter to bring in a Bigfoot should be SKINNED.

34;74.0;2.0;6.0;I had big hopes for this movie following as it did on the heels of WALL-E.  In spite of a couple of chuckles, UP lacked the charm, the plot, the suspense, the credibility, the music and, surprisingly, even the animation quality of its predecessor.  Maybe WALL-E just set the bar far too high.  One star for being 'colorful' and another for at least being better than some of the drek that's out there right now.;Meh
35;75.0;1.0;6.0;I am very upset, because my little girl and I were so excited to see this movie, and got it out of the package, and about 40 minutes into the movie, it just STOPPED. We tried it on several tv's, and nothing. There were no scratches obviously because it was brand new. So now my money is in the garbage and I had a very very disappointed child.;Disc does not work!!!!!!!!
38;76.0;2.0;6.0;"Personally, I loved ""UP.""  I thought it was a meaningful, beautiful movie.  My husband and myself especially loved the dogs!\n\nHOWEVER, it was marketed as a kid's movie.  Like, Shrek, just because something is animated does not a children's movie make!  My children are 8, 6, and 3.  I may consider letting them see it around 10 years old.\n\nProblems:\nThe long lost hero turns villain.  And, a really bad one at that.  He actually tries to murder a child, unacceptable!\n\nThe opening montage... beautiful.  BUT, a sensitive child will be very saddened by it.\n\nThe boy's father *never* shows up.  I don't care if that is reality for 50% of kids out there, mine don't need to be ""educated"" about that possibility.";NOT a children's movie
46;77.0;2.0;6.0;Rented the movie today and thought it was only OK.  Certainly didn't live up to the Pixar reputation like the Incredibles and Toy Story.  It was rather violent for an animated film and there was no solid plot to follow. Funny parts throughout the movie, but I can't see a child getting into it or being able to follow it.;not a kids movie

15;80.0;5.0;5.0;I have watched this movie now about 5 times and it is a great movie. I liked the behind the scences in the DVD. I was surprised at how the personnel involved with this movie went to alot of effort to get all the details correct. Makes me appreciate all the work it takes to make a quality movie. The DVD came in without any problems and works fine. Makes a very good gift for movie lovers.;Great Movie
32;81.0;1.0;5.0;This has to be the all time worst animated PG movie I've ever seen. It has to be the first animated movie where they show blood. Blood in a children's movie! I realize that the MPAA is nothing more than a rubber stamp for the main stream motion picture corporations. If this movie had been made by an independent it would have received a PG-13. I mean, come on, a comedy. The last half of the movie was nonstop violence. There was, one very funny part to the movie and that was the plot error and what a big error it was. The movie begins with the adventurer Charles Munts, who was maybe 40, who went to South America to find a bird. Then fast forward through Carl Fredrickson's life from a child watching the adventures of Charles Munts to old age, maybe 75 years old. Then Carl Fredrickson travels to south America and meets Charles Munts who looks younger than Carl Fredrickson. What??? Let's do the math. If Carl Fredrickson was 10 at the beginning and Charles Munts was 40 and at the end Carl was 75 then Charles would be 105.\nI would not show this movie to my kids and unless you like feeding your kids a diet of violence you shouldn't show it t yours.;violence, violence and more violence
50;82.0;2.0;5.0;This is a wonderful movie with a beautiful story, but it is not a movie for really little kids.  Our 2 year old son was in tears for much of the movie, upset with what was happening, and I am pretty sure not understanding the underlying story.  Some of the violence was a bit too much, with the villian shooting at the kid at one point. Again, I thought it was a good movie, but not for the same audience as Finding Nemo or Monsters Inc.;Not for little kids
51;83.0;3.0;5.0;I never got around to seeing this movie in the theater.  I purchased this movie and watched it at home.  From the commercials it looked like a fun uplifting movie for all ages.  They never gave any indication that the movie was very sad and heart-wrenching. I didn't expect it to be so sad. Not to mention that the villain was a little creepy.  That part may be a little scary for some kids.  The dogs were very anoying and so was the bird. Parents may have some explaining to do during and after this movie (death, cancer, grief, miscarriage, why the villain is shooting at a kid). I'm not saying I didn't like the movie.  I did.  But I think Disney could have marketed it differently. I think parents should view it with their small children.  It's a very sad movie with a happy ending, but the events may be a little to difficult for small children to understand.\nThe animation was fantastic. But the story left a little to be desired.;Not Quite What I Expected
56;84.0;2.0;5.0;It is a great implementation of art and graphics, and the story moves along smoothly. Unfortunately, this success is bounded by a sad drama that is unnecessary to the story, and darkens the mood. It would have been a great movie without the darkness.;Great Art and Execution, But Sad Drama.
59;85.0;3.0;5.0;"I know I will probably be critizised for this review since everyone else thinks this movie was genius and I don't, but frankly I don't care. Let's review.\n\nThe Movie: The previews for this movie didn't grab my attention right away like the ones for Monsters Vs Aliens, Ice Age 3, and other awesome summer movies. But when everyone kept saying how great this movie was, I was pulled into the hype and rented it. I originally thought this movie would be another dissapointment just like the last two Disney movies I saw (Bolt (SUCKED!) and Walle (Okay)), but surprisingly, it wasn't. This movie had it's moments, and like everyone said, the animation was amazing (even if they still can't make humans as good as Dreamworks). This movie entertained me, but not as much as the two awesome movies I mentioned before that I saw this summer. It had a fairly good plot, and it did make me tear up a little bit. It was a good movie, but not as good as say Cars, Ratatouille, or Monsters Inc. Those are Pixar classics, this is just a good movie. I'd give the movie a 7.5, maybe an 8, out of ten. It's definately worth seeing once.\n\nThe Dvd: OMG. The DVD starts out with an ad from Pixar. Not just a movie preview or an ad for other movies, but an actual ad! It's just some bs from a bunch of Pixar workers saying how you should get the two disc dvd, the toys, games and books based on this movie, and a bunch of other crap. They're basically saying ""You won't have fun with this dvd, go out and spend more money on the two disc dvd just so you can actually have some bonus features). Nice job Pixar (sarcasm). Speaking of which, this dvd has NOTHING! It doesn't just have no bonus features it had no menu what so ever. I couldn't believe it when the dvd went from previews to the movie in two seconds with no warning what so ever. There's no menu, which means if you need captions, a different language, or you need to go straight to a scene, you're basically screwed if you buy this dvd! No menu?! Come on Pixar, or were you two busy making sellout commercials to make a menu?!\n\nOverall: The movie was good, but do not, I repeat DO NOT buy this crappy, no menu dvd! It's crappy, and it's only worth the rental price of $4, maybe not even that! Pixar, do you really think you can make people buy your two disc dvds just so they can get a basic menu?! Not cool!\n\nMovie: 7.5/10\nDvd: 0/10 (stay away from it! Just watch the movie on youtube!)";Okay Movie, Horrible Dvd!
62;86.0;5.0;5.0;Anyone who has ever seen a PIXAR movie knows that the brilliant people behind the computers make movie enjoyable by everyone! That's right, a kid's movie enjoyable by an adult but with no inapropriate humor to make it happen. Everyone likes PIXAR movies. Even angsty emo teenagers who grumble through the whole thing are secretly touched by their honest storytelling.\n\nI've had the same boyfriend for 5 years neow and I have never ONCE seen him cry in a movie. I, on the other hand, cry at the drop of the hat. Of course I'm crying through the for 5 minutes of the movie, but I look over at my boyfriend and see *GASP* he too is crying! But don't worry parents! This movie is not overly sad. PIXAR knows what is neccisary in a story and how to tell it tastefully. The first 5 - 10 minutes is rather sad, but it is a natural part of life.\n\nOf course the rest of the movie is pure genius. I'm always surrounded by dogs and they nailed the personality of the dogs perfectly. From their frequent distractions to their frightening intensity when on the hunt. Kevin is also delightful and the boy is easy to relate to.\n\nThe only thing that really shocked me in this movie was the demise of the villan. ***SPOILER*** I am terrified by heights and when I watched him slide of the side of the balloon and fall to the earth I felt my stomach go somewhere far away ***SPOILER*** While this is rather shocking it's really the only way for this story to end.\n\nPeople with younger kids may find themselves explaining death to their toddler, but this is a talk we all need to have with out kids at some point. Other than that, UP! was delightful! I laughed, I cried, I found myself quoting the movie for many months afterwards. Thank you John Lasseter;Lets go fly a House
73;87.0;5.0;5.0;"Someday, Pixar is going to do it -- they're going to create an emotionally uninspiring, lackluster animated movie.\n\nBut in the meantime, they're still putting out delightful for-all-ages animated movies like ""Up,"" which defies the usual kid-movie conventions by starring a crotchety seventysomething old man. It's a charming, fun little adventure story with flying dogs and balloon-powered houses, but underlying it is a bittersweet little message about not letting the present be bogged down by the past.\n\nAs a child, the shy Carl Fredricksen bonded with the oddball Ellie over their shared love of adventure, the explorer Charles Muntz, and Paradise Falls. They later married, move into their ""clubhouse"" together, and lived a long but sadly childless life together -- and when Ellie died, she had never fulfilled her dream of going to Paradise Falls.\n\nNow crotchety, alone and harassed by a real estate developer, Carl (Ed Asner) is finally ordered to a retirement home. But he isn't about to go quietly -- instead he attaches thousands of balloons to his house and floats it away in the general direction of South America. But he accidentally takes an enthusiastic, naive Wilderness Explorer (a thinly-veiled Boy Scout) named Russell (Jordan Nagai) along for the ride. Poor kid was just trying to earn an ""assisting the elderly"" badge.\n\nBut the jungle trek to Paradise Falls turns out to have some surprising obstacles: a big emulike bird that Russell names Kevin, a talking dog named Dug (""I am jumping on you, bird!""), and a mysterious old man who lives deep in the heart of the jungle. Turns out the old guy is very familiar to Carl -- and to capture Kevin, he's willing to sacrifice Carl and Russell.\n\nIndustry experts were babbling about how ""Up"" wouldn't be as popular as the previous Pixar movies, because the protagonist is basically a crusty old coot. Well, that shows what they know. It ended up becoming one of those classic movies that somehow appeals to all ages -- while the humor and action appeal to children, adults can appreciate Carl's love for his lost wife, and his slow realization that he's clinging to the past.\n\nIn fact, the first ten minutes are some of the most heart-tugging, quietly bittersweet scenes I've seen in a long time. Without a word, they show all the ups and downs of a realistic marriage -- joys, sorrows (Ellie's inability to have children), growing old together, and finally loss.\n\nBut it's not a depressing movie by any stretch -- in fact, it's like a childhood fantasy come to life, complete with a floating house suspended on hundreds of balloons, and biplanes piloted by a talking dog army.. Plenty of great dialogue (""Do you want to play a game? It's called See Who Can Go the Longest Without Saying Anything."" ""Cool! My mom loves that game!"") and an action-packed climax in an aged airship.\n\nEd Asner is absolutely perfect as the ubergrouch Carl -- crotchety, grumpy, and determined to fulfill his beloved wife's lifelong dream, but gradually realizing that what he's really clinging to is his past. Jordan Nagai is equally perfect as Carl's polar opposite: a naive, sweetly chattery Wilderness Scout who is determined to reunite Kevin with her baby chicks. He's really just a sweetie-pie.\n\nAnd the utterly adorable Dug and the other dogs deserve special notice. These creatures are utterly hilarious -- they talk (""I hid under your porch because I love you"") and act (""Scream all you want, small mailman!"") the way dogs would if they talked. Three words: cone of shame.\n\n""Up"" continues Pixar's running tally of gloriously animated, emotionally layered movies that the entire family can enjoy. With that, I have only one more thing to say... SQUIRREL!";SQUIRREL!
80;88.0;4.0;5.0;Pixar keeps raising the bar - and this time it's Up. This joyous fantasy creates a very odd couple indeed. An iconic grumpy old man and a congenitally cheerful and sincere little boy launch onto an adventure blended from equal parts past (the old guy's) and future (the kid's). There's bit of an eco-fable in there, with the big bad urban developers and the rapacious hunter, but that never becomes annoying. Instead, Up keeps delivering wild sight gags layered on appealing interactions between the characters. Speaking of characters (and speaking of them speaking), Dug the dog is way up on my list of favorites. If you never learned to love dog-drool as a child, he might not hit a heart-string - but that's your problem, not mine.\n\nI'm sure others will tell you about the rest of the movie, but two parts really stood out for me: the first five minutes, and the ten minutes (or so) before that. Those first few minutes of the movie create a charming back-story with more plot and heart than a lot of movies manage in an hour or two. They define The Quest that the rest of the movie pursues, so effectively that you'll never question any silliness in pursuing it. But, before the first minutes of this movie, Pixar presents one of their signature short features. This time - well, it would take longer to tell than to watch. It's about the stork who delivers the babies. It carries an affectionate reminder that some are harder to love than others, but that just makes the job that much more important.\n\n-- wiredweird\n\n(PS: Note how much more limber and energetic the old guy gets as he spends more time with that earnest little boy - that part of the movie is absolute non-fiction. Young kinds make you younger.);Away!

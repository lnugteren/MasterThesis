63;1.0;5.0;295.0;I started out with a Palm III, switched to a handheld PC and am now back with the Palm V.  For the everyday person it's more than enough.  I didn't buy it to play games with - I bought it to stay organized.  The extreme  ease of use is wonderful and syncing to your PC is a breeze.  Anybody that  needs more than this needs a handheld PC (Which have their own combersome  problems!)  I have found the OS platform with the Palm V much easier to  sync with my desktop - especially with WindowsNT.  Too many problems  connecting with WindowsCE.  The Palm V has far exceeded my needs and is  perfect for the everyday user looking for a palm organizer that is just  that, an organizer and 24hr assistant.;MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR THE EVERYDAY USER
65;2.0;3.0;275.0;If you look at the Palm V and the Palm IIIx you will notice some major differences. First of all, the V is smaller, and looks cooler. However, the benefits end there. The V has half the RAM of the IIIx, which, as a  seasoned pilot user, i know you will really want if you get into modems and  telnet shells and mail and real-time web browsing. (not to mention games) I  would suggest forgoing the looks for the functionality (something that is  not done enough in our corporate world) and getting the IIIx. You will not  regret it. However, if you have to have something shiny, by all means, this  is the machine to get....;Problems With the Palm V
39;3.0;5.0;173.0;I spent about 2 months trying to decide whether an organizer could be worth this much money.  I just bought my Palm V last week, and it's hard to imagine life without it now.  The Palm V is simply the best purchase I've made in a long time. It's an incredibly small and sleek little machine.  It  fits right in your shirt pocket, even with the hard case I bought for it.  It has all the standard things you'd expect from an organizer (address  book, to do list, agenda, expense report).  The Graffiti system (writing  instead of typing) only takes a little while to get used to.  The Palm  Desktop software and cradle allows you to back everything up in a few  seconds.  No batteries are necessary, because you can recharge the Palm Vin  the cradle.  Hundreds of extra programs and games can be downloaded. If  you're trying to decide which Palm to buy, I definitely recommend the V.  The Vx is about the same, but it has more memory (which I don't think I'll  need) and costs a lot more, the III series is great but not as sleek, and  the VII has the built-in modem, which doesn't interest me much.  Go for the  Palm V.  If you're trying to decide whether it's worth the money, the  answer is a resounding YES!;Amazing!
60;4.0;1.0;170.0;Apparently when it works this is a great thing to have! I got a bad unit and did everything to get it to work properly, but the unit simply did not work and froze all the time. Called Palm, they were very eager to replace  it with a refurbished unit, which is no bad but not what I expected or paid  for. I bought this for convinience, but has only been a problem and a waste  of my time. I am not giving up yet though, I have asked Amazon to replace  the unit. Will see what happens!;Bad unit
0;5.0;4.0;5.0;This was one of Palm's real groundbreaking handhelds, with it's sleek case and low weight.  Still a great handheld but only has 2 MB of memory and lacks the SD slot that the new Palms are being manufactured with.  If you just need a calendar and address book, this will do it, but the m100 will do just about the same (...)(with albeit a much smaller screen).  The backlight on the Palm V is woeful like the backlights on all Palms, but is not needed too often.;The classic Palm
53;6.0;3.0;134.0;The Palm V I bought came bundled with the Franklin Covey Planner software, which is pretty good stuff. However, a few things come out after you install everything and start to use it. I like the ability to enter data from my computer - I type better there, and being able to communicate with  the computer from the Palm speeds up collection of  business data. But they  don't tell you up front that none of your expense data will be collected if  you don't have Excell software in your machine, - I've been using Lotus 123  and MS Works for years now, and can't get anyting from a Palm V into either  without creating a spredsheet and entering each and every number manually.  Another problem is that you must load BOTH the Franklin Planner AND the  Palm Planner software, and Synch twice to get everything from the Palm into  the computer. The Franklin accepts no expense data and the Palm software  takes no Time schedules. Finally when the Palm is cold - left in briefcase  in car trunk overnight - the tap with the stylus doesn't always work or is  off by a line or two, creating frustrating re-entry situations.  It could  be an excellent aid to a small businessman like myself if it didn't take so  many iterations and buying additional software to be able to communicate  with my computer.;More Development needed
49;7.0;3.0;130.0;I finally decided to spend the extra $$ for the Palm V and give my old Palm III to my dad.  Afterall, I loved the styling, but more importantly wanted the slimmer size.\nUnfortunately, when you use the hard cover that comes with the Palm V and put it in your pocket, it causes the power button  to turn on and then the up/down key constantly clicks.  Huh?\nSo then I  went out and got the hard case (a rip off if you ask me), causing the  Palm V to be just as thick as my Palm III.  That left me wondering why I  bothered spending all that extra money to get a Palm no smaller than the  one I already had.\nDad, can I get my Palm III back?;Great style, but an important flaw
69;8.0;4.0;132.0;"I've had my Palm V since June 1st. To my brother, wife & parents who conspired for my birthday: THANK YOU!!!!!  Within two weeks I abandoned my Franklin Planner, and regretted not having had a Palm device 15 years ago.  OK, that was impossible - but it has dramatically changed my life for the  better, and I can't imagine ever going without it. In the last several  months I have grown to be a very definite power user, and the corporate  resource person for Palm-platform PDA's. Our guys have tried several others  and are convinced that the Palm platform is the best and most flexible.  I  am very heavily into 3rd-party software evaluation (& some  accessories), preparing recommendations for high-efficiency Palm  device/software packages for company-staff issue. Eventually I may put  together my own personal web-site, and post some evaluations and  recommendations for software/accessories for Palm users.\nHaving said all  that, here's an engineer's (my)perspective on the Palm V: Visors will be  great, and Palm IIIx's are just fine, but the Palm V package size is  definitely worth a lot to me. Forget the sexy appearance - it's great, but  the superior Form Factor rules. Yes, I would prefer that the Vx cost is  about what the standard V discounts for now, but since it will ALWAYS fit  in my shirt pocket (without changing my shirt wardrobe) I ALWAYS have it  with me (in a place that's probably least susceptible to being damaged or  lost) - and that's what it's for. Though I prefer to use the slim padded  3COM case, I frequently slip the original leather flap-cover on for small  shirt pockets, & thus can still carry a separate pen/pencil/stylus  device. A big plus with those covers that I've never seen in a review: the  soft ""grabby"" texture of the rubber-like spine flex keeps the Palm from  sliding, even if you do toe-touches. Ta-dah... it doesn't fall out on the  floor!!!!  (Very big benefit since the cover isn't a padded case.)\nLikes:  I like being able to keep synced with both my office laptop and my home  desktop (with the included MS Outlook Conduit)... autocharging in the docking  cradle... a battery that's never gotten below a half-charge... nice screen...  the size.  I really like the unit overall - a truly great device.\nAny  problems? Yep. I did have to get the updated e-mail patch from the Chapura  site to avoid some lock-ups when synching e-mail.  Also, I highly recommend  TealScript (the custom-tailorable graffitti add-on) for it's ability to  help you tune up your handwriting speed/recognition - and it visually  showed up a mysterious problem with the screen occasionally screwing up  handwriting by adding a horizontal line: 3-COM quickly replaced it under  warranty, and it's been fine.\nMemory space? The average user probably  will have no problem for a couple of years - I've met people with III's  that are using less than 1k... a year after they get it: they've seen &  use very few aftermarket programs. However, I've got more programs in there  than will fit: launcher, datebook, calc & memo replacements, travel  programs, doc reader, picture viewer, several clocks, a dozen utility and  security programs, over a dozen Hackmaster hacks, and a few games. Since  FlashPro gave me the extra 800k memory room (awesome), I found I probably  had enough that I could otherwise get by fine without deleting rarely-used  fluff programs - except that I use it heavily for work & software  evaluation. The memory room of the Vx would be heaven - the perfect device,  I think. It'd be handy to carry a lot of maps, but my current standard P5  doesn't have the memory room without deleting, say, my picture viewer. (Oh,  the screen? It's great! Yes folks, it IS a 16 greyscale display!) Probably  I'll upgrade to the Vx & give my wife my standard V (P5) unit: she  thought it was no big deal when I got it, but has fallen in love with the  capabilities and wants her own Palm device. Bottom line is that if you're a  minimalist, the 2k of P5 memory is fine. But if you like to carry a  Gerber/Leatherman/Swiss-Army device (like I do) because a pocketknife  leaves you unprepared... better get a Vx or get the 8mb upgrade on your  P5.\nPrice? When Handspring comes out with something to compete with a Vx,  the price world will probably be great. Yeh, P5's are expensive compared to  some of the lesser PDA's - but compare the price to a palmtop computer, and  they look like a great deal... especially considering the impact on your  lifestyle.\nCan I mention my essential add-on programs list? Tough area,  but currently I wouldn't give up these - listed in order of descending  requirement: UnDupe (get it!), TealScript, Travel Clock, Hackmaster,  (SwitchHack, StayOffHack, PalmV hack, Invert Hack & Invert, FindHack,  CatHack), DateBK3 (& dbScan), BackupBuddy, IDPalm, FlashPro, a good  launcher - either Commander or LaunchEm have too many great enhancements to  do without. Must-have accessories: WriteRight screen covers, Throttle  Stylus/pen. I regard the PalmV hack and StayOff hack as absolute essentials  for Palm V users, and Invert with InvertHack give proper screen display  when the backlight's on.  In-depth info?  O'Reilly's ""Palmpilot: The  Ultimate Guide"" is a fantastic reference for ALL Palm owners.";Awesome product, but larger memory of the Palm Vx is welcome
40;9.0;5.0;121.0;January 15, 2000  3Com's Palm PDA's are definitely the best PDA's on the market. You  can read the other reviews to hear how this device will help you organize  your life and how wonderful it is. As a Palm collector (I have all Palm  and Pilot models), I will rather compare the Palm V to the  Palm Vx. The  only difference between the two is that  the V has 2MB of RAM, while  the Vx has 8.\n  I have thousands of addresses, thousands of appointments, and  many  more to-do items, documents, etc. in my Palm. I  also have fax, e-mail,  and internet software  installed, among many other programs. I only use  about  1.5 MB. Therefore, although I have the Vx, I don't use any of the  additional memory. Technically, because of the additional  memory, the  Vx is faster. Nonetheless, because Palm  applications are so small, this  difference is truly  negligible. Therefore, before you spend $100 more on  the Vx, make sure you're going to use the additional memory. It's the  only difference.\n  Now, remember: the V  series is rechargable, while the III series uses  AAA  batteries. Therefore, travelling with a V palm means you'll have to  carry around the cradle. If you'd rather use batteries, maybe  the IIIx is  better for you.\n  Good luck!;Magnificent!
61;10.0;5.0;121.0;I know probably many of you have that same question.  Let meanswer it--Palm V--period.  I know the 2Meg complaints-you won't useit, and if you need to buy a Vx.  The size is amazing.  The V is soooo neat and small.\nThe unit is rock solid and I'm so happy with it. This is my first PDA and I'm thrilled I purchased the V.  The IIIx is too large and not really portable.\nDo yourself a favor--buy the V. Remember you get what you pay for.;To Palm V or IIIx
62;11.0;4.0;118.0;"I got the Palm V because I'm the kinda person who gets sucked into getting something just because they're ""new.""  This is not always the right thing to do... however.  To be sure the Palm V is a smaller version  of the Palm III.  But as far as power goes the Palm III is still the way to  go.  So if you're just a casual user of the Palm the V will give you that  wow factor... but if it's pure functionality (is that a real word?) that  you need then the III is still the better choice!";Maybe yes... Maybe no
36;12.0;2.0;74.0;I agree that Palm Pilot is a good product. It did help me have everything properly organized... while it lasted. I had a minor problem with it four months ago, and I have been completely unable to have it repaired. Client  support numbers won't answer to phone or email requests. Technical support  is just never available. I have not been able to use my palm pilot for over  4 months. The product might be good, but I do not think it is worth taking  the risk of ending up using your old paper agenda.;Good product, but very poor client support
66;13.0;4.0;75.0;This small peace of equipment has made life much easier for me in the past months. While in meetings, I can take notes, with the grafitti option. I can immediately add tasks to my to do list, while still in the meeting. This  small friend reminds me to call home, writea letter or to make a phone  call, while busy working. I write letters,compose email when the issue  comes up, and send them in the evening. appointments my secretary makes in  my desktop computer are automatically transfered in a matter of seconds, to  my palm V and vice versa, so that we have the same appointment information.  I can go on for some time, but in short I'll say: this is an improvement of  working life, I have never experienced before. and it is beautiful too. I  have a few wishes though. maybe the screen could have another type of  lighting in the future and maybe the company could add sketching options.  it would be nice to see the grafitti letters forming, like in some other  palm computers I have seen. you have five stars and four stars. I would  like to give it four and a half. when the improvements I mentionde will be  implemented, it will be a five star for me! other palms I have seen I rated  only three, because they are bulky and the display is not as simple as that  of the palmV and the problem with the batteries is for always over with  your palm V;palm V priceless companion for busy women
35;14.0;3.0;68.0;I have found my Palm V to augment my daily life and help organize a very hectic schedule.  However, the unit broke after three months and trying to get support is like pulling teeth.  They do a good job of marketing and a  lousy job of custmer satisfaction.  Looks like I will take my business  elsewhere in the future.  I feel like I am dealing with a group of snake  oil salesmen!;Lackluster Customer Support
30;15.0;5.0;66.0;A quick take on my perception of the good and bad points of this device, and some suggestions from a vetran Palm upgrader (I've returned and repruchased these machines a little too many times!)\nThere are a few  things I love about this device:\n1. You don't end up changing batteries  all the time like you did with previouis models 2. It costs lesser than the  Palm Vx 3. Synchronization with outlook 2000 is flawless 4. The screen is  very readable in bright outdoors 5. The battery lasts and lasts (they  aren't energizer bunnies!)\nThings I do not like about this:\n1. The  choice of cases for this are kind of lousy. 2. Applications built into this  device could have been a little more intuitive.\nOverall perceptions:\n1.  Good value for the money 2. Buy a spare docking cradle if you move this  between home and work PCs (accompany sells them for dirt cheap if you are  in the right buying cycle) 3. Do not attempt to browse the Web on  this...you'll only be disappointed.;Excellent synchronization, good software,good bang for the $
42;16.0;4.0;69.0;I love the great design of Palm V, this is my first palm and now I use it all the time to organize my schedule.\nMEMORY : Palm V provides only 2 MB of memory, which is one of the major drawbacks.  Installing all the  softwares that I needed took about 1.2MB, left me about 0.8MB for data and  stuffs. (btw there are lots of great freeware available which most I found  are better than the correspondence shareware)\nBATTERY PROBLEM : 3COM  advertised that one charge will last about 1 months, only true if you don't  use it regularly or  you use your cradle everyday to charge it. (it also  takes about 45 minutes to 1 hour to charge in cradle daily) One charge last  less than 2 or 3 days for me, well I almost use it most the time, organize  my schedule, expense, and playing games while waiting for my  appointment.\nPC ORIENTED : Palm products are also PC oriented, I use unix  systems most the time, and use my PC just to charge or synchonize with the  palm.  (it will be nice if they can provide a unix compatible cradle)  Anyway inspite of all the drawbacks, I love the Palm V, go get your own and  you will feel becoming a different person.\nSEVERAL ADVICES: 1. check for  available freeware b4 you buy the shareware version. 2. You will need at  least a slim leather case. (the one coming with Palm V, cause more problems  than the benefits like the never off beeping) 3. Buy Palm Vx if you have  more money. 4. If you decide to buy a Palm or its accesories, always search  the net first, don't buy at the first place you found it.  You might end up  paying 20%-50% off in other place.;great design and low of memory and battery.
45;17.0;3.0;65.0;"I own a Palm V for more than 6 months and watched my initial expectations gradually fade away. Not that this shiny gadget is a failure, but people (and maybe the marketers [!]) pushed it up to a ""carry-your-life-in-your-pocket"" position.\nDespite the  -reasonable- limitations of its size, Palm V does more than a good job. Its  own Graffiti pen-based input interface is acceptable and fast, the  operating sytem easy to use and failure-proof. You can find loads of  software, most for free, at your convenience on the web, while the ones  that already come with the unit would let you carry out any daily  organizing and recording task. With the HotSynch craddle, charging and  synchronizing , -even with Microsoft Outlook,- are almost effortless. When  charged the unit almost keep working forever (I could not test it to  exhaustion yet!). The infrared support adds to all that.\nNow about my  expectations fading away...\nPlay with a color, Windows CE based palmtop,  and the idea to carry a heavier and short-breathed box in your pocket would  probably seem to be an idea. I carried my Palm V with me during long  business trips, playing around on spreadsheets and trying to read books I  had downloaded. After at most 20 minutes of staring at that dull green and  dark olive screen, I shut it off and never touched it for at least another  day. Games? Remember your Nintendo days where they had those Gameboys?  Don't expect any better. And sound (not beeps) is yet to come in future  episodes!\nIf Palm is intended for packing your organizer data in and  taking it out on the road, than it does it. And with the software you would  find, it even would act like a remote control or a full-featured scientific  calculator. I actually did not ever bother with sending e-mail using it,  and would not since I would have to connect it to a wall outlet around  which I could have found a connected desktop or a laptop 99% of the times!  And, services for Palm VII are not yet available in Istanbul. But having my  Palm V charged with a map and a guide at TeleComm '99 in Geneva was quite a  good surprise: Having a Palm means to be the part of an evergrowing  community, for which services and facilities also grow. And so it goes  on...\nHere is the deal...\nIf you look for a marvel a quarter the size  of your laptop to replace it, than wait for another season or you'd better  go for a slightly more expensive Windows CE color device like one from the  Cassiopea C-100 series. However, in that latter case you'd end up charging  your palmtop at every stop you would find and wait for the files to pop-up  forever!\nIf you look for a sturdy and stylish organizer with easy  loading and interface, a notepad at your fingertips witout the hassle of  pen and paper and with thousands of pages of capacity, that Palm V is what  you are looking for (if you are willing to pay all that money for only  that).\nWell it can do more than that, but that would be like a  3-year-old boy acting like his dad, even with all that software around...";Shines like a star, acts like a stuntman...
51;18.0;5.0;62.0;"Just a quick comment as most of what you read hear correctly talks about the Palm V as a fantastic tool.  There is no reason to keep the Franklin Covey Planner Software (unless you are really attached to it), especially  if you have the Microsoft office suite. The ability to ""hot  synch"" the appointments, addresses, to do lists, and memo pads on the  Palm V and a PC gives you amazing flexibility. I have the cradle attached  to my PC at work and use a travel kit to synch up my work laptop and my  home desktop (yep, I do have to many computers). So I enter the data into  my Palm V once and then hot synch each of the computers as necessary.  You  also can ""beam"" any of the information from one Palm to another  Palm. Forget business cards, first see if the person has a Palm and you can  beam it to them. You can beam addresses, meetings, you name it. There are  numerous types of software that you can add to your Palm. Some is  shareware, some you purchase. I have a scientific calculator software on  mine (it comes with a basic calculator already loaded) so that I don't have  to carry a calculator in addition to the Palm V.  Basically, this tool can  do the job. I highly recommend it to the business person (small or large  business), the student, the parent, or anyone.";Step aside Franklin Planner!
15;19.0;4.0;47.0;I bought one of these several months ago, and it's truly helped me get and stay organized. I always have the numbers I need with me, I'm never (well, almost never) late for meetings, and the calculater and other features are  handy. Unfortunately, I did start to have problems with the Palm a few  weeks ago. It was not responding to the taps with the stylus. This can be  pretty frustrating when your trying to retrieve information in the field.  Once notified, however, 3Com will quickly ship out a refurbished Palm to  replace the faulty one and they also send a preposted box to ship back the  damaged Palm and no cost to you. That goes a long way in diminishing any  frustrations. Unfortunately, I am starting to experience the same problem  with my new/refurbished Palm. As much as I depend on this great little  machine, I hope this is not a trend.;I love it, but. . .
47;20.0;2.0;51.0;Like everyone else (I guess) I was seduced by that small bullet colored case that could fit in my shirt pocket.  The conventional wisdom said that if you want a PDA, get a Palm V.  At first I was excited but then saw that  you could only do a few essential items and the screen was impossible to  see.  Also, the buttons always get mashed when it sits in your suit jacket  so that the battery gets wasted.  When I saw a friend's CE based PDA with  full color and multimedia, I started surfing for one of those.  I hope Palm  beefs up the processor and the screen to come up with some less drowsy  applications--then they'll really have something. Until then, I think  they're doing Bill Gates a favor.;Where's The Beef?
26;21.0;4.0;45.0;"Immediately discovered the Palm V's memory is not sufficient tohotsynch the data I wanted to keep handy. Email alone used up so muchmemory (especially those with attachments that I can't open anyway); so I had to either be more conscientious in filing and deleting emails, or disengage the email hotsynch function. I disengaged.\nFound through various sources that there are several places to upgrade Palms; and one of the top-rated is palmpilotupgrade.com. Hallelujah! With the upgrade, my Palm V is virtually the equivalent of the Palm Vx.\nI've been using Microsoft Outlook for a long time, and it contains all kinds of important data. I didn't want to switch, so I was happy that Palm now accommodates Outlook.  END";Need More Memory
70;22.0;4.0;50.0;I have always used the Apple Newton Message Pad 2000, but the size and weight has forced me to look elsewhere. From my several years of experience using a PDA, I have found that at the most I use the PDA as an address book  and scheduler. Every where I travel these days, I can get internet  connection, so I do no need internet connection on my PDA to check  mail.\nOverall - Palm V is an excellent product\nCons:\n1. The backlight  leaves much to be desired, I just cannot get used to it when I compare it  with the Newton.  2. The screen is very reflective. 3. It lacks a few  polished applications such as a world clock, a currency converter, even the  built in country list is incomplete. Example no mention of any middle east  countries where I am currently working as a consultant. The expense program  leaves much to be desired. 4. No built in modem 5. No voice recorder 6.  Leather cover is cheap and detracts the overall quality of the  product.\nPros:\n1. Weight and size - five star here! 2. Clarity of text  excellent under full light. 3. Graifiti gives better accuracy than the  newton free style writing. 4. Hot Sync works with Microsoft Outlook! -  nothing short of briliant 5. Long battery life ie when fully charged 6.  Single base unit for charger and hotsync.\nI bought my unit in England and  as such the adaptor is auto voltage! and comes complete with different plug  adaptors.;From Apple Newton Message Pad to Palm V
57;23.0;5.0;43.0;Ive gone from the palmpilot pro two years ago to the palm III and now have the Palm V, so I definitely appreciate how small and thin the V is, and how much clearer the screen is than on the previous models. A few months ago my  palm V fell from a stack of books on to the floor face down, shattering the  screen.  I called 3com, and they charged me 100 dollars to replace it, and  sent a refurbished one that came in two days.  I was satisfied with the  process, and its good to know that they understand how important it is to  be back in action fast as possible.\nThe leather flip cover that comes  with the V works very well to protect the screen while in your pocket, and  eventually begins to have the comforting worn leather feel of a wallet,  which adds to the over aesthetics of this product.  A less obscure point is  that it becomes very easy to get attached to carrying the palm V around  just as much as you carry a wallet.\nI can use the infrared port on the  palm V to connect to my GSM phone (ericsson i888 on omnipoint), and get  regular internet access.  (requires proxinet, irdalink software, and a  standard isp).  Its not the most functional thing in the world- but it  actually works.  There is so much good shareware out there for the palm  (tetris, document readers and books, finance calcs, customizing hacks  etc.), and even a computer novice can easily learn how to download and  install new programs with relative ease.;Unlike AOL, the palm is number 1 for a good reason.
21;24.0;5.0;35.0;"Using my Palm V always makes me smile because it is about as close to perfect as any electronic device I've ever used.\nIf anyone is on the borderline, not sure if a PDA is for them, this device will not disappoint.  It does everything that you'd want it to do, does it well, and does it  quickly.  Plus the ability to sync the Palm V with your computer's PIM  (inc. Microsoft Outlook) makes importing and exporting contacts a  breeze.\nIf you're not sure about the Graffiti writing system, I can tell  you that it's a very easy to learn.  Five minutes worth of practicing and  you'll have it down (it's very, very close to the normal alphabet).  After  a few days you'll have it completely memorized (the Palm folks also include  a handy ""cheat sheet"" sticker that you can stick to the inside of  the cover that's included with the Palm V).\nAs someone who bought an  Apple Newton MessagePad (and lived though that debacle) I can say from  experience that the Palm is not a product that only a geek can love.  Anyone who is busy and wants to be able to keep track of contacts and  appointments will find this device invaluable and I sincerely mean that.  Once you have one you will not want to be without it, and it sure beats  hauling a fat old paper based organizer around.\nSome quick notes; the  Palm V Hard Case rocks!  If you travel a lot make sure to get one.  It  keeps the Palm V completely safe from harm and looks beautiful.  Also, with  the upgrade to Palm OS 3.3, you'll be able to sync your Palm with any  laptop with an infrared port without the need for any cables.  This is  very, very cool and very useful for road warriors (one caveat here, the IR  sync does not yet work on Windows2000 based systems).\nHope this helps!";An Incredible Combo of Form and Function...

54;28.0;5.0;34.0;I have had both the Palm V and the Handspring Visor.  I gave my beyfriend the palm V.  It is the sleekest, nicest PDA on the market no doubt.  The screen clarity is FAR BETTER than the palm III, and the slightest bit better than my visor.  The visors applications (datebk, clock and calc) are  better. Then buy the software called Datebk3 and walla!  The battery on the palm (lithion) far better than the others.  If it's too much money, go for the Visor over the Palm III. MUCH BETTER!;Best PDA - not as expensive as you think.
41;29.0;5.0;33.0;I needed one centralized location for all my information, especially appointments and phone numbers.  The Palm V has given me exactly that.  I've installed a couple of shareware applications, but have not found that  I use them, so the 2 MB memory is going to be fine for me.  The interface  is elegant and simple, and it's easy to input data with the stylus.  After  using the included cover, and then trying the leather case, I finally ended  up with the hard case, and I like it the best.  All the Palm users who talk  about how it has changed their lives are not just blowing smoke.... this  device has succeeded where countless paper organizers and calendars have  failed.  And it's fun, and looks cool!;I'm finally organized
58;30.0;4.0;33.0;"Although the Palm V is more appealing than the III it's essentially the same technology. I've had one wear out and die, another just fail and ""reboot"" itself alot, another fail from getting a little wet. I  love these things but for me the extra $150 for the V translates into $175  per year vs $100 per year, assuming it lasts two years.";Remember, these things break.
25;31.0;5.0;29.0;On the advice of my friend, I bought the Palm V and now I can see why he likes his so much. It's turned out to be very useful. No more forgetting tasks or being late to appointments. Anytime I need to jot something down,  i can just whip it out and start writing. And the games help pass the time  when you have nothing to do.\nTo the reviewer who said a notepad and a pen  was the equivalent, you have no idea what you're missing.  The Palm is so  much more than a notepad, it also has games, a calendar, to do lists, an  address book, calculator, and anything else you want to load onto it. I'd  like to see something made of paper as compact as the palm that could hold  as much information and deliver it as easily.;Don't know how I did without it
19;32.0;3.0;28.0;A pretty good device overall, but one thing really bugs me.  I have it in a leather case.  I was carrying it in my hand one day and I dropped it.  Only one exposed area got a tiny speck of a nick, but the rest of the  device was cushioned by the leather.  That incident caused all the screen  touch points to drop.  In order to activiate something, I have to touch  below where it is displayed on the screen.  The functions on the bottom  moved almost completely out of range, and the writing area shifted down  also.  I can't tell if it's because the writing area shifted downwards, but  the graffiti recognition is slower and less accurate too.  I can't say  anything else bad about it, but what a letdown to know that it can't take  simple impacts.;Not shock resistant
1;33.0;4.0;22.0;When I hear PDA, I would like to now envision a device that may look roughly like the Palm V, but has a lot more packed in it. Palm V is an excellent device and it is a great buy for the sake of the technology's first step.\nBut, after using it for about a year now, I am being selfish. I want more memory, I want color, I want sound and I want a floating connection to the rest of the world. So, my advice - when you buy a PDA, go for something with at least color and more memory (for the sake of technology's next step). You are going to run out of the Palm V's 2MB if you are like me and like to download all those available applications. Palm Vx has 8MB memory which should be enough for the time being, but I want more (Sorry !).\nI am looking at the PDA to be the materialisation of Isaac Asimov's vision of a hand held device which is carried by everyone in the world and has a unique identification number. So if you want to talk to your sister, just punch in her id number and there she is on the screen looking at you and yelling at you for buzzing her when she was in the shower !! Our privacy is going to be under fire, but it is going to be fun all the same. Asimov said that by 2010, this will be a reality. And, the world is fast getting there. Palm V is only an initial step !! My advice - go for the next step.;Excellent, but already being pushed to last generation.
18;34.0;3.0;26.0;"I owned a Palm III for a while when it came out, and then stepped up to the V after about a year with my III. What can I say? I was allured by its sexiness and general asthetic appeal.\nI have now relied on it for about a  year for all my organizing needs. I have used every part of the Palm  Software suite except the expense reporting feature.\nWhile I like the  Palm V's style, I have become more and more disappointed by its features  and memory issues.\nFeatures: lacks decent sound for starters, a beep is  boring and weak. When I carry the Palm in its home (my pocket) I cannot  hear the alarm tones even with volume maxed! The screen is a mixed bag.  While its clarity is better than other organizers, it is very hard to read  in slightly dim areas because the backlighting leaves a lot to be desired.  Battery power is okay, but not anywhere near the advertised time of 30  days.\nMemory is a whole different issue. All I have on my palm is some  1500 addresses and 1000 calendar entries and it tells me I am half full, as  you know they advertise a lot more capacity. I don' use but a couple of  aftermarket programs.\nThe Graffiti recognizer is crap. When it works it  puts the wrong letters on the screen. Real users need to get Jot! from  CiC.\nPalm, Inc.'s tech support is the WORST! Most of their support staff  can hardly speak English; so imagine them trying to explain a highly  technical issue! Whats more, they don't even care. I was pormised a return  call - had to call back. I have not once ever received a real response by  email - only autoresponders that say ""24-48 hours"" - still  waiting on my inquiry from January!\nIn short, save a little longer and  get the Cassiopeia E-115 (when it comes out). In my experiences with  head-to-head comparrisons of Cassiopeia E-105s to my Palm V, the Cassio was  a true frontrunner! The E-115 will certainly be even better! If you need a  great datebook and address book to keep you straight and don't need sound,  memory, genuine Word Processing, or Spreadsheet, or color screen then GO  WITH THE PALM V!  But if you need features and real performance, get a  Windows CE Device.";"Efficient Organizer; but low on features and memory"
43;35.0;5.0;26.0;"I have owned the Palm V for over two months, having given up my 30-year Week-at-a-Glance usage.  It took a little getting used to at first, but after 2 months of going paperless, I'm totally hooked.  EVERYTHING goes  into that machine.  It is so intuitive to use that the learning curve was  almost flat.  Some things take a little study, but that's the investment  one needs to make- this is no 4-banger.  At 6.2 ounces with the hard case,  it's not t-o-o bad in the shirt pocket, but is unnoticed in a suit coat  pocket, and fits nicely in a briefcase or glove compartment.  I haven't  submitted it to any abuse such as handling it roughly, dropping it, or  getting it wet, thus no performance problems so far.  Don't forget to order  the O'Reilly publication: ""PalmPilot: The Ultimate Guide (2nd  Edition)""  Lots of good instructions to argment the instructions that  come with the Palm V.";An outstanding example of a good ergonometric interface
59;36.0;4.0;26.0;Let's face it. Flashiness is a good thing. Just being able to whip out one of these anodized beauties is almost worth the money right there ... but the Palm goes further. Not only does it have the same award-winning  interface as the original, it also has a clearer screen, and is much more  portable. I've only given it 4 stars because personally I value memory over  looks, but it comes down to personal preference ... 2 megabytes certainly  is satisfactory for most people's needs.;A Palm geared towards a different kind of user . . .
32;37.0;4.0;24.0;I have been using the Palm V for a couple of months now and I must say that it does indeed serve its functions very well. It is extremely compact in size with reasonably emphasised ergonomics. The Hot Sync works  flawlessly with speed and the character inputs are not difficult to  master.\nHowever, I have noticed that the screen tends to get very blurred  and 'foggy' whenever this product is being used under approx. 2 degrees  Celsius. One would have expected anything like that to happen under only  extreme climatic conditions. The rubberised 'frontal flap' supplied with it  is redundant as it offers zero protection to the overall integrity of the  product, which merely covers the pad area (Good excuse for all Palm V  owners to purchase an alternative cover).\nThis product will stay on  despite the advent of new OS palm-based counterparts w/ alternative memory  expansion, as most (general) users will deem that facility  redundant.\nWith its main unit, flap & (separate) hard casing being  manufactured in Malaysia, India & China respectively, one can deduce  that efficient & cost-effective production has helped contribute to  3Com's global market.;Handy
67;38.0;5.0;26.0;Paml V is my first handheld device. Because of its beautiful design(the size and the weight mean a lot to me), I bought it when it just came out. Regardless all the other Palm models are available on the market, I love my  Palm V, and highly recommend to others. Of course, you should get Palm Vx  for more memory power. I left my four address books, note and appointment  book in my closet. My Palm V goes where ever I go. It is also my alarm  clock now.;almost everything is in your palm

What I do  instead is download them in my old Powerbook 1400c. Nevertheless, it still  is a great gadget! And I never leave home without it!;downside for new macs?

It's perfect for keeping track  of incidental expenses much more easily than fumbling with notes and  remembering things.\nAnother nice feature is that using the HotSynch  connection, the PP easily transfers information back and forth from  computer to the PP itself. This is especially effective when one uses  Outlook, and the PP will even allow you to write and store email which will  automatically be sent later, if you choose.""\nHe loves this thing,  uses it all the time, and it certainly makes him more organized.

46;41.0;3.0;22.0;"Our office has been urging us to use Microsoft Outlook Planner Scheduler to schedule all of our meetings and appointments.  I was originally keeping appointments in the old Franklin Day Planner.  However, there was no way to synchronize the Franklin Planner with the Outlooks scheduler, hence I  missed a lot of meetings.  The Palm V has been an excellent tool to  coordinate this.\nI looked at the Psions, however, they were very big and  cumbersome as compared to the Palm V.  Size does matter(If I wanted a  laptop, I would have gotten one).  The compact size of the Palm V is a  major benefit and the fact that it synchronizes with my PC makes this  great.\nI have several problems with it however.  The first is when the  Palm V is in my pocket, the cover sometimes closes on the buttons on the  front and you hear a clicking sound.  I am sure this kills the battery, let  alone annoying.  I have looked into a hard case, but now you start to get  back into the larger size issue.  The other problem I have had with the  Palm V is that the touch sensitive screen has lost its ""touch"".  It got to the point where I could not even use the Palm V at all. It was  not responsive to any touch of the stylus.  It just locked up.  I  eventually had to reboot and it seemed to have cured the problem, but it is  slower than when I first purchased it and still is erratic in its touch  repsonse.  Has anyone else had this problem?  I have almost gotten to the  point where I have quit using it.  Maybe the Psion will win  out?\nOverall, I think it is a helluva tool, as long as it works!";I've had  problems with the Palm V

7;43.0;3.0;17.0;Over the last years I went from a Nokia Communicator Phone-Pda, to a Nec Mobile Pro 400 Windows CE and ultimately to a Palm V (actually Palm III  with a V upgrade). I must say the Palm isn't my favourite among the above  mentionned PDAs.\nOn the Plus side:\nThe interface is very pleasant to  use, it is small in size and easy to write while standing (unlike keyboard  devices), the hot sync synchronizes seemlessly with your address book,  email etc and there are many software available as well as website where  you can subscribe to channels or download information straight to the  Palm.\nOn the minus side:\nAlthough it is  a nice device to keep diary  and track of your expenses etc., the lack of keyboard means that to enter  any long piece of text is laborious. Consequently, it you are expecting  from your Pda to be able to, say type an email or some notes while on the  road, this is the wrong device. There are many software around but if you  examine it more closely, many are not very powerful. For instance, I was  very pleased to be able to download a map from mapquest, but without the  ability to zoom or search the map it is of limited use.  Palm users are  often excited by the possibility of downloading email from the inbox. With  my previous Nokia communicator, I could download (and send) email from the  internet using my regular ISP (Unlike Palm VII which requires a proprietary  system subscription) so to download emails from my PC only fails to appear  as a very useful to me. I was also irritated by the fact that by default,  it download all emails in the inbox folder of outlook while synchronizing  which I had to delete one by one.  I know it is possible to buy a keyboard  but the keyboard being too large to be carried, I don't see the point of  that.\nConclusion:\nIf you like elegant and simple to use devices (i.e.  if you are a Mac user for instance) the Palm may be for you, especially if  you intend to use it mostly to keep your address book and diary.  If you  seek a PDA also to type notes, use interactive maps and generally expect  more than a electronic diary, I would recommend a Psion, Windows CE or the  wonderful and versatile Nokia Communicator phone.;nice interface but overated device....
44;44.0;5.0;20.0;"I finally upgraded to a Palm V from the Palm Professional, and what a great decision it was.  This lightweight PDA has a better display, and I use it exclusively for all my planning, addresses, to-do list, memos,  email, etc!  Great for a working mom on the go like me.  I love being able  to divide my various activities and lists by personal, business, client,  etc.  And beaming appointments and such to my husband's Palm V is an added  plus, so that we're always ""in sync"".  Hot Syncing always creates  a permanent record similar to a day planner, but without all the paper!  The only negative is the case it comes with, so I ordered the leather case  which is small enough to fit in a purse or pocket.  Hubby uses the hard  case, which fits easily in his suit pocket.

50;45.0;5.0;19.0;"Where to start?  I'll begin by saying..get the Palm V...Everytime I open it up, conversations start about how organized a person I am.  Once you start relating to others about tech features, you're sure to close the  deal.  I don't know if it's the great gasp or the real deal.  I do know  this; I have been able to think less about what my day is like and smile  more knowing I have more free time due to proper planning using the Palm V.  The custom software available online and support you receive from the  company is a great combination.  If you make palm piloting a habit, you'll  sleep better at night knowing you've got everything planned ahead.  Your  only decision left to make after buying the palm organizer is which case to  buy to carry it in.  I chose the Coach leather.  Holds a check book,  business cards, credit cards and cash...enough padding to protect your  investment.

28;46.0;5.0;17.0;I've been using my Palm V for 6 months now and I love it.  I had never used a PDA before and was afraid to make the leap into technology, but I found the Palm V to be very easy to use and intuitive.  Learning Graffiti  was quite easy and I had it down the first day.  I use my Palm everyday for  notes, to do lists, addresses and phone numbers, and a calendar.  I do  email on my PC. Hot syncing was easy, start up was easy, and the battery  lasts at least a week before needing a quick recharge.  I am no where near  using up the 2 mb memeory, although there is lots more I could be doing  with this machine.  Get a case for it, but not one of the 3Com ones.

2;47.0;5.0;13.0;"I am giving this great device 5 stars, because it really works great, got my life organized, and is all-around amazing.  It has plenty of memory for my needs, and the battery lasts forever!  It really beats carrying around a 2-lb organizer (which I never did, so I MISSED appointments, concerts, birthday parties, etc.).  HOWEVER...I really hate how the power button gets pushed when I don't want it to.  When I put it in my purse, I can hear the little button going ""beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep.""  I don't think I should have to resort to sticking little adhesive bits of rubber on my Palm or cutting a hole in my case to prevent this.  For this reason alone I am considering ""downgrading"" to the new Palm m100 which seems to have solved this problem.  Otherwise, I love my Palm V!!!!!";A Great Device!  But,

Back in the states I ran it over with my truck, (it still worked  but had some screen trouble), called customer service and once again I got  a like-new one in 24hrs.  That one broke and because the original was more  than a year old I had to pay $100 for the same great service once again.;great customer service
29;49.0;4.0;15.0;I received the Palm V as a birthday present.  At first I thought that it would take forever to learn how to enter information using the graffiti language but within a couple of hours I had mastered the basic letters and  most of the symbols.  I am not a sale person or one who keeps track of any  business type of information.  I planned to use the schedule and the  expenses the majority of the time.  I found that the handbook for the Palm  V is very user friendly and most quesitons could be answered by use of the  handbook.  The only complaint that I have that you cannot edit the  categories under the expenses type or add any expense type.  It is strickly  aimed at the business persons.  It would be great to be able to add or  delete expense types.  Other than that this is a great tool for any person  and really easy to learn how to use.  The cost is finally coming down to  make it worth buying.  Don't pass this up for any reason.

Really.\nPrior to my Palm V, I had a separate address book and calendar and lists and notes everywhere, all of which ended up getting lost or being in entirely different places when I needed them most. As a result,  I often forgot to do things that needed to be done, lost important phone  numbers, etc.-you get the idea.\nMy Palm V changed everything. Now I keep  everything important, from the standard addresses, to do's, notes, and  appointments to my accounting info, stock portfolio, and local movie times  (thanks to AvantGo.com) all on my Palm V, and it's GREAT!\nA warning to  those buying Palm V's, though. It takes time to get used to it! I hated  grafiti (the ""handwriting"" you must use for the Palm to recognize  your input) at first, and found the miniscule on-screen keyboard a pain.  Additionally, I saw no real point in keeping a to do list and ALL my  appointments on the thing. After a month of forcing myself to do so,  however, I was hooked! After really taking the time to get familiar with  the thing, I use it on the order of twenty times a day--far more than I've  used any other device (digital or old-fashioned pen and paper).\nSo, my  buying advice: buy one! Palm V's are absolutely fantastic, really! They're  beautifully designed (you won't feel geeky pulling one out!) and the  handiest things in the world. I promise!

As doctors, the PDA is the future of fast reference and palmpilot is the gold standard, but which to buy? I have borrowed a Palm V for one  week and I have the opputunity to buy it used for a good price.  I love its  style.  It can't be beat.  However I am conflicted about whether or not I  need the additional memory of the 8 MG of the VX. I can think of 5 more  programs (med dictionary, internal medicine manual, PDR, etc) which I would  like to download, one of which is 4 MGs (Merc manual)alone.  I only have  255 K left.  I am a new user of the V, but I don't want to be impulsive and  by a V when I NEED a Vx for my career.  But technology is changing so fast  and possibly this is good for a student and I will get a new one in a  couple years when the standard will be the dream machine of today for that  same $400 of the Vx.  I have yet to make a decision...price or memory (I am  a poor student).;Going to be a doctor
48;54.0;5.0;12.0;The Palm V has really helped me become organized.  The things I like about it are: 1) It is more of a proactive planner, meaning you can have it set off alarms for appointments.  2) There is a huge software base out there.  Sites have  thousands of software titles for the Palms.  The last thing I've seen  problems with the Palm turning itself on...well there is a software based  fix for that!;Palm V is great

Keep in mind you need to have Quicken 99/2000 on your computer to be able to use it. I did also buy and would recommend buying  the O Reilly Palm Pilot book. The disc is useful for downloading programs  onto it. Instead of having to hunt all over the web they are right on the  disc, all though I had some trouble with getting a lot of them to work or  the links were out of date etc.  Majority of the ones I wanted worked.  Ebook selections are horrible!  I liked downloading Riding the Bullet in a  matter of minutes where it would have taken 20-40 on my computer. I just  wish there were more selections out there.

That's great except for all the glitches.  I've had it lock up so it couldn't be turned off (would only time out).  Now it won't synch at all, even though I've upgraded and reinstalled everything I can imagine, including Outlook.  It's also impossible to mass delete items, you have to open them up one by one.\nSo think hard before you make the leap.  I don't know if there are less glitch-prone handhelds, I just hope so.;The concept is great but execution is poor
20;59.0;4.0;9.0;i've owned several pilots and really enjoy the V for its high portability. while the stock 2meg is anemic, there are a couple of companies that will upgrade the memory to 8meg for around $100 (but beware, doing so will void the Palm warranty) if you find that it is essential to upgrade later on...\nthe screen  is easily the best i've ever seen on a pilot... exceptionally sharp. the  casing is aluminum and lends a solid feel to the V while trimming the  thickness to about half of the IIIx. it's difficult to express how much of  a difference this reduction in size makes until you've had a chance to  carry them around but it's definitely a positive factor for me.\ni didn't  have the deletion problems that plague the previous user although i did  have to reboot the pilot a few times-- although to be fair, i found it to  be the cause of some sharewares i had tried to upload.\ni find the palm OS  to be stable and v3.3 along with the hotsync manager v3.0.4 is truely a  blessing -- among other things this combination allows IR protocol for  hotsyncing my data without the cradle to any laptop equiped with an IR  port.;solid pda
38;60.0;4.0;9.0;PalmV is very easy to use.  I spent only a couple of days to fully utilize the machine.  A lot of add-on programs you can download later on.  It really reminds all my busy schedule.  Very good for anyone who has lots of  meetings. A little downside, once in a while I seem to have problem with  very slow battery charging.;Small but great!
52;61.0;5.0;9.0;I recently purchased the Palm V and was amazed at thesimplicity of the PDA, the ease of operation and the many additionalprograms available for it. The only glitch I found so far is that if you enter a phone number as 8005551212, thats exactly how it will appear.  They should be able to properly display a phone number (as does day-timer).  But, the day-timer software is interactive with Palm V, so the glitch is small.  By the way, lots of other programs like Microsofts Outlook, and others are also interactive with Palm.  Buy it and simplify your life.  Goodbye Franklin.;A must for anyone that needs organization in their life.
68;62.0;5.0;9.0;I had trouble the first week getting the Palm to hotsync to my Thinkpad, and the Palm 5 even crashed once, losing all my data before the hotsync was working.\nSince then this thing has become an essential part of my life.  Works like a charm, both the Palm 5 itself and the hotsync too.  Address  book, calendar, notes...  The Palm is easily the best designed  hardware/software since the Macintosh of the late 1980's.\nBy the way, I  am also using the Franklin/Covey software for personal management and find  this is a nice increment over the built-in daily task list of the Palm.;Tough first week, thereafter an ESSENTIAL tool
11;63.0;5.0;7.0;"My Palm V was wonderful, and I replaced it immediately when it was stolen--Probably the best argument that I really got good value from it!  I had not used any form of portable computer, PDA, or similar device before,  but after just a few months I found mine indispensible.  I chose the Palm V  over the other Palms, and over any Windows-based system because of the  sliim profile. I can put it in the front pocket of my slacks and it is not  obtrusive. The usefulness of the built-in functions for keeping to-do  lists, addresses, and calendars is obvious.  Less obvious is using all the  downloadable software available on the internet--Often for free, but more  often at a modest price, at least for the really useful stuff. I use the  calendar book function in a way I suspect the designers didn't intend--I  enter reminders to myself for a set date and time, so my alarm will go off  and the Palm will display a message such as ""Call Norman now.""  I  also find the Search function very useful.  If I remember that I dealt with  Norman, but have forgotten his phone number or last name, I can have the  Palm search for ""Norman"" and display his name and address  (assuming I entered it when I first talked to him) as well as any notes or  memos I wrote about our discussion. You can do this for any word or name,  so if I remember discussing widgets with a guy, but have forgotten his name  or phone or company, I can search for ""widgets"" and again  everything I've entered on the subject will be available.  In fairness, I  have to say that if you don't have a fairly busy life, you may not have  much use for it, but if your life is a busy one, I predict you will find  the Palm V (or Palm Vx) invaluable. This includes people who aren't  ""high-powered executives.""  Stressed--out students or overwhelmed  homemakers will find it useful.";Invaluable for busy people
16;64.0;4.0;7.0;"For some of you who might be in the same boat as I was in a couple of days ago:\nI used my Palm III to the point where the graffiti pad had slight scratches in it and it would no longer correctly recognize letters in memos, which is primarily what I use it for.  Since the warranty had run  out, I was thinking about upgrading to a Plam V instead of paying the  repair fee. However, someone else lower in this list mentions the  company CIC and a software called Jot.  They offer free sample downloads  and have programs to allow you to write on the whole screen and not just in  the Graffiti area.  Thus, I am able to avoid the area of my screen that no  longer functions as well..the software is a nice  alternative to repairs or unnecessary upgrades.\nI only mention this  because anyone who uses his or her palm enough is bound to run into this  frustrating ""scar tissue"" problem. Tom\nIncidentally, I rate the  Palm V, which I test in stores with four stars since they really should  improve this problem and there is no improvement in Graffiti technology  between the Palm III and the V.";Upgrade?
3;65.0;1.0;6.0;I have been disillusioned with this product for three reasons: 1) After only two months of use, the graffiti writing area on the screen was very scratched and only recognized  my writing about 70% of the time.  Palm would not replace the screen. 2) The green power button on the top of the unit works only about 10% of the time after only 6  months of use. 3) The Compaq Aero comes with 8 times the memory, 10 times more applications and still costs the same!\nConclusion.  Over-priced PDA.  My next PDA will be of the PocketPC persuasion.;Beware poor-quality screen

12;67.0;1.0;6.0;I was never able to HotSync my Palm V even with Tech support assistance.  I bought a wallet case for it, but it still comes on in my pocket.  Yesterday, I took it out of my wallet and noticed it was on, but since then  I have been unable to shut it off.  I've only had it for 2 months and Palm  V will still not refund my money.  There are better organizers out there.  Avoid this product at all costs.;Lousy Product
17;68.0;5.0;6.0;It makes my life so much easier. We only have one life which happens to be split between home and work. With the Palm V  I'm able to keep my children's litle league games and business appointments all at my  fingertips. I never seem to miss important dates anymore. I also have  phone/email numbers & addresses avaialble all the time. I used to use a  daytimmer at work but rarely carried it around at home. The Palm pilot fits  in your pocket is easy to use and keeps my stress level down by not missing  the important events- my families!;What are you waiting for?
22;69.0;1.0;6.0;This was the worst thing I ever bought.  I thought it would help me to get organized, like the name suggests.  But instead, all I found was hours of trouble trying to get this thing set up.  Once I finally got it working, it  said it downloaded my mail, but all it did was succesfully delete a letter  from my Boss!  It included the deadline for a project, that I never  recieved, thus I did not make the deadline and was fired!  I was completely  disorganized for weeks while I tried to get a hold of everything I lost.  I  think that the people who named this combobulation machine an organizer  should read the english dictionary.  An Organizer is one that organizes,  not one the disorganizer, and deletes my e-mail! Apart from that, this  thing would not run any of the games I downloaded from it, and it also kept  losing all of the memos and stuff I put on it.  Maybe if the makers would  have made a more stable OS, I would have been able to recommend this  product.;The Palm V Organizer made me lose my job!
8;70.0;4.0;5.0;This is a great product - it literally runs my life from the time I get up, go to meetings, and go to bed! Excellent hotsync function and tons of user friendly applications on the net.  A couple of drawbacks - runs out of  memory too fast, and the screen scratches pretty quickly too. I bought a  screen saver film to protect.  Cannot even imagine hauling huge day-runner  books anymore!;Runs my life
10;71.0;5.0;5.0;"I bought my Palm last year; after using it for one year, I could never go back.  By the way, I will be just a 16-year old HS Senior.  You might say why does a kid need/want a Palm Pilot?  Well, for one thing, I use it to  write down homework and long-term assignments, and have never missed one.  My Palm has become my palm.  With its date book, I keep, what else, my  dates in order.  The address book keeps all my friends numbers and emails  in order...I haven't missed one yet.  With the memo pad, I can even take  notes in class.  And the plus, its the easiest, most foolproof way to pass  notes in class with my friends who have Palms.  Plus using the numerous  websites I download a lot of programs and games to keep occupied in those  boring classes.  Plus for the gadget-friendly, computer-savvy teen I am,  its the easiest way to stay in touch.  Even my Computer Science teacher has  one... Just a few complaints: 1.  Link with my cell phone 2.  Comes with  more than one metal stylus, the plastic one stinks 3.  Hard Case should  come with it, mine has dents, but I am a kid, and I drop things\nOther  than that, this product is great.  I recommend it to all, Fortune 500 CEO's  and High School kids.  Palm is a great company who makes a great product.";Palm V Rules! The best little invention that organizes life!

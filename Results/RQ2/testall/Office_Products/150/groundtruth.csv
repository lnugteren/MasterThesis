121;1.0;1.0;1523.0;"(NOTE: see my update on NeatWorks ver 5 below)\n\nI have been using NeatReceipts for a couple of years now.  I generally like the product, but I am now using BOTH the 'Classic ver 1.5.9"" and the new Ver 4.0 software because NeatWorks broke a covenant with its' early adopters.  They broke two of the cardinal rules of product development (1) never, ever, under any circumstances forget your early customers and their data and (2) never remove vital features from the product.\n\nFirst, they ""forgot"" their ""Classic ver 1.5.9"" users.  Versions of the software from 2.0 up thru the current ver 4.1 cannot recognize or import any of the receipts or documents scanned into the earlier version.  I have personally talked to them about this for almost 2 years.  At first, in early 2007, they repeatedly stated that they were hard at work on a migration solution.  We depended on that statement, telling them how important it was for us to be able to access our archived data - for inventories, insurance and tax records.\n\nBut they finally just abandoned this effort and offered everyone a discount to upgrade to a later version.  How is that going to help with restoring archived data?  The data and file formats for their .elrec and .eldoc seem fairly simple - a scanned image and some recognized text fields.  Why can't they import those formats like they allow for jpeg and tiff images?\n\nThey offered no acceptable reasons beyond that we are no longer working on that feature and ""would you like to upgrade?"".  They seem oblivious to the frustrations they have caused a large number of their early customers.  We even communicated with Rafi Spero, one of the companies owners.  If he couldn't make it happen, you know they don't care about you as a customer.  BEWARE THIS COMPANY.\n\nSecondly:  The ""Classic"" version allowed users to create folders and subfolders, etc.  This was a fantastic way to organize receipts for cash, various credit cards, checks and debits, by year and then by month.  Or to organize a copy of receipts for an inventory by broad categories and then further by store, year or vendor.  So the initial features of both subfolders and the ability to copy receipts from yearly tax records to inventory folders was extremely useful and helpful in elimnating paperwork clutter.\n\nThe new ver 4 software does not support nested folders or copying receipts to other folders.  Every time you scan a receipt, it goes into a folder.  But all folders are on the same level.  You can show and hide folders, but this is an extremely clumsy process and causes users a lot of extra work in trying to organize their invoices and receipts.  If you want to copy a receipt, you have to scan it AGAIN.  How brain-dead is that?\n\nBottom Line:  This company has proven that, at their convenience, they will ignore or abandon prior versions of the software and remove vital features.\n\nTo fix some of their current short-coming, as mentioned above, it would not surprise me to see them create a new version of their software that is incompatible with what they are selling today.\n\nDO NOT TRUST them with any vital data that you may need in the future.\n\nUPDATE:  2-11-2010 - I have been given a preview of the new NeatWorks ver5 software.  I don't know when it will be released but it seems to have (finally) added back in some of the features that went missing with ver 2 and onward.  Now they also have a chance to allow for importing old receipts ("".elrec"" files) from their ""Classic"" users.  If they do Import "".elrec"" files many Classic users will be happy that their data is no longer ""orphaned"".  I will then change my opinion and rating of NeatWorks and their products because they did admit to these past mistakes, listen and respond to their customers and ""the true test of your character is how you respond to those mistakes.""";Beware - Not Backward Compatible
132;2.0;4.0;715.0;I upgraded from the Neat Receipts 3.0 scanner to the Neat Works 4.0 scanner package recently. I like the Neat Receipts 3.0 scanner, but the upgrade is really worth it.\n\nFor starters the quick scan center with the new version takes less system resources and it allows the user to enter receipts in batches, which is efficient. I was able to scan a pile of 277+ receipts in one night, while watching television. Pretty painless and easy to do without requiring a lot of attention, so you can make good use of downtime while you're watching TV / relaxing, etc.\n\nThe best part of this is not the physical scanner, it's the software. It allows me to look up previous receipts in a jiffy, and lets me shred / toss old receipts. The physical scanner is nice too though. It's definitely not photo quality, but that's not why I bought this package. The scanner works fairly well / quickly for most receipts, a bit better than the silver version even though they're supposedly the same hardware. I find with the older version the USB would fail to be recognized by Windows XP, but no such problems with the new version.\n\nIf you want to organize your receipts and keep good records, I highly recommend this package! It's the one of the few products that actually does what it claims to do. Excellent product.\n\nFuture improvement wishes would be speedier scans, but that is limited by the scanning technology and hardware specifications.\n\nFYI - yes it will sometimes have difficulty scanning very light receipts, but that is to be expected with a scanner like this.  If one expects photo quality scanner this is not the one to buy.  A photo quality scanner will take too long to scan receipts.  This scanner captures receipts information pretty well but it does not produce a photo replica of the receipt.\n\nAlso, the other reviewer mentioned problems with USB. Quite often that is a problem with Windows, especially on a Windows system that's been run for quite sometime and with a lot of other accessories installed.  I installed this on 3 of my windows XP systems and they all worked fine.  If I ever have a problem I would reinstall Windows as Windows tends to get cluttered with hardware profiles and have problems with USB devices.;Good product, does what it claims - to organize your receipts
114;3.0;4.0;542.0;"The ratio of bad reviews to good reviews here on this NeatWorks scanner was dubious so though I desperately needed a receipt-scanning solution, I really hadn't taken the plunge until I visited Costco and must've been riding a wave of positive-ness because I walked in, wasn't looking to buy anything, but when I saw only 2 left of this product on the shelf, I took one.\n\nGot home, inserted the set-up CD as instructed and nothing.  I'm running a new (1yr old) Dell with very sufficient hardware/memory running WinXP.  But I figure sometimes the CD set-up is wonky, so I ejected then reinserted and it worked; brought up the set-up initialization screen.  It asked me to check online for a version newer than what was shipped; I did, and there was.  So after 10 minutes of downloading a 200mb file, I was done.  Clicked the file, set-up was a snap (took 10-12 minutes) and off I went.  Connected the scanner by USB cable and everything worked; no crashing.\n\nTested a batch of 15 receipts to see if it could handle the crinkled, faded, potentially illegible imprints on what seemingly is the standard thermal paper being used by all merchants.  Alas, this product worked fine; and it worked as promised.  Scanned all receipts, and was able to make not only the correct (99% of the time) OCR function for amounts, dates, retailer, and sales tax, it also was able to be relatively correct in judging which sector of retail (general receipt, food, etc.) it should categorize my purchases.\n\nSo the initial test was done; I was pleased.  So now I wanted to dig deep and scan roughly 6 weeks of receipts that I'd amassed -- roughly 200 receipts.  This would've really been a test, since half of these receipts were nearly 4-6 weeks old, they were crinkled from being shoved into my pocket or folio while on the road, and some were teeny-tiny receipts like taxi receipts from Manhattan.\n\nResult?  Got through it all, and except for roughly 5 receipts out of my total 197, the scanner and software were both able to recognize most receipt fields and categorize them correctly.  Oddly, and I think this is because of the clarity of the receipt vs. software, some receipts were ported into the ""Documents"" category vs. ""Receipts"" area.  That was remedied easily by dragging each image from ""Documents"" to ""Receipts.""\n\n""Areas,"" you ask?  The software gives you 3 distinct areas that it will move your raw scans into; those are RECEIPTS, DOCUMENTS, and BUSINESS CARDS.  I'm guessing the software takes ques from the content plus the size of the scan to determine where images should go.  Like I said, the software was mostly correct except for a few faded receipts, but when I moved those stray images from ""Documents"" to ""Receipts,"" the software kicked-in and was able to read the proper field information (amount, etc.) correctly.\n\nFrom these areas, you can then file your raw scans into varying folders that you can create, or into document types if you'd like to export as PDF, etc.  It's pretty simple, and I have never used a product from NeatWorks, so I have no way to compare previous versions with this 4.5.2 version that I'm using.\n\nI looked at negative reviews and can say that I have neither had the software or hardware cause crashes, reboots, stalls, freezes, or any other degradation of my laptop from working as it normally does.\n\nAlso, I had no real OCR problems with the scanner or software recognizing figures or names.  In fact, the only constant problem I had was with drugstore chain ""Longs Drugs"" which uses only a logo and not typewritten version of its name on receipts, so the software took to recognizing the first item in my receipt as the name, so I had numerous prescription receipts filed as ""Hallmark"" since I had bought cards with those purchases.  What amazes me is the software is able to decipher through all the cr*p that's listed on receipts; these days, surveys, serial numbers, and other gobbledy-gook are all listed and yet the software was able to filter through that and report the correct field information.\n\nA couple cautions:  1)  Handwritten numbers have never been recognized in any of my scans, 2) Export data to Quicken in groups based on the accounts you use in Quicken.\n\nAs to #1 above, those who have a lot of written-in totals at restaurants for tip, etc., will find this problematic.  Every receipt I'd gotten for a meal (which were a lot) I had to correct with the tip included vs. the software recognizing only the subtotal before tip.\n\nAnd as to #2 above, I found that importing into Quicken was a snap (as QIF file), but since Quicken will only dump all data in a QIF file into a single account, you need to filter this BEFORE the export.  For example, if you use multiple cards like I do for various clients and you keep track of each account separately in Quicken, then you'd better categorize those purchases in NeatWorks accordingly, and then selectively export those transactions.  That way, your import into Quicken is done per account.  It's easier that way, than having to use the ""Move Transaction"" function in Quicken.\n\nI'd say 4 stars because I had no elements of surprise and no hiccups in service.  I'd rate it 5 stars after about 3-6 months of ownership if this flawless experience keeps up.  I'll be back in September to report.";Loving it during my first 8 hrs of ownership
2;4.0;1.0;103.0;"was using this product for a number of years. overall pleased, up until recently. As time has gone on, the company has decided to stop supporting the desktop application for MAC or WINDOWS and instead push you to use their cloud software solution. You can continue to use the desktop application (legacy software according to them) but there is no support, and on 1 MAC and 2 different PCs, i keep getting a ""Neat Has Stopped Working"" message. The lowest cost option was a yearly subscription that came out to be $80. what a disappointment. the company essentially developed a plan to trap millions of customers. You still have a desktop application (sort of) but you are forced to purchase their monthly subscription program.";It is a Trap.
92;5.0;1.0;318.0;Neat Receipts is a great idea and concept.  But the moment you start to really use it disappointment will set in.\n\nThe portable scanner works fine.  You have to feed the receipt in with a loving delicate touch.  I can live with this.  Here is the problem.  Initially when you do not have much in the library, you can scan and process receipts as fast as you can feed them.  Great.  BUT, once your library starts to build up, it can take up to two minutes for the program to open and I average about one receipt scan per 1.5 minutes.  No kidding.\n\nWhen you read the Neat Receipts' response to the army of pissed off Mac users they simply acknowledge it doesn't work well when you get more than 900 items scanned and it is our responsibility to not have more than 900 items in our library.  Come on Neat Receipts.  Any average consumer or average business person makes more than 900 purchases in a year.  They expect you to split off your library and create a multitude of sessions.  This is a lame diversion from their software engineers fixing the problem.\n\nSo, what is their solution, just like the PC vs. Mac ads where PC spends more money on promoting/advertising the product instead of fixing it in R&D.\n\nMac users, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.  Stay away from this sinkhole of a money pit.\n\nI am now looking at Mariner's Paperless software.  Their features and compatible scanners are listed below.  Most scanners are already compatible with this software.\n\n[...];Neat Receipts for Mac Stinks
1;6.0;1.0;5.0;"This hardware actually requires a subscription to utilize. I have had this hardware for years and have found it to be a great product until my software stopped working and had to reinstall it due to a Windows update. Now, I am left with a device that is downgraded to an older software because Neat in their mind believes that they should charge you to use their product. Yes, you have to install a new software that requires you to pay to use the product you paid for years ago (see photo). The CD installs the old software which is very SLOW to process each scan. The buttons themselves do not work as far as updating the software. Fortunately, I saved the upgrade software (shown in photo) to at least upgrade it to Neat 5. If I did not do that, I would have been stuck with a super SLOW Neat 4. Even at that, I could not install further updates to Neat 5 that I had saved. I am left with a Neat 5 that is a downgrade from the Neat 5 5.7.1.474. There a lot of updates that I have to do without which means a slower and less intuitive program.\nAs far as customer service is concerned, you are out of luck as you must now purchase a subscription to even get any customer support (see photo). All owners are left with an FAQ site that does not even solve the problems met by customers who are now trying to install the old ""legacy"" software. I tried that route only to find that their solutions do not work. And you can see that within their own FAQ site where customers are finding that either the software does not download or does not work properly. In my case, the software installed but did not work. As you can see, they say that you don't have to pay for the device to work but they do not care if the software does not work. If they even read their own site, they will see that there is a major problem with their legacy workaround. There are a lot of alienated and frustrated customers as can be seen just by their FAQ site alone. I cannot believe that Neat would just leave the customers stranded like this. Shame on Neat.\nBecause of this experience I will never purchase any more Neat product as they are not NEAT. They are instead FRUSTRATING and UNCARING when it comes to their customers. Should you choose to purchase their product, be willing to pay to use their new software on a yearly basis or you will be left with a device that is very SLOW to the point of it being useless. I would send everyone a copy of the upgrade in order to help everyone out but I can't. Neat could have simply made this upgrade software to Neat 5 available but they choose not to so that you are forced to purchase their subscription service. They no longer support the old software and do not care to help you if you bought their product years ago and do not play along with their pay-to-play strategy.";Requires Subscription to Use
44;7.0;1.0;102.0;"Long term user of NeatReceipts (then NeatWorks, now just Neat).  Have endured through all the upgrades from Version 1.something, some easy, some not.  Have always found the interface very poor, non-intuitive, restrictive, and just plain painful to use.  Always been a bit nervous about the included corrupted database repair tool.  What is that warning me about?  But N/R could scan directly to PDF when nobody else could, so we have stuck with it.  Have awaited the promised Version 5 upgrade for more than 2 1/2 years.  If you check for updates from Version 4.9.+.+, it declares no updates available.  At the time of this writing, you have to find the upgrade to Version 5 under Downloads on the Neat website yourself.  Then the fun begins.\n\nYou must ""purchase"" the free upgrade for $0.00 through multiple screens/pages.  Then it is off to your e-mail account to wait for the download link.  But, wait, what arrives is not a link; it is just the acknowledgment that you have purchased the free upgrade, and instructions to wait more for a future e-mail that will tell you how to proceed.  Oh, and if it never comes, please e-mail Customer Service.  Eventually the e-mail with the link arrives.  But wait!  Link is not a link direct to a download - link is to screens where first you must type more info into more little boxes on more screens.  Hey! Aren't we here because we are already a registered purchaser of an eligible previous version?  Lots of keyboarding and mouse moving and mouse clicks, and we eventually get to a real download link - a 132MB download. Fortunately, we have truly fast internet, so not too long a wait.  Except!...the download never completes.  The old let's get to 99%, hang there forever, then stop responding trick.  Alright, cancel this download and start again.\n\nOkay, the second download attempt succeeds.  We are now 52 minutes into something that should have taken 1 minute and 52 seconds.  We find the downloaded .exe file and start the actual upgrade.  But the install app first launches a conversion of your previous databases to the ""new"" format.  Yikes! we do have back-ups, don't we?  Oh well, at last begins the actual program install.  Lengthy install with lots of non-movement on the progress scroll bar - includes an un-install of the previous version.  Remember, it is 132MB  before unpacking, so have patience.  Sure hope this works - since our databases have already been ""upgraded"".  No going back now.  It does eventually finish.  Hooray!  We hope.\n\nClick the desktop icon and let's see what's new.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hard drive is running, something is happening.  Like the versions before it, this one seems to need some considerable time to gather itself together before making a screen presence.  Okay, we have been here before; we'll wait.  Ahhh, here's the opening screen now.....well, uhh, no, not actually.  It's a REGISTRATION screen!!??  A registration screen where we must chose the registration key we will use for this installation from a (non-functioning) drop down box that lists only the registration key that we have already typed in twice before.  Plus we are required to 'name' this computer and name its 'location' - okay, let's try 'Bob's Desktop' on 'Bob's Computer'.  That seems to work.  Now we click on the hugely over-sized Registration button and we are done.  Right?  Yeah, no, what?  Nothing. Yeah, nothing.  No Internet activity, no flashing modem lights, no nothing.  Click, click, click, clickity click, click, click.  Yep, nothing!  And this is taking place in a small FIXED size box in the middle of a 24"" widescreen monitor.  You can't re-size the registration box - it is fixed in size and it is too small for its own contents, so you have to scroll up and down and left and right inside the box, and it is apparent there is more to the underlying screen, but you can't get to it.  Great coding, NEAT guys. Is this the new interface you have been trumpeting?\n\nOkay, try to close the little box - can't; dialog box presents itself to scold me for not completing the registration.  Override the objection and close out anyway.  Re-boot the computer. Click on the NEAT icon and wait for the program to open.  But, instead...a REGISTRATION screen!  Now it shows that Bob's Desktop located on Bob's Computer has been registered with the original registration key, but before you can proceed, you must name and place and register this very same computer (Bob's Computer) using the very same registration key from the very same non-functioning drop-down box as before.  And, of course, clicking on the huge Registration button (suspect something is really amiss here!) produces the same nothingness as before.  Are we relishing and reveling in NEAT productivity yet?\n\nRing! Ring! Ring! Hello, NEAT Support?  What? Oh, HAL the NEAT computer is saying their working hours aren't the same as mine.  I should call back when it is convenient for them.  Or stay on the line if I would like to hear them say that again.  Endlessly.\n\nSo, here I sit after 396MB of downloads, two obviously failed installations, multiple registration attempts, growing angst about converted databases I can't access, one dead-end tech support call, and a missed dinner.  It is now dark outside.  I started this ultimately pointless exercise in broad daylight.  I am slowly understanding that NEAT software did indeed take me to a previously unattained level of productivity as promised.  I can't recall such a frustration-filled absolutely zero-productivity day before.  My failed installation aside, NEAT's hugely overly complicated repetitively multi-stepped upgrade process alone should warn you away.\n\nFollow-up:  Finally succeeded in completing an installation on a Win 7 laptop over an existing version 4.7.  Discovered that many of the earlier version's unique and useful features have been dropped.  Forward in complexity; backward in usefulness and features.  Still, I conducted another WIN XP SP3 Desktop installation attempt.  Started with a complete un-install, then attempted a clean installation.  Upgrade refused - said it was already installed!  Did a registry search to remove fragments, then tried again.  Now it says that this is an upgrade and it can't find a previous version installed.  Okay, that's fair and not unexpected.  So I did a full installation of version 4.7 SP8, then attempted another Version 5 upgrade.  As I said, just a repeat of above debacle.  Shampoo, rinse, repeat.  It's time to get out of this shower.\n\nIf you think this is a long review, think of the long hours I spent trying to upgrade.  NEAT tech support had been absent through all of this.  Can we give negative stars? Lots of them?\n\nCompare the large number of negative customer comments for any and all of the NEAT products with the astonishing almost 100 percent positive comments for the Fujitsu ScanSnap.  Wow!  Guess that's where I'm headed now.\n\nSAD SAGA UPDATE Nov 9, 2011 - Received from NEAT Support\n""\nResponse Via Email(Doug) - 11/09/2011 02:31 PM\nHello,\n\nWe have reports from customers with similar feedback and we do apologize for any\ninconvenience this may cause you, but the developers are currently working on an\nupdate to the software as a resolution, which will address the issue; as we do\nsee this is as a high priority.\n""\n\nRemember, this update has been more than two and a half years in the making, longer than the development cycle of most software.

118;8.0;5.0;106.0;I've eliminated mountains of paper from my desk using this product.  After installing the software and calibrating the scanner it took me little time to record and store my documents electronically.  The key is to read over the manual to expose the more useful features of this product such as dragging pages of a multi-page document together to form a single document and how to properly edit a reciept after it has been scanned.  Also make sure that if/when you backup your database that it goes to an external media such as an external hard drive, flash drive, or cd.\n\nReading in an arbitrary document and extracting information from it is a DIFFICULT computer science problem (I'm a CS Grad Student) and this program does a pretty good job of pulling info from what are now commonly cluttered receipts.

8;16.0;1.0;30.0;"NEVER EVER EVER USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!! The software is poorly designed and extremely buggy. It worked (slowly) for a little while then suddenly just stopped. Let me explain the basic setup.\n\nThe way the Neat software is designed is that you have the Neat desktop program that you open and run. You scan receipts into and can edit the information. Then you have to sync it with Neat Cloud which is basically an online mirror of the desktop software. Then, from the Neat Cloud, you can send those receipts to Quickbooks. Now once you send the files to Quickbooks, they are locked on Neat Cloud. You can NEVER edit them or unlock them, not even digging around through menus. It's designed so that you don't have that option! I understand making it difficult for users to accidentally duplicate data that has already been sent but FORBIDDING your users from editing their own data completely?\n\nThis is where the funny part comes in. After having entered a thousand or so documents, it suddenly wouldn't sync with the Neat Cloud. Every time I tried, it would prompt ""Do you want to turn on sync?"" then ask me to sign in. I entered my password and hit save. The box goes away but nothing changes. If I try to sync it just prompts me to sign in again. Well, I still had about 105 documents on the Neat Cloud I hadn't sent to Quickbooks so I thought I would send those over. I selected all but one of the first page (so 99 items) and hit send. Nothing happened, it just sat there with the page dimmed. I refreshed it after about 10 minutes (sometimes the page just sticks and upon refresh the files are sent/locked) and the files weren't locked so it hadn't gone through. I tried it once more, same result. I selected just two files and sent them. 2.5 minutes later I get the ""your files have been sent"" confirmation, finally it worked. I up it to 4 files and try to send it, nothing after 10 minutes. Refresh and they aren't locked. I do a quick check of Quickbooks and low and behold Neat Cloud sent my receipts SEVERAL TIMES! (so much for preventing duplicates) Now I have to comb through 450 receipts looking for 100+ duplicates to manually delete each once.\n\nAnd the desktop still won't sync with Neat Cloud.\n\nI struggled initially setting this up as it is not very intuitive but blamed any issues on there being a learning curve. Now I wish I had never purchased this and wasted so many hours on it.\n\nUPDATE: So the syncing problem was fixed by paying to upgrade to the premium Neat cloud service ($14.99 per month). Glad to know that if I want to continue using this scanner to work with Quickbooks online, I have to pay a monthly fee. The locking problem however has not gone away. It sent 43 items to Quickbooks but did not lock those items on Neat Cloud. Additionally, for negative amounts (credits) it showed those files as ""locked"" as if it accounted for them in Quickbooks. Now I can't send them to Quickbooks, I get an error saying it can't be less than 0. That's good to know because apparently ALL ALONG it locked those files BUT NEVER ACTUALLY SENT THEM and it didn't tell me that.\n\nAt this point I'm not sure whether I want to get my money back or have the satisfaction of smashing this piece of junk with a baseball bat.";Not so neat, avoid at all costs!
135;17.0;4.0;54.0;"This is my first product experience with receipt scanners. I found it very easy to use and intuitive. Works seamlessly with Mac. Although the OCR doesn't pick up everything all the time, it picks up most of it and changing/editing items is a no-brainer. I am very happy with this portable, little scanner. Takes up little to no space; is very compact and also creates PDFs for my text documents.\nThe whole point of getting it for me was to lessen the number of receipt boxes and folders I have running amok in my house. So far, it's worked brilliantly. I scan in my receipts about once a week to keep up with what I have for this year. I love that it doesn't need a power cord and uses a mini usb cord instead. The software allows you to create your own libraries of receipts in order to group them according to your needs.\nI have my own business at home and this seems to be doing the trick. Rather pleased. Gave it 4 stars because it doesn't recognize all the info off the receipts sometimes. Would buy again, knowing what I know now.";Sturdy Workhorse, gets things done!

70;19.0;1.0;36.0;"I've been using Neat Receipts for a while now and have found it to be a decent product. A nice side benefit of their portable scanner was that I could use it without the software for other scanning tasks.\n\nI recently bought another laptop running Win 7 and did a search to find the driver for it. Imagine my chagrin when I couldn't find one. However, chagrin turned to outright anger once I discovered that the reason I couldn't find a new driver is that Neat Co. is charging another $30 for the ""privilege"" of getting a Win 7 compliant driver that will allow me to continue using their scanner with Neat software....or anything else.\n\nSo if you're planning on buying this or any other Neat product, make sure you budget for the cost of buying new drivers whenever Neat Co. needs a boost to their bottom line. Sure there's nothing that requires a company to provide a new driver....well, other than a sense of decency, a lack of outright corporate greed, and perhaps a class action lawsuit.\n\nBy the time one of their reps shows up with a slick response to this review, I'll already have a new scanner and will have started the process of archiving and/or re-scanning all my data as I refuse to give my money to a company that operates this way.\n\nBuh Bye Neat Co.";Don't Expect New Drivers Without Forking Over More $$$

Then I decided to upgrade, BIG MISTAKE, the version 4. X software is not compatible with earlier versions of the software.  They provided a ""Migration Utility"" that will not work without the previous versions database installed.  Guess what, you have to uninstall the previous version to install the migration utility???  All of your old data will either be gone or you need 2 computers, 1 running version 2-3 and the other running Version 4.  You cannot call technical support, you must email them,  the email response is about 3-4 days, and every time I email them their response is to ""try again with the uninstall and reinstall???

81;21.0;4.0;34.0;I purchased the NeatReceipts scanner in order to help me get organized in preparation of my 2011 federal taxes.  Within days of ordering it, I learned the current gov't administration is no longer allowing sales tax to be a federal deduction!  Oh well, I'm still planning to use it to help me get organized.\n\nOverall, I would rate the device a solid 4 out of 5 stars.  It is easy to get started, easy to use, and is helpful when converting paper receipts and other documents into electronic media.\n\nMy two critiques of the device:  1. The feeding process is slower than I would like.  Yes, I could have forked out an additional $200 dollars and got the desk version which is faster, but I did not want the bulk nor could I justify the additional $$.  2. The accuracy of the data captured and summed on the spreadsheet data base is off around 50% of the time (depending on the quality of the receipt being scanned).  Dates are often incorrectly captured, tax and total dollar amounts, and many times, the vendor data is not captured at all.;For Sure Neat Scanner
6;22.0;2.0;15.0;This is great when it works...Unfortunately the software is buggy and Neat doesn't seem to care about supporting their products.  They have already discontinued supporting software for some of these scanners.  About 30% of the time the software will freeze and the program will shutdown, updates have not helped.  It does a halfway decent job of pulling the information from the receipts, but you will still need to go in and manually change many of the entries to correct them.  I've basically given up on using the receipt portion of this product and just use it to scan in PDF's.  This product is not worth the price they are charging.;Not worth the price, poor support
94;23.0;1.0;30.0;I purchased neat receipts for the sole purpose of scanning business cards.  I used to use card scan with a PC years ago and it saved me a lot of time manually entering data.  I thought neat receipts would do the same thing. I considered card scan for mac but could not justify paying almost $100 more.  Well, neat receipts just is not the ticket.  It makes so many mistakes in the OCR process that I spend an equal amount of time correcting them as I would if I just entered the data manually.;Doesn't read business cards accurately
86;24.0;1.0;28.0;I purchased my Neat Receipts for Mac on July 2009.  A few weeks ago it stopped working completely, but it is still under warranty.  The support service of The Neat Company only contacts customers via a message board on their Website, which is slow moving.  When I finally got my replacement scanner it looked used.  I called the sales division after writing several messages that went unanswered.  The sales rep said that they only replace scanners under warranty with refurbished ones, and that it is stated in their warranty disclaimer.  I read it and there was nothing of the sort.  So I requested they send me a new one...still waiting after a week for that...\n\nI DO NOT recommend that you buy this product, the software is also VERY slow.  The other scanner recommended in these reviews is better.;Not so Neat....
134;25.0;2.0;30.0;"I purchased mine at COSTCO, good choice since I'm going to return it as soon as I can.\nThe actual scanner is small and comes with a nice travel case, and a USB cable, that's all you need.\nHere's the issues I've had with this scanner:\nThe USB connections is totally flaky, could be a bad cable, but this is the first time I've had issues with a USB device.\nThe feeding mechanism is bad, it's supposed to grab the paper, but it doesn't work with small receipts, and as it scans it ""bends"" most of the scans.\nIt has drivers (twain and others) you could use with other utilities, but there's no utility to change settings, so you're stuck with basic 200dpi, and b/w, so faded receipts will not scan.\nAlong those lines, the OCR software works OK, but I've had problems with dot matrix printed receipts, they scan as blank pages, and there's nothing that I can do about it.\nThe Quick scan utility stopped showing the previews of scans, it does still count them and load to Neatworks.\nThe software itself seems logically organized, and helpfull, but I found it to be highly frustrating and difficult to customize.  It's designed to make things easy for you, and it uses it's own database to store your scans.  I'm used to saving my scans as PDFs (it does do PDFs) and tiffs, and although it does batch scans, if one receipt will not scan (blank page) you're screwed.  You really have to try to work around the software, which is not easy...\nOverall I just need a portable scanner with a driver utility, that's it.  This thing does more than that, which would be OK, but you're pretty much stuck using it with it's own software, and I don't have the time or interest to learn...";Not pleased at all
107;26.0;3.0;27.0;I have been using this for about a month. It scans in receipts very well and the OCR works about as good as you would expect, maybe a bit better.  The NEAT software is very friendly and easy to set up folders for your receipts. I plugs into your computer (Mac) and powers through the USB.  No power cord to mess with.\n\nI bought this to also make PDF's of documents from time to time and this works well.  The problem with the system is that when you scan a document to a PDF the next time you try to do a receipt, it scans all the black area around the receipt and makes it proportionally small.  To get around this, you have to re-calibrate your scanner before you scan a receipt after creating a PDF doc. This is not a long process, but kind of pain.  If they fixed this it would be a great device.;Works well but not perfect.

Well, the Mac version only goes to 4.1, but I understand there could be a different version scheme for Mac and Windows. No big deal. However, the Mac software is crap. I'm running Yosemite on a 1 year old fully speced out iMac. There's no issue that my hardware isn't up to the task. I tried to install the Neat software off their included CD; it crashed. I downloaded the latest software from their site, ran the installation and it crashed too. I tried again and was able to install the Neat software. Cool. I opened it up and tried to watch the introduction video. It wanted Flash. Ok, not really secure, but what the heck. After installing a new version of Flash, it still wouldn't play. So I found the video on YouTube and watched it there. It's almost entirely a commercial for the product I just bought, so pretty useless. I decided I was going to calibrate the scanner before I started on the pile of documents I wanted to scan. Open the Calibration window? Crash. Great, try again. Did it calibrate? Well, I have no idea if it calibrated or not because it crashed again. Fine, let's try scanning some documents. I did an ok job, but not as sharp as my 2 year old, 80 dollar Epson all-in-one flatbed scanner. I turned all the sharpness setting to max, and still not that great. Whatever, it'll be good enough. Twelve scans in it developed a solid black line about 4 mm in width, running the length of the document that appeared in every scan. I took out the cleaning cloth and tried to run the cleaning program. Crash. So I'm left with a $100 scanner that won't scan, software that's not intuitive (seriously, how do you edit the description field?!) and constantly crashes.

13;31.0;1.0;16.0;This is the first product review I have ever written but I feel the Neat system is such a bad product and people need to be warned about it.  I purchased the Neat scanner in June 2013 as a simple solution to keep receipts.  I am not new to scanning -- I have owned an Epson commercial scanning system for several years.  While Epson is good for large documents, small receipts are cumbersome.  So the Neat system seemed to be a good solution.\n\nThe Neat software began to have trouble sometime around 4 or 5 months of use.  Technical support is nearly non-existent and the technical support staff is not very knowledgeable.  At the end of 2013, or after 6 months worth of scanned receipts, I decided that the prudent thing to do would be to archive the data  and start 2014 fresh.  I followed the Neat instructions to archive the data and the software produced a nice archive file.  Problem solved, so I thought.  Last week, I tried to go into the archive to retrieve a receipt and guess what only about 20 receipts had been archived -- there should have been probably 200 or 300 or so.  OK, I thought I'll get the receipts from the Neat cloud back-up.  And guess what the receipts weren't there either.  After several online chats with Neat technical support (live agents are apparently not available for phone conversations), the online agent concluded that the system had malfunctioned and my data had been lost.  There had been no warnings or anything -- just lost data.  Let's hope I never get audited.\n\nI should add I am quite adept and capable in terms of computer and networking literacy and experience and I own new, high quality computers with up-to-date software which are the core of my small accounting business.  Fortunately my client data has been collected using the Epson system and that system has never malfunctioned in roughly 5 years.  I should have never trusted the Neat system.  Bottom line -- poor software, poor technical support -- do not purchase unless you want to lose your data.  Mine is going into the garbage dumpster.;Do Not Purchase The Neat System -- It Will Lose Your Data -- and There Is Poor Technical Support

He was intrigued with his new gadget and how well it scanned and organized business cards into Outlook and ACT!, and did so without any third party application needed.\n\nWas impressed, but felt that a business card scanner, though handy, was too limiting for my personal needs, so I took a further look that the products from The Neat Company, and the NeatReceipts Mobile Scanner is one of the models that I found. Like my colleague's new tech gadget, I can scan business cards, but with this model I can scan receipts and documents.

This product isn't one that might appeal to all, but if you're looking for a functional and highly versatile computer accessory that's a time-saving device when it comes to dealing with getting loose receipts scanned into Excel, TurboTax, Quicken or QuickBooks, then this is well worth considering.\n\n [Updated 3/2/2014]\n\nMaybe I should have no complaints as this scanner has been in service since 2009, but I have lowered my 'highly recommended' rating of this product to a 3-star recommendation. There have been increasing issues over the last year with the way that this scanner 'pulls' paper, and it has gotten worse. Since this scanner was picked up, it has been used with my Windows 7 notebook and with my Windows 8.1 notebook, and it has become twitchy with both.

113;37.0;1.0;18.0;I purchased the NeatReceipts scanner.  What a fantastic product I thought.  Until I tried to install it on my Vista 32-bit computer.  Impossible, even though it is supposed to be compatible.  Even after talking with the manufacturer, and with MS and Toshiba I had to return it.  Very sad.  And I lost the restocking charge - for no fault of my own!;Vista 32 incompatibility
7;38.0;4.0;9.0;Frankly, Im torn on how to write this review.  On one hand, I have been happy with how this little device has simplified my receipt records and some of the other benefits of the filing system.  On the other, I have found the thing absolutely frustrating with some of the regular issues Ive had with it considering how many years the company has been tweaking the product.\n\nPros\n- Scanner:\no Minimalist design does the job while not taking much space and when it works, it works\n- Software:\no Does a pretty decent job of recognizing and pulling the target data points such as taxes, totals, dates, etc.\no Excel-like spreadsheet makes organizing data a breeze\no Some of the reports you can generate are very useful\no Cuts digging for an hour to find a receipt for that Lowes return to about 2min of sorting\n\nCons\n- Scanner\no Not sure if it is an issue with the scanner or the software but occasionally, it just stops working.  The light is still so it is pulling USB power but the fix is to unplug/replug to get it to function again.\no If the receipt/documents leading edge isn't perfectly even or flat, the scanner has a hard time getting an initial grip\n- Software\no Can be very laggy (plugged into a very high-end laptop so Im sure it isn't the computer).  It will often inhibit scanning the next receipt until the it does what appears to be some initial processing on the last one\no When scanning multiple receipts, it will let you scan additional ones while processing previous (after a few potatoes of waiting between each scan.)  However, Ive caught it where a few of the receipts in the stack I know were scanned simply never show up once everything catches up on the spreadsheet.\no It will make gross errors in reading data.  Ive seen it take $5.99 off a receipt and read it as $5,990.00\no It doesnt seem to learn.  Youd think after scanning the same type of receipt with the same design across the top, it would eventually recognize the business (from what the user manually types in) and populate the store name correctly.  No such luck.\no Occasionally crashes\no Some of the report building steps are not as initiative or as customizable as youd hope\n\nOverall, Id have to say this: we purchased this scanner after conducting significant research and while it seemed like the best option available, it like all its competitors have their flaws.  Furthermore, what you are really paying for is the software.  You can get a scanner (as part of an all-in-one printer) just about anywhere.;Does the job well but has its flaws
139;39.0;5.0;18.0;This is the third different make of scanner I have purchased and for the purpose of records keeping it is the best.  It is fairly accurate in reading and placement of my required data.  Since I have had it 2-weeks, there have been several updates and improvements in the operations that you can choose to do.  I would recommend this to any Mac person who wishes to be able to quickly log and retrieve information from their documents or receipts.;Great Scanner
58;40.0;1.0;15.0;This is the first product I purchased from Neat Receipts. It did not last very long. It started to malfunction after about a year of light use. I cleaned it using the included cleaning paper as instructed regularly, too. I also kept it in its case. This product is so buggy. It tends to crash when you are coverting to PDF files when you scan receipts. What is the point if you cannot convert it to PDF which is supposed to be able to do? I had to often go to task manager and then restart the program in order to continue. It gets very annoying and time-consuming when half the time you have to restart the program just to do a receipt. Then when it is working you have to often correct the totals that it reads. It often invariably adds an extra digit or read the dollar sign as a digit. But the most unforgivable fault of this product is that you have to upgrade the software with a patch just so you can use it with your new operating system such as Windows 7. Rather than trying to fix the problem I decided that I had had enough of it and purchased a scanner from another company and have never looked back. The new product I am using DOES NOT charge to upgrade it to a newer operating system. I hope that this pay-to-update trend does not appear in other products as it is really insidious. You have already paid for the use of the not-so-cheap product. You should not have to cough up some more money when you have to transfer the software to a new system. You don't have to pay for a patch when you install your PC game to a newer system. Why should you have to pay for something that you already paid a lot for?;A Very Buggy Product That Charges You for a Patch in Order to Use With Windows 7 or Vista
131;41.0;1.0;17.0;The scanner can only scan a few items before it is necessary to disconnect and reconnect the USB.  It also makes the whole computer a bit unstable.\n\nEven immediately after calibration, OCR is pretty worthless.\n\nDuring installation, it puts in an entire installation of SQL Server 2005 that is solely for its own use.  Even then, the data is not usable outside of its application.\n\nThe only good thing I can say about this product is that the uninstall utility works properly.  Once removed, my computer works fine again.;Mine is going back -- what a peice of junk
9;42.0;1.0;9.0;Disliked this because it would not feed in a receipt straight.\nThe resulting image quality will of course depend on how well you can get the receipt to feed in as straight as possible.\nI only used this for receipts and it did not seem to work well.\nThank you.;Not well for receipts
80;43.0;5.0;15.0;I haven't had any issues with this product. Actually I purchased it and I worked better than I had expected. This is one of the few options I have seen that allows you to just simply insert the paper, press one button (PDF button) and it asks you where to save the pdf, boom it's scans and saves! If you press the scan button the software opens and you can the option to have the software automatically read and sort the image in the correct folder. VERY NICE!!! IT IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!!;Great Product
119;44.0;1.0;16.0;I bought an older version of this a year ago in the hopes of going paperless. I found the software to be really buggy, crashing a LOT (anytime I tried to scan more than a page). The scanning itself is slow and the automatic recognition feature is so time-consuming and then just plain wrong, it is practically useless. When they finally came out with a Mac version of the software I figured I'd switch it over from my PC to my Mac, and it doesn't crash as much, but I'm now trying to convert the old receipts to Mac as well and it's so painful and time-consuming...keeps crashing when I try to back up the old scans...have to download a new version of the software for the PC so that I can transfer the old scans...My husband bought the new software for his PC laptop and it was crashing his machine so much he gave up and uninstalled it...I've really just had it with this whole situation. I went ahead and bought a Snapscan and am so pleased with how quickly and efficiently that one works. Too bad to have wasted so much money and time on this annoying scanner.;Frustrating
91;45.0;1.0;15.0;I really wanted to love this product. I have been seeing the ads in magazines for a while - the little white machine with orange advertising. I was sold. I finally ordered it one day and followed the instructions. Calibrated and then ran a test scan with a form I needed to scan. All I got was weird spots. Tried to calibrate and trouble shoot.\nBut gave up. I am a Mac user and I am used to being able to troubleshoot things after 2-3 tries.\n\nI emailed customer support and I got no response.\n\nWas really hoping for it to be awesome.\nI have to say I am really sad.\nWorst - I don't even want to bother putting it back in the box and returning it to Amazon.\n\nAm I alone?;Never Worked - Neat did NOT Respond!

26;48.0;1.0;11.0;I purchased this product in April of 2012. I was happy overall with the performance and report options until it forced me to do a software update.\n\nThe software update wiped out all of my data from May 2012 to present. I performed a back up prior to installing the new update and apparently this software is equipped to save the back up in the version of software you are upgrading to. Yes makes no sense but it happened.\n\nTherefore I am left without 6 months of customer receipts, expense receipts and will cost me thousands in taxes. I am sure the IRS won't accept my excuse of the software had a glitch. So thank you for two days and a total of 4 hours on the phone with no offer of assistance what so ever other then doing exactly what I had done 3 times prior. No offer to reimburse for the cost NOTHING.\n\nSTAY AWAY if you value your business! I for one will be starting over.

45;49.0;5.0;12.0;Excellent item!  The reviews seems to be 5 star or 1 star, but look at the dates of the 1-star reviews.  Most of them are from 2008,2009.  In 2008 phones were still used mostly for making phone calls.  Obviously Neat Company have made huge strides in the technology and software since 2008.  I'm an IT consultant and travel almost every week.  Invariably, I will lose one or two receipts by the time I get home.  With this, while on the road, I can add the receipts to my laptop when I get back to hotel, and already have made my money back within a month.  Great that it reads the receipt and fills in most fields(not a 100%, but considering the millions of different type of receipts, what product could?).  Anyway, for the ones it does not pre-fill the information, takes me literally 5-7 seconds to do it.  I thought the $225 price(bought a case) was steep, not a single regret about the price.  Probably what really makes this product work is the software, taxes will be much easier to do next year.\n\nI have two regrets\n1. That I spent $125 about six weeks ago for a VuPoint Magic Wand Portable Scanner\n2. That I haven't purchased the Neat Desktop Scanner(yet);Check Date Purchased When Looking At Reviews
46;50.0;1.0;12.0;The software is constantly crashing.  Contacted their customer support, via submitting a question on their website.  You can't call them.  One tech told me he needed to know when he could remotely access my computer to fix the problem.  I immediately wrote him back to give times and dates.  My schedule was wide open for him.  Instead of remotely accessing my computer, he marked the incident fixed & I never heard from him again.  I submitted another repair incident form on their website to which the immediately marked it as fixed without contacting me at all.\n\nIf I could throw my scanner through the window of their offices I would.\n\nUpdate 12/20/11: Upgraded to their new software (5.0).  Crashed again!  Now they want me to reinstall (4.0).  Their software is crap!  I scan thousands of receipts a month.  It's absurd to think that I need to run save a backup every 10 minutes.  Especially since the backup takes an hour to complete.;Horrible customer service/crashing software
49;51.0;1.0;12.0;"I inserted the CD and got an error that ""The External Program Cannot be Run.""  OK, so i opened Windows Explorer and double-clicked on the setup file.  It started up and I had the option to click a button to get the latest version off the web.  The browser opens and I get another error ""Cannot Process Your Request at this time.""  Great.\n\nWell, I manually navigated the website, downloaded the software and started the installer.  The first thing I get is a warning saying ""The recommended screen resolution to run NeatWorks is 1024 x 768. After installing, please modify your screen resolution to get full screen capabilities of the application.""  Really?  1024 x 768?  Sorry NeatWorks, but I don't have a ten year old monitor.  The most common laptop screens today have horizontal resolutions of 1600 and above and the desktop I was installing on has a resolution of 1920 x 1080.  I'm not about to make all my other programs look enormous just to accommodate NeatWorks.\n\nThe install takes a long time and various windows appear.  Near the end a message box appears that says ""Installing Neat ADF Scanner 2008 Driver"".  2008?  Isn't that three years ago?  I thought I had bought the latest version of this scanner...  Anyway, the rest of the install went fine.  When I started the software, it did say Copyright 2010 so it appears to be only one year old.\n\nOf course, when I started it, again it complained that it wants 1024 x 768 screen resolution, and warned me that my resolution was LOWER than this even though my resolution is 1920 x 1080.  No matter, it doesn't seem to affect anything.\n\nWhen you first run the software it plays a tutorial video which is helpful and not too long. I recommend watching it.\n\nAnyway, I scanned some test receipts and they scanned in fine.  You do have to press the ""Scan"" button on the scanner for EACH scan (it would be nice if it would just keep scanning as you feed in more receipts).  But the big problem was that I couldn't find the image files after the scans were complete.  After some digging around on their website I discovered the horrible news.  There are no image files.\n\nThat's right, this ""scanner"" doesn't save the scanned images as image files on your hard drive. Here I was thinking that's what scanners are supposed to do, but this one doesn't.  It seems this scanner is ""integrated"" with the ""document management system"" (i.e. the software) that comes on the CD. Scans are imported and stored inside a database that's part of this software, but they're not available to you on your hard drive.  I even searched my entire c: drive to see if there was some temporary folder where I could find these images.  Unfortunately, they were nowhere to be found.\n\nMore digging on their website and I found out that the only way to get image files is to select the image in their software program (NeatWorks) and choose ""Save Current Visible Image As"".  Unfortunately, you have to do this ONE-BY-ONE!!!  Yes, there's no way to just export all your scanned receipts as image files.  You can multi-select receipts that haven't been filed yet and export them to PDF, but they get saved as a single giant multi-page PDF file.\n\nSo, if you want a very expensive scanner that stores all of your data in a proprietary database format and is completely useless as a normal scanner, go ahead and drop $180 on this product.  As for me, I'm taking advantage of the Amazon guarantee and returning it.\n\nPS - The software uses an ""activation key"" and only allows you to install it on two computers. This is completely unrealistic for any small business that needs to share the scanner (it's portable after all) among several employees.  If you want to spend $180 and buy a separate scanner for every two computers you have, then this one's for you.";Not Really a Scanner, Useless Without Their Proprietary Software
75;52.0;1.0;13.0;I bought this as the adv release in 2008 and gave up on this product a couple of months ago (April 2010).  I had high hopes and I faithfully defended Neat as a work in progress.  Well there is nothing neat about the Mac version.  It has major flaws.  I only wrote this review after purchasing and using a scan snap and realizing there are quality scanners.\n\nSo on to my complaints:\n-The application as of version 3 is still terribly unstable and I was constantly having to re-index my data.\n-Crashes are common\n-Scanning is slow.\n-Can only scan one side with the mobile scanner\n-The design of the scanner is such that if you have a jam, you are guaranteed to have to run the alcohol cloth thru many times.  Unlike my scansnap which opens up so I don't have to jerk paper thru it.\n-Processing text recognition is slow\n-Auto correction for misalignment is limited\n-The software is set up to lock you into the product.  True you can export the pdf's but it's painful.  I have slowly been doing it for months, as I transition from Neat to just folders in OS X.\n-The scanned files are enormous in size which makes the whole applications data file very large.  Two years of scanning for me left me with like a 3-4 GB data file and most of my scans were in black and white.  My scansnap cranks out a color statement with text recognition equaling about 220 KB  (which is on the large size for the scansnap) while the same file in Neat Works is about 2-3 MB.  It's ridiculous.\n-You can not search the pdf files outside of the application using spotlight, you have to open the program and search inside Neat Works.  In my opinion it's as if the people at Neat built the application to lock users into it.  Sacrificing functionality for the ball and chain.  What Neat Works does is create meta files for the pdf's and image files,  then tucks the real pdf somewhere un-searchable and gives it a 50 character encrypted file name.  I suppose the meta data file has this coded name tied to it.  And if you do find the pdfs there unusable anyway because of the file name (MEOCMEIVI-230480985-QMJENIVJJ-ZLEPFNWIVJ-MDOVJ38VNEI  for example).\n\nNow I own a scansnap S1300 and I couldn't be happier.  The scan snap along with a logical folder system in Mac OS X is the way to go for me.  With the speed, quality and features of the scan snap I can knock out 2 months of statements and receipts in the same amount of time it took to do 2 weeks worth of docs and receipts using Neat Works.  And it's not just to blame the scanner, the application is slow too.;After 2 years of beta I give up on this product

35;54.0;1.0;11.0;"I rarely write reviews, but this unit does not do what it says it does, and I'd like to save another potential buyer from going through what I did. If all you want to do is scan and organize papers, I think that this unit would be FABULOUS once you get it installed and start using it (this is not a quick or easy task). However, IF YOUR GOAL IS TO EXPORT, I would not buy this unit. Since that is my purpose, I'm returning it.\n\nI bought this with the intent of scanning charge receipts from my business and exporting them into Quickbooks. The box and information say that Neat will do this. I hate this task, and I thought the money would be well worth the time savings.\n\nInstallation: The box comes with version 4 of the software. However, version 5 is out, so you are directed to the internet to obtain it as prior problems have supposedly been fixed. Their website is slow, freezes, and often links you to a non-functioning page. After multiple tries, I was able to download the software. It directs you to disable any internet firewalls or anti-virus software. Seems easy, but Firefox didn't have a pull down menu for this. Had to go to help and finally found out how to do this. (The time required for this was my ignorance and not Neat's, however, the same might be true of others as well).\n\nUsual policy to close all other programs during installation of a new program was followed. Finally ready to install, and it freezes and crashes my computer (Windows XP) and my wireless mouse multiple times. I had to endure many restarts of my computer (most had to be without proper shutdown and by using the on/off switch on my computer), and unplugging and plugging the USB connection to the computer for the wireless mouse. Three hours later, it finally installed.\n\nStarting: I'm pretty intuitive and usually start using a program and exploring menus without a problem. However, menus are not intuitive until you read the directions. Again, this is more time invested. Once reading the directions, I have to admit it was no problem using the machine, but it was cumbersome. The first thing is that although the scanning is pretty quick, it takes a while for the software to convert the data into a viewable receipt. Perhaps the best thing is to scan in a bunch of receipts, then go do something else while it works and come back later. I wanted to see if it exported properly before I invested a lot of time scanning. If you do have to go away and do something else while it is processing the scans, it takes away from the time saving purpose of using Neat.\n\nThe next problem is each time you export a receipt, you have to drill down to tell Neat where you want it to export. This involves many clicks from My Computer, All users, shared documents, documents and settings, shared documents, Quickbooks, Company, etc. You can't set any or preferable locations. Then, you have to choose the account from Neat software to the account in QB's each time. Takes a lot of time. Batching the exports is definitely the way to go to make things efficient, but still not as much of a time saver as I thought it would be, especially when you have to keep selecting the accounts in QB's.\n\nPractical use: This is where the Neat fails miserably. I have an account in Quickbooks where all the charge receipts go. They are listed with the vendor, date purchased, and the account that they go into e.g. office supplies, hardware, software, etc. When Neat exports them, it exports them as bills to pay so are under accounts payable and not in the Charge Register under the account that I selected. To get that information, you have to then go to accounts payable. Therefore it is an extra step to go to accounts payable to see the detail to make sure it was correct as well as to look at it for analysis on another occasion. Although that's not the way I record I QB's, I could live with that if it meant that I didn't have to enter all those receipts.  Another problem was that it wouldn't export credit card refunds.  It said it would not import because the amount was under $10!!  It seems absurd not to be able to export credits.  I didn't try to import and charges under $10 so I don't know what it would do there.\n\nHowever, the final thing that killed the deal was that the exported items all come in with the date exported, and not the date of purchase. I tried several different things, checked online forums, help, but there wasn't anything about correcting this. There is no live help; help and customer service are only available by email. I got an email back that says they will get to me when they can. Given that, I went through all the menus, help info, and user forums. My conclusion was that there appears to be no fix for that. If I have to go into each receipt to fix the date, I might as well just enter them.\n\nConclusion: The problems using this to export to Quickbooks make is such that it just doesn't do the job. There are multiple steps to define the program to export to each time, define the account to go to each time, then go to accounts payable to view the details of the export, and then to change the date on the transaction. In addition you have to enter any refunds or credits manually and not through Neat as it won't export them.  This kills the whole idea to create efficiency and save time.";Don't buy if you want to export data to Quickbooks
19;55.0;1.0;9.0;"Using this device, I've eliminated two large file cabinets from my office by storing everything digitally. I scan each document as a pdf and file it according to my own system. You can use NEAT's filing system, but I chose to override it to keep things simple.  Be aware that NEAT has a monopoly on the alcohol-saturated cleaning sheets that you'll need occasionally. With shipping, it'll cost you about $15 for just three of them.  They are not sold in stores.  UPDATE: I have lowered my rating from four stars to one because the unit no longer works properly and NEAT technical support -- after two dozen time-wasting interactions tied to the same case number -- cannot tell me why. The software crashes most of the time these days, which can be very annoying when you've scanned a ten-page document and are hoping not to generate the all-too-frequent message ""NEAT has stopped working...""  Under the circumstances, the problems I cited in my earlier, much more favorable review, are seeming less tolerable.  Read the despairing comments on NEAT's filing software and you'll see that this has been a major issue for the product.  I avoided the problem simply because (as I mentioned above) I scanned everything as a pdf and filed it manually. NEAT took a lot of heat for updating the software in a way that widowed scans done with earlier versions.";I have lowered my rating
74;56.0;1.0;12.0;"First off, I have never experienced such poor tech support as with this product. You cannot get someone by phone, no matter how long the problem has gone on, and the email/web support system is just atrocious. To begin with, the user is forced to choose an issue category that may or may not fit the problem they actually have, and then will get automated responses with suggestions that may or may not have any relevance at all. When I did (eventually) get a non-automated response, the support person had not read my query carefully, and no matter how clearly the problem was stated subsequently provided no useful suggestions. To date there has been no satisfactory resolution of the problem.\n\nThe scanner did work initially, however the OCR is so-so, and the database system is impenetrable. For example, it is very difficult to just get the scanned image alone, without also showing the metadata. And, after getting no help from tech support, I tried doing a clean install of the software, with the result that I now have to re-enter the license key for the software. But, I cannot find the key info, and there is no way to recover the key if you have not registered already with the company. Why, oh why, must one enter a license key for software that is proprietary to a hardware product? What an unnecessary hassle!\n\nIf you are considering purchase, I would strongly suggest you keep shopping. This product looks so cool, and I was ready to be a big fan of it. But it has some serious limitations, and the tech support is absolutely the worst. Really; the worst.";The WORST tech support, for starters...
48;57.0;2.0;11.0;NeatReceipts is a good idea nicely packaged, but the product simply doesn't live up to the sales pitch. The software is limited and buggy, and when something doesn't work, support is -- as others here have complained -- just not there.\n\nEarly in my experience with the product I found that data I had entered was regularly disappearing. I'd close the program, and on re-opening later, it would be evident that scans and hand-entered data had never saved properly or had otherwise been lost in the program's processes. I made an inquiry with Neat's tech support and received a reply inviting me to explain what I'd experienced in more detail. I did that, and then I waited. After more than a week I sent a message asking if any assistance was forthcoming, and then waited again. After about three repeat inquiries over a period of weeks, I gave up. I have never received any further reply.\n\nThe scanner itself is cheap but not useless. But I find that 8.5 x 11 docs have to be re-scanned about 25% of the time, either because the scan came out crooked (no correction of edges can be made once the paper is scanned) or because the program simply doesn't capture the scan.\n\nI would like to be able to give a more positive review.

The biggest issue that started happening is it kept locking up and wouldn't do anything.  It would say that there was an update, but we could never find the update for it.  I mean, we found numerous links to it online, but always got errors and messages telling us that the page or link no longer existed.  Didn't have any luck trying to contact anyone about it either.  He really only got probably a few months out of it before he stopped trying to use it.  Unfortunately he told me about the issue way too late to return it.  :(;My husband wanted this for Christmas to use for all ...

20;60.0;4.0;9.0;"STARDATE: 2/20/2015\n\nIt's been well over one year since I've had any serious problems with NeatDesk, currently using Version 5.5 and having consistent success with it. I'm using the old original local scanner I bought with the system all those years ago, and have not moved to the cloud version. The ancient scanner continues to work well enough for both color and black & white.  The interface is smoother, faster, despite that it still crashes periodically when I ask too much of it.\n\nHad it not been for the crucial records and processes we committed to Neat, I would not be writing this today, and would have not walked but run from this system years ago.  I had no choice but to stick with it. That said, I can honestly not complain about the performance, as Neat has been consistently good over the past year or more, very reliable and operating about as well as one could expect for any piece of software, and a piece of scanner hardware that's been around this long.\n\nNeat...I owe you this. Don't know what happened at your company or how. Over the years you know I complained long, loudly and often. Now that things are going right, it's only fair that I announce it to the world as well.  Booting up Neat is no longer a source of misery and pain. I haven't even thought of tech support for almost two years now. It really is just Neat.\n\nCongratulations. I sure hope it's not just me.\n\nOLD COMMENTS BELOW\n_________________________________________________________\nNEATDESK/NEAT RECEIPTS ABANDONS ONLINE CUSTOMER COMMUNITY\n\nThe update to version 5.2 crashed horribly, and literally attacked my computer.  In my failed attempts to work with tech support, I made a horrifying discovery.\n\nIn what could be called ""execution style,"" Neatco, the makers of NeatDesk and NeatReceipts stunned its user community and its tech support employees by unceremoniously shutting down its online community of users.  The unannounced decision to ""vanish"" the entire user community left NeatDesk and NeatReceipts customers with the ability to communicate strictly with Neatco staff, and no longer with one another.\n\nAnyone in the market for a domain name?  The Neat community domain may also be up for sale to raise cash for the apparently challenged company. Neatco appears to be shopping the ""community.neat.com"" domain name, valued at more than a quarter million dollars by Doowebrank, with a traffic ranking in the hundreds of thousands.\n\n(See:  http://doowebrank.com/www/community.neat.com )\n\nWhat would lead Neatco.com to hack off its entire customer web community like it was a gangrenous limb, without so much as a word of warning to its publics or employees?\nOne guess is the uninterrupted deluge of negative user reviews and comments on its software and application performance.  The NeatDesk/Receipts online community site was no doubt a rich source of information for competitors, who would have needed only to buy and install one Neatco scanner to gain access to the community and the continuous flow of customer frustrations with their system.\n\n""What will we do now,"" asked one customer, ""since the other users often provided solutions that even the Neatco tech reps sometimes couldn't provide?""  We called Neat technical support for a response, but there were no answers forthcoming.  All of the tech reps we spoke to had no idea the online community had been ""vanished"" by Neatco.com management.\n\nCould this be one of the early warning signs of management failure and the demise of Neatco?  Purchase with caution.  This company may not be around much longer.";NEATDESK/NEAT RECEIPTS UPDATE

Oops, it doesn't work with Quicken - maybe it will someday, but meanwhile my receipt pile is just getting bigger.\n\nWhen I first fired it up, the scans were unreadable; rebooted and it worked okay.  It's pretty good at finding data on the receipt, but you still have to double-check that it got the numbers right, and about half the time you have to enter the merchant code or other info.  My receipts get folded into my wallet, so usually they're a bit crumpled to begin with, which doesn't help, and long or torn receipts don't work well either - and it's counter intuitive to put them in upside down (really I'd rather it scanned both sides).  Basically it takes me less time just to hand-enter my data into Q.\n\nNo obvious way to sort by expense type (cash/visa 1/visa 2/bank receipt).  Output as CDF (or TDF, I can't recall) which does not include expense type.\n\nIt is a neat little unit.  They don't emphasize how well it does on photos, and if I were going to keep it I'd try that out, but I assume the resolution isn't good enough, and I'll stick with my flatbed Canoscan for that.\n\nReturning it today.";Not quite there yet

93;63.0;1.0;12.0;I was in desperate need for a scanner to help with my receipts that had piled up for the past 12 months.  I purchased this scanner in the hopes that it would take a mountain and make it a mole hill.  Unfortunately, it turned a mountain into the Himalaya's.  The first 15 scans had 12 of them filed in the wrong colums.  Then, after moving them to the right spot, I had to manually fix 5 of them and fill in the blanks on 7.  I called up tech support and they just told me to continue to recalibrate, that the machine would eventually learn what I was scanning and to be patient with the software as it worked the bugs out.  While this may be the right answer, I expected the machine to come with somesort of pre-built education.  I thought it was my fault but there were no instructions in the box and no details on how to get started.  It is now in a box on its way back to the company as I am better off manually imputting the numbers into a xls spreadsheet.;it turned a mountain into the Himalaya's
57;64.0;1.0;11.0;If you are a business professional, stay as far away from Neat Receipts as possible. As someone who relies on the scanning of documents and receipts for tax purposes I can tell you that this product is terrible. It has a lot of bugs. I have used it on an a high powered computer with XP. This software invariably freezes up often when you convert documents and receipts to PDF. And if you are scanning documents for tax purposes, be prepared for a lot of headaches as you will have to go to task manager and end the program and then start it up again and then locate the last folder where you scanned the file. As if that weren't enough the whole scanning process is very slow when you convert to PDF. And it doesn't end there as you have to correct the database often as it reads the totals wrong very often. It will invariably add an extra digit or read the dollar sign as a digit. Then comes the most unforgivable fault. It charges you to update your software just so that you can use your hardware on a newer operating system such as Windows 7. This is the first company that I have ever encountered that charges just to patch your software to work with the current operating system. It's like Delta and United Airlines charging a hundred and fifty dollars fee just to make a change to your flight. When that happened I just simply ditched them and went with another airline. In that case it was less costly to just purchase another ticket from another airline to go back home. Rather than being a sucker and paying Neat Receipts this extortion fee I decided to purchase a new scanner from another company that DOES NOT CHARGE a fee just to patch the software. I also want to add that Neat Receipts did not respond to my e-mails in regards to the ridiculous price to purchase the software. I will never purchase another Neat Receipts product and hope that you will not make the same mistake that I made.;Very Buggy Sofware and Charges to Update Just to Use on Windows 7
62;65.0;2.0;11.0;I bought the portable scanner with Ver. 4 software, towards year's end so I could get off on the right foot for the new year. The software is functional - not fabulous, but quite workable. I received an error message about a problem that appeared immediately on installation, checked the support material on line, and then emailed customer support . Then the circus came to town.\n\nEvidently, Neatco uses artificial intelligence to respond to inquiries and questions. The results are as hilarious as they are unhelpful. The machinery that responds is extremely literal-minded, and more than a bit superior in tone. I persisted through their clunky, frustrating interface, and after several iterations, I was delighted to hear from someone claiming to be an actual hman being. His advice might have been useful had his suggested course of action been illuminated by even a quick scan of my first emails, the ones sent first to his transistorized colleagues.\n\nIf you buy this product, not something I'm recommending, make sure you install it quickly enough to be able to return the kit if you run into trouble. If you have a problem, you might well find out that you're on your own.;Laughable customer support detracts from a good product
32;66.0;5.0;10.0;After looking for an good scanner I finaly decided to purchase this one. It was the only one that could support Mac & Windows sofeware which comes with the scanner. It works great and does the job very well in black & white as well as color . However if you want to save your documernts on an external drive it will do so but will not put it in order . I had to find this out myself , I did call the company and emailed there Help Desk for advise , but there customer service may as well not be there, they are not helpfull at all. Please do not get me wrong the product is great but the customer service needs to be looked at again, you are better off getting the answers yourself.\nPlease keep in mind that this scanner does pull power from you computer, and thus when using a laptop it will eat up battery power faster, so plug in your computer to AC when using the scanner.;Great scanner
14;67.0;1.0;8.0;This is the absolute worst product.  If you make the mistake of upgrading the software, it does not work and you lose access to all your stored receipts.  Plus, the scanner stops working!  Customer service is not at all available.  I had to go through Time Machine to open up an old version of the product just to get access to my stored data, but then the scanner still will not work as the driver is some how missing.  The program then instructs you to upgrade which caused the problem in the first place.  DO NOT BUY!!!!  You are better off just scanning things into PDF's and creating folders for your own use.  I hate, hate, hate this product and you will too if you don't beware.  Overpriced piece of junk.;DO NOT BUY!!!  ABSOLUTE WORST!  IF YOU UPGRADE, WILL NOT WORK!
112;68.0;5.0;12.0;I've had a Neat Receipts organizer for PC for 4 years and absolutely love it. My dad has a Mac and has wanted to use a program like NR so I was thrilled to find they now make one for Mac. The software loads easily, great tutorials, and works immediately. The product is reliable, easy to use, and a time saver. There is a learning curve b/w the PC and Mac version if you have used the PC version. The document scanner makes emailing documents an option so that a fax machine is not necessary. The money and time it saves on taxes pays for itself the first year. The Mac version has fewer capabilities than the PC version, but that will change ~ Neat Receipts is great about updating the program to expand its functions.;Neat Receipts - the best organizer ever!
66;69.0;1.0;10.0;"NeatCo, perhaps intentionally, has come up with what amounts to the most customer-unfriendly, onerous and mindlessly long technical support every devised.  I think their tech support purposefully hates to hear from their customers, so they went ahead and put the following system together.  First of all, you cannot contact them on the phone.  You call their number and get a telephonic message (in a loop) which repeatedly tells you to return to their website for service.  You go to their website, and you MUST specify from their pulldown list a set of pre-determined items.  If your problem doesn't fit, you're screwed.  You have to put in something completely foreign to what you want just in order for your request to go through.  They then send you, via email, an auto-response telling you to click on a URL to get your trouble-ticket.  Then and only then can you communicate with Tech Support.  Only via the web; no personal contact.  This is what NeatCo calls ""customer support"".\n\nI must say that I did get their Neat Receipts scanner working, but had a minor issue with the ""search"" feature.

Spend a hundred or two more and get a REAL document scanner (I recommend Fujitsu ScanSnap S300M or even better the S1500M).  The speed on Neat Receipts scanner is agonizing slow and the OCR software is even slower and unreliable AND also crashes once in a while in a rock-solid UNIX environment, Mac OS X Leopard.  I cannot believe some of these ratings -- wow, are you kidding me?  I have personally made a bad purchasing decision thanks to you all, wasting my money and time.

30;71.0;4.0;9.0;"I was looking for a scanner that would fulfill my need to get rid of all receipts and documents I had piling up around the house and create a sort of virtual filing cabinet for them.  Neatreceipts for Mac has been able to do this.  Not only does this machine scan any piece of paper you can think of feeding through it but it also allows you to search for whatever information is on the document afterwards.\n\nHow it works:  You scan a receipt and an image is taken in either black & white or color.  Choose which one you want in the settings.  Hit the button on the machine, the scan starts and is done in a matter of seconds.  That's it. Put a receipt in upside down and the software, Neatworks, knows to flip it around to its correct position.  If you have faded receipts that are hard to read, the quality of the image is often enhanced after it is scanned through.  The price paid for an item, the name of the store it was bought at, whether you used cash or credit are all searchable terms.\n\nWhat I don't like about NeatReceipts is how it's necessary to feed each piece of paper into the scanner manually.  Instead of having a machine that just ""knows"" to grab a document and start scanning, I have to press and hold down on the ""scan button"" for every single receipt.  Tedious and annoying if you're attempting to do dozens or even hundreds of documents in a sitting.  Then there are times when the machine inexplicably gives out halfway through a scan forcing the user to pull out the receipt and restart the process all over.  The equivalent of a having a paper jam in a photocopy machine just far less difficult deal with.\n\nOn the issue of Neatworks taking too long to open up as others Amazon users are complaining about -  I've scanned a lot of receipts, close to 600.  When my library is indexed, it takes maybe 5 - 8 seconds to complete.  Then the program starts up.  Not a big deal unless you're really concerned about those extra few seconds.  For those experiencing speed issues, it might be necessary to get the latest software through the Neat website.\n\nI'll admit, I was wary to purchase such an item based on the price tag and reviews here on the site but I'm glad I did.  This is a classic made for Mac type accessory that almost pays for itself in a way.  For anyone looking to get their physical data organized more electronically, Neat has created a filing system that allows users to access information in a manner not really possible until recently.  4 out of 5 stars.";Worth it
84;72.0;1.0;10.0;"I purchased this scanner about three months ago. With the exception of slow performance, I initially did not have any issues. About two weeks ago I installed a software ""upgrade"" to NeatWorks and now my scanner does not work. Since then I have been playing email tag with their tech support staff. They send a ""solution"" -- I try it -- It doesn't work -- I email tech support -- repeat the next evening. I re-installed the original version of the software, and was surprised to find that my receipt database had been converted to a new format and did not work with the old version. Don't waste your time on this product.";Very Poor Mac Support
24;73.0;4.0;8.0;"Smart tip for all users: download the software from Neat's site and install. You're sure to get the latest version that way. When you install, you'll be prompted to sign up for a 30 day trial of NeatCloud, which sounds fine, but once I saw the monthly price I'd be charged, I opted not to go further. This cloud option is really for the extreme neat freaks - those of you who live for organizing and would get a thrill from accessing your receipts anytime, anywhere, including on your mobile devices. I'm not one of those people. There is, of course, something to be said for keeping your receipts safely stored off your computer, but at the price of a deluxe fast food meal every month, it seems a bit costly. That said, using the scanner to take care of my messy habits is all I need, and I can back up Neat's documents to my Time Machine and Dropbox.\n\nIt's as simple as can be - start up Neat's software, feed a receipt into the long slit of the scanner, and press ""scan"". Neat takes care of the rest, including reading as much of the receipt's contents as possible. It was generally able to pick up most clean, clear text, but had trouble on any receipts that printed even the slightest bit blurry. That's easy enough to fix, just click in the box, select the text, and retype the amount.\n\nFrom there, Neat lets you organize the receipts into folders that you can set up for your needs pretty much just like you would in the Finder (as a Mac user - I would assume it's similar for Windows users). There are also Smart Folders, but I haven't quite worked out how they function. The software itself is noticeably scant on details about how these work or how to make custom ones...\n\nOne strange note for Mac users: I can't for the life of me figure out why the Neat software wants/needs access to contacts in my Address Book. Weird. Perhaps I can send my receipts to them...?\n\nWhat's also nice is the unit is tiny and comes with a soft sleeve in which to store it, so it can be neatly stored out of the way. All in all, it's a pretty thoughtful system that I will be putting to much greater use to get much more organized in the future.";A pricey way to get organized, but it does work
50;74.0;1.0;9.0;"While I have never had any problems with the hardware, the software is absolutely unusable.\n1) Poor design:  The developers never really gave a thought to how this software actually might be use.  One cannot quickly switch between the modes for single item and multiple item scanning (it has be selected from a hidden menu) and one cannot set it as a default.  Scanning into a inbox may be appropriate for high speed scanning, but with this type of a scanner just slows everything down.  While processing items out of a inbox, the image is displayed in a fixed size window, forcing one to click several times to find the appropriate size to be able to read it.  Features available in past versions of the software (such as scanning items directly to a folder without going to the inbox first) have been removed and are not available in the current version.\n2) It is slow - processing items out of the inbox takes forever (sometimes over 60 seconds for each receipt), so does updating list of payment types, vendors and other items.\n3) Worst of all it is full of bugs, really annoying, stupid and easily re-creatable bugs, which drive me absolutely crazy.  While processing items out of the inbox, a dreaded message appears that the system is out me physical memory (I tried on several computers, but it works the same on every single one).  This happens every 5 or 6th receipt, one has to close the application, restart, check if the receipt has not been lost and continue.  Sometimes, out of the blue, red crossed out rectangles cover various parts of the display.  Sooner or later the application dies, when restarted, the application needs to re-index the database - a process, which takes about 30 minutes.  The most annoying bug is that the application remembers every one of your typos.  Once you allow an entry with a typo to be entered into the database, the system will resurect it whenever you scan a receipt from the same company, even though you have deleted it from the database.  Once I allowed Home D epot, Safwy and UPper into my database, although I corrected it a million times, on each scan of a Safeway receipt I get a Safwy, Home Depot becomes a Home D epot and Upper Terrace Market becomes UPpper.\nWhy do I continue to use this junk?  I am simply trapped.  I started to use this software with a older, simpler application distributed with my scanner.  Worked like a charm.  Although I had concerns about the proprietary format in which the images are stored, I never had any problems.  Now, that I converted to the ""new, improved"" version, I cannot go back.  The Neat Company has no utility to convert my database back to the old software and I have no other choise than to soldier on and hope that they will fix it one day.  It has been now more that a year and I doubt that they ever will.";Think, before you purchase this product

IF you have been saving tax records using this electronic method (you can now), be aware of my experience:\n1. The software can glitch out and lose records. If you have backups, you can reinstall them, but in my case, the last backup was corrupt because I was not yet aware it was glitching out. Even if you back up frequently (and there is no such thing as incremental, they are full backups), expect to lose data.\nBackups on my blazing fast quad core pc take 40 minutes now. I estimate I have approximately 1200 records in the database, and most do not have all fields filled out.\nThis software is worthless for tax records because you will ALWAYS have to keep the hard copy documents for at least as long as you have to keep your tax records, just in case the software goes toes up or they issue a non-downward compatible version (as they have in the past).\nThe mobile scanner just quit, but after four years of regular use, ok.\nI'll be looking for an alternative now.

51;79.0;4.0;8.0;"I've had this system for almost two years now and have become completely dependent on it. All my receipts get scanned into folders, exported to Quicken, and then shredded. It's made my life SO much easier! But because I use it so much my scanner has become dirty and started leaving streaks on the images. I used the cleaning cloth that came with the system and that helped a little but not completely. Their website says I need to use their alcohol cleaning paper, which did not come with my unit. The only place to buy it is from NeatCo as part of a cleaning package for $9.95. So far so good, that would give me enough supplies for several cleanings. But when you go to check out, they want $13.50 for shipping! This is for something that can fit in a regular envelope and be mailed for 44 cents but because they have a ""contract with UPS"" they can't just mail it. I'm now trying their suggested home remedy of dampening some regular paper with alcohol and scanning it. You have to get it just damp enough so it will go through the scanner intact, not an easy trick and I have already spilled alcohol all over my desk. After six or eight passes it seems to be working but what a hassle! Why can't they just sell the cleaning kit through Amazon or at Office Depot?";Great product until the scanner needs maintenance
101;80.0;1.0;9.0;I had tons of issues with this scanner (application errors, run away scan jobs, etc). Online tech support was decent enough (~24 hr response time) but in the end the scannner was just so slow and the quality was poor (dark and grainy/noise). To address the known artifacts in the document scans (not the receipts) for 4.0 SP2, tech support had me scan in my documents as a receipt until SP3 was available. This did work but it made a mess out of the database. When SP3 was available it did improve the quality of the scan but hardly the quality I would have expected.\n\nThe other thing I didn't like about this product is how the data is stored. This is not necessarily a fault of the product but it was probably the wrong solution for me to begin with. All I needed was an application that would scan the documents into searchable PDF format and accessible/searchable using a simple front end tool. I don't need/want something as complex as an MSSQL solution.\n\nWhen I purchased this scanner, I was on the fence about it so I decided to simultaneously purchase the Fujitsu ScanSnap S300. While the Fujitsu cost more money it is fully warranted for what you get. There is absolutely no comparison between the two. The product (Fujitsu) does a double-sided scan in one pass, it is quick, paper can be in less than perfect shape (rarely jams - and easy to fix if it does) and all data is stored in PDF documents (doesn't require an extra step to export to PDF). There are more features but these are the ones I remember.\n\nTo sum it up: If you are looking for something easy to use, good quality, fast and has a small foot print STAY AWAY from NeatReceipts Mobile w/ 4.0. Instead consider the Fujitsu ScanSnap S300. It costs more money but it is totally worth it.;SLOOOOOW & POOR QUALITY

It was very disappointing considering how much I really wanted to love this product.;Not so feature complete on mac...
109;82.0;3.0;9.0;The scanner is a great size, compact and easy to carry around with my laptop. I really like that it doesn't require any external power too. The quality is great for receipts and documents.\n\nAs for the software, I often find that I have to crop my receipt scans because they show up with a giant black box around them, and generally speaking I have to edit every receipt because the OCR is good but not perfect. The software also seems to be more tailored for business professionals, and not just a regular home user like me. Something like tags or custom fields for each scan would be a great addition to the software. I know you can buy other programs that are supposed to work very well with this scanner, but I feel like if I am going to pay almost $200 for this package, I shouldn't need to buy extra things to make it work.;Scanner is great, software is so-so
110;83.0;3.0;9.0;The Neat Receipts scanner is an awesome tool for scanning. I'm very impressed with the manufacture, form factor, and overall ease of installation.\n\nThat said, be ready for frustration with the software. When it's working, it is the answer to most of my business needs. It handles contacts, receipts, docs, etc...  The image quality is superb, the scan times are quite fast.  The problem is that every time I close the program it crashes, occasionally losing information and always forcing me to reboot my Mac.  This is fine if I was using a PC, but I expect a more robust package for Mac.\n\nAll in all I recommend this product as long as you don't mind the frequent reboots.;Great product but subpar software requires patience.
16;84.0;2.0;6.0;Scanner works very well, software is an absolute nightmare of conflicts (manufacturer admits this), poor protocol, and buggy. If the software is improved to the very basic levels of modern quality standards, this would be a solid product, but until then it's a frustrating experience and potentially harmful to your computer.;Horrible Software Frustrating and Dangerous
61;85.0;3.0;8.0;I am running neatreceipts with the Neatworks V4 software (I'll just call this NW from now on) which I believe is updated to the latest and greatest (SP7) as of Jan 4th 2011.\n\nI am a small business owner and bought Neat Receipts to intergrate with Quickbooks and solve some of my filing issues - particularly gas receipts on thermal paper which fade with time.  So, the scanner I think works great.  It makes it easy to store receipts and is very accurate for common receipts.  But holy cow is the intergration with Quickbooks painful.  NW requires you to do the following EVERY SINGLE TIME you export data to Quickbooks.  You can not save any of this information no matter how frequently you do the operations.\n\n1) Find you quickbooks file on the disk - every time.\n2) Map every catagories you used in your NW receipts to an account in quickbooks.  Again, you can create catagories that map exactly to quickbooks, so theoretically you can ALWAYS assign catagories that align perfectly with quickbooks.  But you can not save the mappings, so you always redo this information.\n3) Map every payment type over to a quickbooks account.  Again, no way to save this even though you'll probably find that every time it's the same (IE, cash receipts should always come from petty cash, Debt cards always come from a checking acct, etc...)\n\nMore frustrating and/or dangerous, is that NW makes no effort to save which receipts have been exported already, so it is all to easy to duplicate exported data which QB will happily accept.\n\nIt would be SO simple in software to solve these issues.  But clearly NW v4 is not really geared towards QB integration which makes it sort of a mildly acceptable but annoying solution to what I was solving.  What is so frustrating is how easy it would be to fix all these problems in software and make it a business-ready solution.;Good product but really annoying integration with Quickbooks
128;86.0;2.0;9.0;The device itself is nice and small and very cool looking. But the quality of the scans is a very low 200 dpi. Which means it is great if you trying to scan receipts and b&w documents. But the quality of, let's say, a photo ad would be bad. This really limits what you can do with this scanner.\n\nI own a Fujitsu ScanSnap S510 that is just plain awesome. I wasn't expecting that from the NeatScan for $150, but I was expecting high resolution scans - maybe just a lot slower. There are much better alternatives out there for a little more money. Check out the Fujitsu Scansnap S300.;Low Quality Scans
72;87.0;1.0;8.0;The upgrades for the software are full of pitfalls, they have very poor suport.  Why would you trust all your documents and receipts to this soft ware when there suport is poor, the software is not upgradeable without a long drawn out afair.\nPass this one up, or you will surely have trouble.\nMichael;Do not buy this!
137;88.0;4.0;9.0;Had this product for about 3 weeks and works like a charm. Very easy to use. Had a little problem installing the product but the installation resolved itself. Too bad the page needs to be scanned upside down - scanned a few blank pages since my other scanner works the other way. Would like to see business card scanning as part of the program with a link to the address app on the mac. Overall, a very good, very solid product.;Simple and effective
11;89.0;2.0;5.0;"We have three of these, and I use them on nearly a daily basis to file almost everything, from receipts to copies of important papers. The database software is easy to use and provides a backup functionality that every user should take advantage of on a regular basis. (I have needed to run restores a few times when my PC died in the middle of a session and the database ended up in an unusable state.)\n\nMy biggest gripe is with the absolutely abysmal customer support provided by this product. One of my scanners has a fault. Each and every time I have reached out to them, I get back the same link to the same web page telling me how to clean the scanner. Even if I mention in the ticket that I ALREADY cleaned the scanner. The warranty for the scanner is not worth the paper it is written on (or the electrons you scanned it into). And many of the so-called ""service plans"" you get from vendors like Staples insist that you exercise the manufacturer warranty first.\n\nI like the product. If Neat EVER resolves my tickets with the broken scanner, I will happily upgrade my review to four stars. But since they don't honor their warranties, they get two.";Really Crappy Customer Support
33;90.0;1.0;7.0;"I have had the portable scanner for several years.  I use it to scan all my receipts for personal use.  I also use quicken.  The original software ""proprietary system of filing"" was OK, but not great.  I was able to use it to handle all of my receipts, 5-10 a day.  The software recognition at that time was not great requiring me to edit all of my receipts, but I learned how to use it.\n\nUpgrading to the 5.0, the software filing system that now comes with the scanner, has been more frustrating than any other software experience.  Other than Quicken's biyearly extortion, this takes the cake.  With Quicken you begrudgingly pay the fee because in the end, the program still works and even with all the problems and the fact that it is not perfect, you always know you can get by with it.\n\nNow the scanner with the new 5.0 software seems to do a much better job of recognizing the information on the receipt and getting it correct.  However, the filing system and program is far from intuitive requiring a significant amount of time reviewing the instructions.  Even then, again, it is not intuitive and also it is cumbersomely slow.\n\nIf you have 100 receipts in a folder, you can count on the program taking over 20 seconds to load.  This means that switching between folders is time consuming and frustrating.  Accidentally clicking a folder with 2-300 receipts will have your blood pressure up and your anger at a maximum as there is nothing you can do until the computer loads the entire folder.  Each folder is loaded as you click on it, again and again, so if you go from one folder to another, you must wait each time.\n\nIt is a great concept, but the software based on my use and based on my readings of what professional software developers have to say on the internet is nearly worthless unless you are only storing a few receipts a month.\n\nI wanted this program to easily search through years of receipts in order for me not to have to go through hundreds of receipts by hand in multiple shoe boxes of receipts.  When I need a receipt for a return, I wanted to search it on the computer and find where it is to make getting the original easier.  Just having the receipts on the computer does not help as most stores will not accept a printed copy of the receipt.  For on line purchaces and warranty, it is useful if transmitting a copy of the receipt will work.  However, I find most still want you to mail the original.  This means you still must have a hard copy in a filing cabinet and an antiquated filing system to parallel this computerized version.  Still the concept and how I used it worked pretty good.  However, the new software makes the supposedly easy time saving task a Herculean effort.  After spending all the money on the product and years of use, I find that a good file cabinet with folders works much better and easier than the new 5.0 upgrade or rather what is currently being sold.\n\nHere is what I want to be able to do with the system.  I want to double click on the icon and have the program boot immediately.  I want to take the receipts from my wallet and scan them quickly into the scanner.  I then want to review my receipts from an un-reviewed folder and migrate them into the proper folders.  This was the way the older program worked.  I want to switch back and forth from folder to folder and have the folder already loaded and available like the old program or Quicken, so I don't have to wait for each folder to load, each time.  I don't want to have to limit my folder sizes because the program takes too long to load a folder with more than 10 receipts.  These are the things I want from a system, but sadly the new 5.0 upgrade and program that is sold with the scanners today does not deliver.\n\nAs a stand alone portable scanner, it has given me years of trouble free use.  So far I really have nothing bad to say about the actual physical tool.  I appreciate the improvements in receipt recognition with the 5.0 upgrade as it is rather good.  However, the program is just not intuitive, it is not easy, and it is frustratingly slow and cumbersome to the point of annoyance.\n\nThe one star rating may not be totally accurate as there are good things to say about this, but in the end the negatives make this nearly unusable as an efficient way to digitally file receipts and I could not in good conscience get someone to invest the time and effort into a new filing system that does not make their filing easier.  You still need hard copies of receipts for just about everything but the IRS.  The old physical filing cabinet and folders worked great for probably over 100 years and being you still need it, I cant say the effort of digitizing the receipts with this system is worth your time and effort the way it currently stands.";Scanner works, however software filing miserable

The ""solution"" is go in to the folder properties for Neat located as follows:\n\n\Program Files\Common Files\NeatReceipts\n\Program Files\Neat\n\Program Data\The Neat Company\nand the desktop shortcut for Neat\nand modify the properties of all folders and subfolders within, or the properties of the shortcut for security so that YOUR OWN SPECIFIC LOGON on this machine [as opposed to already Administrators, etc] has FULL CONTROL.\n\nThe result then is the program works SO LONG AS YOUR MACHINE DOES NOT GO IN TO POWER STANDBY or SLEEP or worse!

116;95.0;3.0;8.0;I had very high hopes for NeatReceipts for Mac, maybe too high. I'm gong to keep it because it does a decent job of its basic task: scanning and analyzing cash register receipts. However, I found the database software to be counter-intuitive, inflexible, and poorly supported.\n\nI suppose if you were just starting out organizing your paper records and using software like Quicken to manage your finances, you might be able to do things in a way that would better integrate with Neatworks.\n\nThe lack of flexibility in Neatworks seriously detracts from the program's usefulness for those of us who have been working on going paperless for a while. To do efficient data entry and export to Quicken, I need to be able to add add and remove fields from forms to match my accounts and categories in Quicken and to be able to clearly see what data is being exported. As it is now, using Neatworks to get data into Quicken is more work than just entering the data from the receipt directly into Quicken.\n\nIn theory, you can add and remove fields, but this feature, as near as I can tell, does not work at all. As a result, the entry forms are cluttered with fields I will never, ever use but I am unable to add fields for items like shipping & handling that I use all the time.\n\nIf you're just looking for easy-to-use hardware and fairly-easy-to-use software that will allow you to archive and dump your paper receipts, NeatReceipts for Mac does the job.\n\nIf you're looking for something that will also streamline your bookkeeping, NeatReceipts for Mac is not there yet. With a little more work on the database side, however, it may get there someday soon.;OK for archiving, not so much for bookkeeping
27;96.0;1.0;6.0;Wow, what an excellent idea. A scanner with software that recognizes and does a pretty good job of categorizing receipts while recognizing which line represent taxes on the purchase, etc. The problem is that, at least on the Neat for Mac version, YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THE SCANNED RECEIPTS AFTERWARD. On the PC version you can then import the data into Quicken or Quickbooks. Not so on the Mac version. There is no way to do it. Message boards on tech sites (and Neat's site) are full of complaints about it.\n\nIf you go to Neat's support website you get weak apologies and no clear answer on what they are doing about this unbelievable oversight. Yet they STILL on their website list Neat for Mac as being able to export to Quicken, etc. That seems shady to me.\n\nSo, there you have it. A bunch of scanned receipts and nothing whatsoever you can do with those receipts afterward in terms of importing the information into an accounting program. You might as well have used your old scanner and some cheap scanning software, because you'll end up with the same thing: a bunch of pictures of your receipts.\n\nDon't let yourself be used by the Neat Company.

28;100.0;1.0;6.0;I have tried NEAT software and hardware, every Neat version since the 2nd version of the software was released.  They get worse with each release.  They are not intuitive or even basically logical.  After I tried Neat 4, I was so disgusted with it, I uninstalled and went back to Neat 3.  Now, I'm trying Neat 5.  Not working.  You can't use the basic search function with a decimal.  Ummmm...Receipts have decimals on them, almost without exception.  But you have to do an advanced search to search for a decimal.  And the search does not recognize any special characters.  Ummmm...why?  How idiotic do you have to be, not to understand that users need to be able to search for ANYTHING - ANYTHING - ANYTHING.  You people at Neat Works just don't think like your customers... at all.  How hard is it to understand that people use your software in a simple, logical way?  You are SO CLOSE to being a wonderful solution...but the ways that you come up short make it worse to use than not to use.  If I can't use Neat 3 on Windows 7, then I am just out of luck.  The latest Neat software is absurdly bad.  If you have more than just a few dozen receipts/documents each month, you may as well keep your filing cabinet.  Because even if you use Neat, it will fail.  You will have a catastrophic failure of hardware and/or software, and you will wish you had physical copies.  But if you are forced to keep physical backup copies, what in the hell is the software/hardware and all the labor of scanning good for?\n\nNeat just needs to go back to the drawing board and redesign, again.

78;102.0;5.0;7.0;I was very skeptical when I got this and bought it through Amazon so I could return it if it didn't work, but in fact it is pretty amazing. I travel a lot and I bring it everywhere, it's small, light, and (to me) incredibly fast. The software works surprisingly well. It can handle other languages pretty well so long as they are in Latin script (otherwise forget it), but even if the data extraction goes awry it's easy to type everything in. Really. I just LOVE this thing. When I got mine Amazon accidentally sent me the wrong model, but NeatWorks sent me a link for the software even before Amazon re-sent me the right product, so my experience with the company was also really good. I seriously tell loads of people about this thing and recommend it constantly. Oh AND--it's super easy to export everything into pdfs. Takes seconds, works great--so I can send things to people easily, and it even combines a bunch of scans into one pdf if you ask it to.

87;106.0;4.0;7.0;I just got my NeatReceipts Mobile Scanner and the night I received it, I was so pleased and happy with it. It was a refurbished model and I got it at a steal for just $69.99. It is so easy to use, useful and makes life so much easier.\n\nI like coming home now with receipts, documents and business cards because the NeatReceipts scanner makes it fun and simple. I think it is amazing that the software program included, NeatWorks can extract the information and detect it from the scanned document and automatically populates the important information from the receipt like Vendor, Category (it guesses), Amount, Sales Tax, Receipt Date and payment type!\n\nIt gives me all of this and lets me even view an image of the file. This is all provided in an easy to read and simplistic format and layout in the program. For business cards, you can get the Name, Job Title, Company Name, Street Address and Email address. Sometimes it is wrong but most times it is usually correct with the information. The scanner speeds through scanning and does it very quickly. You can choose color or black and white, if you want to scan multiple pages and it will do that for you. It can also auto detect which type of document it is (Business Card, receipt, or document). For documents, it will only provide you with a picture - no information. I was able to get rid of a stack of receipts that have piled up and some business cards. I am not even one to shred banking or financial statements but I had many so I decided to scan those in as well. I backed them up using my external hard drive and I was good to go.\n\nAnother good feature is that it can detect blank pages and remove them. You can file any documents into categories other than what type of file it is, you have the opportunity to make your own folders for files to go into within the program. It gives you a nice side by side field run down of all the information.\n\nThe scanner is very compact and even though the case costs much at $19.99, I say since it is made of such hard material that cannot be flexed and includes a space for the mini usb cable as well - it is worth it.\n\nI felt that it was stylish and very sleek, which fits into my office workspace. My only complaint is that when I got a little crazy and scanned over 13 receipts, the program began taking about five minutes to scan and fully process each receipt and then after the processing period was over, it came up with an error message but I did scan too many at much.\n\nThe NeatReceipts is a good value and buy.;Great scanner makes life easy and stress free!

42;110.0;3.0;6.0;I have used the portable scanner for about 2 years.  It scans reliably.  I can scan one document right after another without getting jammed up.\nThe software pulls the document in, evaluates whether it's a receipt, document, or business card.  This works fairly well.  Many larger receipts are judged to be documents but they can easily be dragged and dropped into the receipt column.\n\nThough the process takes a long time, backups are fairly easy to do.  The software is unusable during the time the backups are being made.  The backups can lock up my newer and fairly powerfull PC,  But it's temporary.\n\nThe receipt OCR is fairly good.  It does make a lot of mistakes but I'm sometimes amazed that it's found the right date or total amount.  Then, sometimes, it makes a weird mistake like $-5468 when the total is $45.  I've accepted the fact that I have to make corrections to each receipt.  It also remembers receipt names and, if you've put a name in previously and have to correct another receipt, just putting the first few letters in the name line will bring the entire name up.\n\nWhy they didn't use this same technology for the name line in the document section is a mystery.  I have to enter the full name in most of my documents whether or not I've entered the name in the system before.\n\nThe file organization in this software is also a mystery.  The company touts the software for organizing your receipts and documents and offers lots of training.  However, I have found no training explaining their filing system.  It is simply a puzzle to me.  I assume that the company believes that everyone will simply figure it out on their own.\n\nI have figured it out for myself.  But my system doesn't work well.  The company's instructions are of no help.  The system seems to rely too much on memory of which mine is deteriorating.\n\nWhen I put in a new receipt or document, I have to find a folder to put it in.  The folders can't be nested like all good folders on all other computer programs are.  I click to select the folder and a small screen (what's with these small screens?) comes up showing only the first 6 folders I've created.  I can click to make it full page or I can scroll through the small screen.  So I am presented with a page full of folders and have to search the entire page to find the folder to put the document in.  Well, if I'd organized my folders better, I could find it easier.  So I reorganized my folders - another time consuming exercise.  It's like a huge puzzle and I'm not so good with that kind of puzzle.  I did improve it but still find like minded receipts and documents filed in different places.  And it still takes a long time to file a new receipt or document.\n\nWhen filing a new receipt or document, what's with that tiny review screen?  I can't read a thing on it so need to enlarge the document in the screen.  But the window won't enlarge to full size like most windows do.  I have to click, click, click.... on the plus sign for the document to enlarge.  Then I have to scroll to search for the date or amount.  When I find it, sometimes I realize I need to enlarge it further.  When I click on the plus sign again, the document repositions to the top left corner and I have to start all over in my search.\n\nThis company advertises that they will help me organize my life.  I agree that they do.  But they certainly make me organized in a disorganized way.  Please, Neat, can you focus on making my job of inputting and retrieving data quick and easy?  I know it's not that easy for you to do but, that's the point.  You're supposed to do the hard work so that it's easier for us.  That's what we pay you for.\n\nNow you want me to upgrade to Neat 5.  But I don't know if I can trust you.  I would do it if I could keep my 4 software unmolested so that I can be assured my data is safe.  The horror stories I've been reading don't give me enough confidence in your ability to make my life easier.;Should I upgrade to Neat 5?
97;111.0;4.0;7.0;Like many others, I bought my NeatReceipts at [...] but Amazon has a good price too.\nI had no trouble with installation or calibration and I started scanning receipts right away.\nThe receipts need to be scanned face down. I kept forgetting and had to put a label on top of my scanner to remind me... probably an age issue :-) The scans are quick and clear, even if the receipt is crumpled.\n\nIt is easy to navigate through the software and to categorize receipts. You can scan full page documents, receipts, invoices or business cards. Receipts can be scanned vertically or horizontally as long as they are not longer than the scanner. NeatReceipts will take care of rotating the\n\nI have to admit that I've recently scanned a bunch of receipts and haven't gone back to do the rest of the organizing but it is a comfort to know that I have an electronic copy of all my receipts. I can file the paper copy (or toss it) and not have to go back searching through piles of receipts if I need to retrieve information.\n\nWhat I really wish it would do, and perhaps it will in future software updates, is to separate each item on the receipts for me so that I can highlight certain items and categorize them as personal, tax related, or business expenses. This can be done manually within the software but that means looking at each receipt and calculating the portion that belongs on a certain tax line, business expense category, etc.\n\nThe other thing I would recommend is to get into a routine with your scanner. Scan receipts as they come in and finalize the receipt. Move your scanned receipt to either the circular file cabinet or your receipt file. It is easy to have piles of scanned and not scanned receipts merging together and then you have to double check everything. Perhaps it is just me not being as organized as I should but it is easy to let them pile up.\n\nI also use my scanner for quick page scans - converted to PDF - for emailing one or two page documents. I have a flatbed scanner that is not convenient to do document scanning since you have to lift the cover, position the page, scan, crop, save, etc. NeatReceipts is so much simpler than that and takes care of sizing the document and naming it.\n\nIt has a small footprint so it is easy to keep on your desk at all times. It you travel a lot and need to scan receipts for reimbursement, it is small enough to tuck in a briefcase. Mine came with a travel case to protect it.\n\nI would recommend this product for anyone with a small business or who itemizes your taxes.;Handy Product - Wish it Detailed a Little More
100;112.0;5.0;7.0;After various attempts to tame the mounds of paper that threaten to engulf my office, this package has the best chance. The scanner is a thing of beauty in itself. The software is very, very stable (Readiris take note) very cocoa yummy, mac OSX friendly. There is a capability to produce SEARCHABLE standalone OCR/image pdfs independent OR file within the neat office ecosystem, which is excellently designed, and probably the best way to manage receipts.\n\nIn truth, the OCR is only about as good as anyone else's, so that means that receipt or business card scanning still requires quite a lot of hands on manipulation. That said, its stable (did I mention that?), the data management is elegant, receipt scanning/analysis is still reasonably efficient, and I've been able to pressgang my 12YO into handling it.. in lieu of her running wild with my itunes account.\n\nNeat appear to have a commitment to upgrading the software - my WISHLIST for future development includes:\nEvernote integration (I'm sure they are working this as I write)\nBatch applicable editing (eg Tags, categorization etc\nTonal adjustment of scans (to reduce background noise and cruft)\nTWAIN for third party image photoshoppery (assuming this doesn't exist somewhere already)\nGenerally smarter OCR.\n\nBut all in all, this (after a seriously disappointing experience with IRiScan and Readiris), is the first practical solution I've experienced. Incoming paperwork that might be needed is efficiently scanned, OCR'd, and recycled.. (now coming to an egg carton near you).\n\nNeat is highly recommended.;paperlessness is possible
117;113.0;4.0;7.0;It made filling out some documents for my lawyer so easy.  Scanned and Created PDF doc and then converted to MSWord and MSXcel docs that I could fill in/edit and then save electronically on my computer and print out for my lawyer.  No mess making and correcting errors, etc.  I'm thoroughly enjoying using it to accomplish many different tasks;NeatWorks is Neat
124;114.0;5.0;7.0;If your looking to store your receipts for insurance or tax purposes, look no further. Neat Receipts Model 0346 is your solution. I was amazed at how well this scanner works. I have stored receipts in boxes for years, just in case I ever need them for insurance purposes. I was amazed at how well the scanner works scanning my old receipts. I was afraid that a lot of my older receipts would not scan, because they faded from old age, but I was wrong, only a few receipts did not scan properly.\nGreat Job Neat Co. & Great Price Amazon;Thank You Neat Co. & Amazon
130;115.0;3.0;7.0;Bought fro ANT-Online.  would not accept return, told me to read the small print.  scanner froze after i scanned and shredded about 100 receipts.  lost all info, and my data from the scans.  very disappointing..not to mention costly, and frustrating.  Program worked very well, but froze on my new macbook pro, which runs everything else seamlessly.  The Neat company has quickly sent me another scanner, but ANT-made the process timely, and drawn out, obviously to retain their profits:-(;Great Product, Poor Retailer, Decent manufacturer warranty process
133;116.0;4.0;7.0;I upgraded from the Neat Receipts 3.0 scanner to the Neat Works 4.0 scanner package recently.  I like the Neat Receipts 3.0 scanner, but the upgrade is really worth it.\n\nFor starters the quick scan center with the new version takes less system resources and it allows the user to enter receipts in batches, which is efficient.  I was able to scan a pile of 277+ receipts in one night, while watching television.  Pretty painless and easy to do without requiring a lot of attention, so you can make good use of downtime while you're watching TV / relaxing, etc.\n\nThe best part of this is not the physical scanner, it's the software.  It allows me to look up previous receipts in a jiffy, and lets me shred / toss old receipts.  The physical scanner is nice too though.  It's definitely not photo quality, but that's not why I bought this package.  The scanner works fairly well / quickly for most receipts, a bit better than the silver version even though they're supposedly the same hardware.  I find with the older version the USB would fail to be recognized by Windows XP, but no such problems with the new version.\n\nIf you want to organize your receipts and keep good records, I highly recommend this package!  It's the one of the few products that actually does what it claims to do.  Excellent product.\n\nFuture improvement wishes would be speedier scans, but that is limited by the scanning technology and hardware specifications.;Great for archiving and organizing receipts / business cards
56;117.0;1.0;6.0;"Buyer beware! I read a bunch of reviews before I bought this scanner. It seemed as though the biggest common complaint was Neat's technical support. The fact there were so many reviews about support should have been a red flag. I thought, ""Why would I need support for a simple scanner"". Apparently for the same reason so many others did!\n\nAfter loading the software and plugging the scanner into my computer, I opened the Neatworks software but couldn't scan anything because it said no scanner was connected. I fumbled around their support links and tried their troubleshooting ideas with no success. They have no phone # for support, you have to submit an email. It was two hours before I got a response.\n\nTheir first suggestion was to make sure the power button on the back was on. Seems like a reasonable first suggestion except for the fact that the scanner doesn't have a power button. After trying their other ideas, I replied back that I had no success. The next day I get my next message from them, this time suggesting I try a different power cord. Another great idea except the cord has a unique connection into the scanner. Where am I supposed to get another cord?! Again I followed the other suggestions with no success.\n\nIt has now been 30+ hours since my last reply and I have heard nothing back from them. The scanner is now boxed up ready for return.";Beware!
21;118.0;5.0;5.0;"I had been wanting a scanner that did more than just send receipts to a scanning program.  I needed to be able to sort receipts for 7 different properties.  I was hoping this would be a good and useful product.  I have only been using it for less than a month but so far I have been so impressed.  One of the tips the Neat sent me was to get all the receipts scanned right away.  Even if I couldn't sort the paper receipts right then at least I would have them into the program.  I set up folders for each property.  All I had to do was select a folder, put the receipt into the scanner and click on ""scan"".  It moved the receipt into that folder.  I am learning more of the accounting part of the software but my immediate need was a way to keep the hundreds of receipts I get every year into a safe place and have it organized right away.  I would recommend this scanner to anyone who have a lot of receipts and get frustrated at sticking them in a box or folder at home and then not going through them until the end of the year.  I am very satisfied so far.";Very Pleased
68;119.0;1.0;6.0;It doesn't work as advertised.\n1. When asked, after plugging in, to open my Address Book (Mac), it was surprised that I have few thousands of entrees. OK I can live with that and NOT import my data base, since it said on the screen that it will jeopardize the system.\n2. When I scanned regular business cards, it did NOT recognize the name on the card which was in the middle of the card, bold and obvious. It placed part of the address into First name and last name. Total mess of information. When I contacted support with screen capture samples of what am I getting, their answer was that this is designed only for typical USA business cards, which is totally not true, since the cards I have been scanning where exactly that as well among other cards around the world, that I did just to test it.\n3. Then I scanned receipts and it recognized only one thing. The amount. Everything else was NOT recognized. When I reported that they gave me a list of things that they do not support, from Bank statements (withdrawal) to ....ATM etc. In their advertisement it says that they will recognize the vendor and the vendor was clear bold and in black fonts, totally unrecognized.\n4. Since I hope so much for this to work, I called the sales, since they do not have phone support as they said and then I learned that they DO have support over the phone but it cost $29.95. That was not advertised.\n\nI can go further, but time is all I have.\n\nAlthough a very neat idea, it is not working as of now. I wish them all the best to improve, but drastically or drop the whole concept. We need such gadgets desperately, so I hope that they will succeed.;It doesn't work as advertised
31;120.0;1.0;5.0;It may be that this device does everything it says it does. I'll never know. After an hour of trying to make it work - including a trip to the site (with annoying hard-start audio), three install/uninstall cycles (with a hard reboot each time) - all I got was an Error 500 message. I'm not in the mood to wait for customer service to make it work. Worse, in order to use the device you have to create an account and supply an email address. No thank you. You shouldn't have to endure promotional spam attacks to use a piece of hardware you just paid good money for. Going to try Doxie instead.;A nightmare pain in the ass
98;121.0;1.0;6.0;I don't know where to start.  It has never worked properly.  I received polite interest from Neat Receipts support, until they couldn't fix the issue.  They stopped responding to email after that.  Neat Receipts is buggy, slow (it did give me partial scans, cutting off half the page with all black, and did it s-l-o-w-l-y).  Buy a Fujitsu!  They actually support their product and they get nearly unanimous high marks.  Neat Receipts should go out of business.  Slick marketing, lousy products.;It has never worked
37;122.0;5.0;5.0;This is a great little scanner.  Emphasis on the Little.  It is about the size of the remote to my TV.  That is the first part of what I love about it.  The other bigger Neat Desk scanner is very cool in that it scans 30 Pages Per Minute.  I prefer this little one as, instead of a whole bunch of scanning once a week, it is small enough to keep handy on the desk at all times.  Every time I get a card or receipt I simply scan it the moment I get back to my desk.  The software aspect of the system works great.  I am on a Mac and the integration with Address Book works very well.  If you are just a bit diligent and scan each day this little system can significantly reduce paper clutter as well as keep you very organized.  Just being able to export quick and easy expense reports with scanned images is a great boon.  I highly recommend this whole product suite.;Great little scanner
38;123.0;1.0;5.0;I will be up front, I did not just recently purchase this scanner and software system. I purchased it over a year ago and used V4 of software. Like any software package it wasn't PERFECT and even had a bug or two. But it worked, it worked well and helped me organize expenses, receipts and generate reports the way I needed for my work. Recently they upgraded the software to V5. That release is MULTIPLE STEPS backwards is GUI presentation, usability, software bugs ease of use, etc. My recommendation is DO NOT BUY THIS SCANNER or it's Desktop equivalent if it comes with V5 of the software. Stay with V4, wait until they fix V5 or buy SOMETHING ELSE!;DO NOT BUY THIS IF IT INCLUDES V5 OF SOFTWARE
108;124.0;3.0;6.0;There's two parts to this package: the hardware scanner and the NeatWorks software. To me, the performance of both is mixed.\nThe scanner is great for it's small size and clean scans. Unfortunately, the feed mechanism has trouble with receipts printed on slippery thermal paper (pretty much all receipts these days!). Often it slips on one side resulting in a crooked scan.\nThe filing part of the software is ok. No big faults or bonuses.\nAs others have noted here, the OCR software is hit-and-miss - probably not helped by the crooked scanning.\nRather than being able to go straight from scan to QuickBooks there's a fair amount of manual messing around getting the analysed info correct.\nIt's hard to get more than 3-stars excited about this product. It helps me scan stuff right at my desk but it certainly isn't the productivity boon I hoped it would be.;Mixed performace
47;125.0;3.0;5.0;Having used the software/scanner for nealy four years and was very satisfied, I have found that I cant rely on the product to keep the product key.  For the third time this year, second this month, the program stops working and requires me to re enter the product key.  Not having it available, I upgraded to a newer software..now still having problems.  Now it won't take either product key's.  I downloaded the software, wish I had the disk.;Software
126;126.0;2.0;6.0;This is $50 bucks less than what I paid for it a month ago, and for that I am MAD at amazon.com.\n\nThis scanner does scan reciepts. The software has some cool features, such as a tax organizer with all the schedules and additional information so it guides you where to put things on your tax returns.\n\nBut other than that, it's far too slow to be easily useable. It hangs up, takes well over an hour to close up for me, and uses all my PCs availible memory. It's only getting worse the more reciepts I scan in, so now I'll have to buy a probably overpriced hardrive to store them in? LAME!\nSpecifically it takes too long to process a scan after I scan it, somtimes in cue for a very long time. But even worse, is recatagorizing the reciepts, as this software 'learns' what is a reciept, and has a sorting system for documents and contacts as well (it doesn't always work, somtimes putting stuff all over where it does not belong). But when I try to do this on my machine, it takes several minutes for EACH RECIEPT/SCAN/DOCUMENT. I have thousands of records. There is not enough time in the day to wait for this process.\n\nThe scanner is fine, the hardware part. Yes it scans. Probably scans just as well for $150 as it does for $200, probably even that much better for the satisfaction you would get.\n\nI think you should get it, even though I sort of hate it now. It's the easiest way to deal with reciepts, which is really too bad. It 'sucks' the reciepts in a bit, which works on most newer reciepts, and less for a year or two old, wrinkled reciepts. But a gentle push and they make their way through.\nJust make sure you have nothing else to do on your computer for awhile. And get a cushy mousepad to bang your head on while you wait if you paid too much like I did.\nAnd hopefully they will update the software to make it faster.;MAD

54;129.0;2.0;5.0;I was so excited about Neat Receipts when I got it.  I scanned a bunch of items, and was thrilled to have such a small, portable scanner.  However the scanner broke within 2 weeks of my using it.  It now has black lines through every scan I make.  I've contacted customer support and they are not helpful.  So I ended up returning it.  Other issues:  the report format is not customizeable so, while I was excited to use this for my expense reports for work, the software won't print or export the categories I need for my expense reports.  The OCR capability is mediocre at best so at the end of the day, this just didn't live up to expectations.;Fell below my expectations
59;130.0;2.0;5.0;"When it works, it is great. But, when a receipt won't go through the feeder, the application crashes. Really????\n\nThe interface is also cryptic beyond measure: If I take a month off from using it, I need to relearn the bizarre set of steps it takes to get the data into the right place.  Among other things, it loves to reset to factory defaults, so suddenly an 8.5x11 bill which I've scanned disappears: its gone to live in a separate ""documents"" folder (based on its size, really??) which cannot, by any means that I have found, be moved to become a receipt again.  So I need t rescan it.\n\nThis device is a great idea, and when one is on a roll, it is great for getting a pile of receipts into orderly files. It's ability to find and isolate, for example, the sales tax on a complicated receipt, is amazing. (Try visually finding the sales tax on a Safeway receipt -- its pretty well concealed, but Neatworks always finds it!) Clearly that aspect of their business, gleaning meaning from documents, is Neat's main emphasis.

So I download neatreceipts to my computer go to install it and it requests a registration code, which I no longer have.

For those considering Neat's hardware, look to their upper-end unit.\n\nLater I bought the vastly more efficient Fujitsu ScanSnap S1500M, which is light years ahead of NeatCo's equipment (even their ""higher-end"" NeatDesk model which I've also used at a colleague's.

We had our taxes professionally done for the first time in years because of our new business along with some inheritance we received.  I scanned all our business receipts and it categorized them for me so when it came time to do the taxes, I simply printed out the reports.  I love this little machine and take it with me on each business trip my husband and I go on.  While I am in the hotel room, I scan receipts.  A great way to save and store receipts, a great way tool for tax preparation.  We bought this on a whim at the Atlanta airport where a guy was selling them.  In my opinion, it was a great purchase!;This was a huge timesaver at the tax preparer's office
88;137.0;3.0;5.0;I bought this to organize my personal receipts to my tax records.  I really like the small footprint & it does scan just about anything & it looks really good.  I scanned a Staples receipt & it automatically & correctly recognized the name, amount of purchase & tax & filed it correctly.  I was amazed. It was very very very easy to setup & very simply packaged & instructions are very user-friendly.  I was up and running in 20min.  Now, I did not go into the software extensively, actually I barely played with the software because after scanning the first couple of receipts I knew it was gonna be way TOO SLOW for me.  But, I'm an experienced computer & scanner user.  In my office I have a Brother Laser Jet that scans in bulk & it is super fast.  So, I think I may be spoiled in that sense.  I think the product would be great for someone who doesn't have much experience with scanning & doesn't mind being that it is slow.  I'm returning mine & getting an actual scanner.;Too slow for me, but it does work.
96;138.0;5.0;5.0;The scanner is pretty fast for a small desktop device and produces good scans. The device is portable and connects via usb. The software OCR is pretty accurate. The thing that makes the day is the software. It does a good job of pulling off the fields from the scanned item and placing them into the right place in the built in data base entry. But the thing that really is good is how easy it is to manually update fields or over ride the OCR. Just drag the info into where you want it and edit it for correctness.\nI am using the MAC version but I assume the PC version works just as well.\nSo it does everything I wanted.;A Really useful and easy to use product
103;139.0;5.0;5.0;"I just bought this scanner last night.  Like a previous reviewer, I am also a USAA customer and so needed a scanner to deposit from home.  Initially the USAA webpage did not work with the scanner, but a quick call to USAA solved the problem.  I have been using this scanner non-stop since buying it.  It scans wonderfully and I have all of my documents going into their own folders.  I can't believe I didn't know about this sooner.  As an accountant, I wish all of my clients had this product.  I had to call tech support one time (before calling USAA) and my wait time was minimal.  I've never talked to a tech support department who was that nice...I was blown away.  It is obvious that this company cares about keeping their customers.  I will never, never go back to keeping papers; everything will be scanned from now on.";Everyone Needs One of These!
105;140.0;4.0;5.0;I am impressed with this product. I suggest purchasing a home server as well. I picked up a Maxtor Central Access Wireless Home Server to back up all of my docs to. Perfect combo. I've turned off the analyzing function on the neat receipts, although useful it takes an additonal 1-2 mins for scanning a doc and has a tendancy to pick up the wrong client/company name ultimately making you correct it manually. Even without the analyzing function, it's amazing. No more filing in a cabinet, I file electronically then shred. Get one :);Good buy Neat receipts, good bye papers
120;141.0;1.0;5.0;I havenot yet been able to use this product.  I first had a great deal of trouble loading it and then have not been able to calibrate the scanner.  Customer service has actually been very good.  Apparently this is a problem they have been running into with the platform of Microsoft XP.  They are working to resolve the issue with their programmers, but its been 3 weeks with no resolution.  They have offered to refund my $, which I will take them up on.  My purpose for buying it was for tax preparation and that will soon be past.;This was a total bust!!!!!

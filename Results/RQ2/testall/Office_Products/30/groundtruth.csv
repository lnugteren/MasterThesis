12;1.0;2.0;374.0;I purchased this product in the expectation that it was rather large (per the picture showing a big book resting on it).  Unfortunately it only holds books at a depth of 1.5 inches, which is useless for the programming books, and other textbooks I own.  Also the stand doesn't have a lock, it is instead combined with the page holders on the front to create a rather cumbersome mechanism.  The lack of any real helpful adjustments also made this purchase a regretful one.  If you are going to use books of any real thickness, look elsewhere as I know I just wasted $10.;Not for large books!
0;2.0;1.0;8.0;"This is so bad that I need to write a review so people stop wasting money on this and go for one of the other stands (I have 3 different stands from Amazon). I had two foldable book holders from the Harvard bookstore years ago which were amazing, even for heavy, overpriced physics books with atrociously short shelf lives (I've since found the stands on Amazon- ""Mighty Bright fold-n-stow""). Sadly, they got lost at some point. I bought this Fellowes stand as an add-on from Amazon. BEWARE! This thing simply isn't designed to hold heavy, or even normal books- the foldable prongs are just too close together for this stand to bear any significant weight. I ended up shelling out the money and bought one $10 Mighty Bright, as well as an $15 Actto book holder from Amazon. The Actto takes up a little more space in my bag, but it really is worth it, even better than the Mighty Bright. Well built and as I write this review it's propping open a hefty, 900 page, hardback, 9 x 12 science textbook. I read elsewhere that the Fellowes stand has been around for some 35 years... to my knowledge, books were just as thick/heavy back then, so I don't know how it managed to sell before the age of the tablet (which is all this stand is good for). BOTTOM LINE: This cheap stand is exactly that. If you're looking for a BOOK holder, skip this one and spend a bit more on a stand that's worth it!!!";Spend a few more dollars for a durable, reliable bookstand. Because this is not.
1;3.0;5.0;66.0;Ordered this for my son who does home school. It makes it easier to look at his text books while he's doing his work. It holds large school books 11 x 8 and up to about 2 inches wide. Its sturdy and easy to use. It's very simple and it is small when not in use so it's also easy to store. It was an awesome price and I would recommend it to anyone.;Works very well for school text books
18;4.0;4.0;131.0;This is a very cool product made with just three pieces of stainless steel.\n\nIt folds up into a very small space and holds a small to medium sized book in a near-vertical, open-face position with a certain panache.\n\nBut if you're working from a very thick book, you need a different bookstand. The convenience disappears when you have to be finessing some of the pages of a large book onto the outside of the vertical 'placeholder' and the rest of them on the inside.\n\nI like the idea. 'Shame they don't make a large size, too.;design matters, so does size
14;5.0;5.0;60.0;"I like this. It holds books well. It is holding up well and gets the job done. It is more for books you put would put on a table or desk to read. Not for say taking on a bus to read a paperback. The flipklip is great for doing that. This one is more of a ""I have to type from a textbook onto my computer"" kind of thing. It holds all books but thick volumes like a dictionary. This one is great for holding a cookbook while you are stirring a pot, for learning to type and it holding the book open, for hardbacks that you just don't want to hold with your hands and have it hold it open for you, things like that.";Nice Product!
17;6.0;5.0;53.0;This bookstand is what any student, researcher, or writer needs, but didn't know that they needed.  I had always had trouble with quoting, analyzing, and reading from my books and articles while trying to type up papers.  A bookstand was suggested to me, and lo! has it helped me greatly.  Now I can open a book, or rest a journal article on it, looking at it while I type.\n\nA nice bonus of this stand is that it is double sided.  One side has grips that come up to hold open stiff books.  The other side is more for laying something against it, like a magazine.\n\nA helpful device that you often don't realize you need, you will be grateful at how much assistance this little doohickey gives you!;Ace little tabletop wire bookstand
8;7.0;1.0;30.0;My original purpose for this book stand was to hold open my college textbooks, BUT this stand is not meant for them.  The stand is way to small to begin with and the hooks are not large enough to put a textbook.  After trying all my reference books and textbooks on the stand i realized this book stand was not meant for the student.  Also, the stand itself feels flimsy at best, probably because it couldn't support the weight of my textbooks.  Good thing i bought a larger one even though I wasted my money on this one.;I was mistaken
13;8.0;4.0;18.0;"I couldn't find the dimensions of the little arms that hold the book, but I can tell you that there is less than 1.5 "" of space between the arm and the back.  I have a 4.5 "" text book I wanted to set up, but if I divide the pages into thirds I can get it to work.  It's alright, but not what I really wanted.  The construction is solid, and it's a nice stand, just a pain for thick books.";Nice stand, but my book didn't fit.

9;10.0;5.0;11.0;This small, seemingly fragile, piece of book paraphernalia has been one of the best buys I've ever made.\n  And at one of the best prices: I've never seen it advertised for more than $7.-.  (A quick check shows a price range of $3.15 to $5.69.  {Remember, shipping charges will apply, raising the final cost.})\n  While it's not designed to hold open thick paperbacks (say, something by Stephen King), it does hold open every hard cover and textbook I've insert into it.  (A suggestion:  If one wants to keep open a King-like paperback, try a weighted leather bookmark.  It's my second-favorite piece of book paraphernalia and runs for about $10.-.)\n  Also, I am disabled and am physically unable to hold books open.  This has extended my reach and ability to continue reading.

2;11.0;2.0;6.0;I was very happy with the price of this book stand.\n\nI have been using it with a spiral-bound paperback book.  I end up having to balance a clipboard behind the book to hold the book up so I can read it.  The pages are also very hard to turn.  I have damaged the bottom of my pages by using this book stand.\n\nI am going to purchase the plastic $11 one from fellowes which is also highly rated.  I have that one at school and have been very happy with it.\n\nI do not recommend this book stand for books.  It would probably work well for a tablet computer or Ipad or something.  I will hold onto it in case I buy another product to use it with.;Not for Spiral-Bound Books

I use it primarily to hold hardcover textbooks that are ~1000 pages.\n\nThe product performs as advertised, but it difficult to turn pages once the book is in place. In order to turn the page, you have to remove the book from the stand, turn the page, and then place the book back in the stand.

10;14.0;4.0;8.0;"I have been looking everywhere for a holder for textbooks.  I'm a student and I spend many hours hunched over my textbooks, destroying my back in the process.  This is small, sturdy and perfect for textbooks.  My only problem is that it doesn't accommodate courseware as easily (photocopies of readings bound together) because of the lack of a firm back.  Softcover textbooks are no problem, but anything ""flimsy"" takes a little creativity (ie, putting a clipboard behind it so it stays up).  Since that really isn't the use this product was intended for, I don't fault it at all - and at the price?  Crazy!\n\nJust need to find a way to ship it to Canada...";Great book holder
6;15.0;5.0;6.0;I know, this is supposedly for books, but who uses a book stand?\n\nI got this looking for a cheaper alternative for my Apple iPad, and it works great! The stand folds compact, and fits in my messenger bag perfectly. It holds the iPad sturdier than other stands (many are plastic and wobble), and I was able to use this on the airplane to watch movies on the iPad with no problem. I take it to coffee shops or wherever, and it's turned the iPad into a portable desktop.\n\nThe stand will hold the iPad in both portrait and landscape orientation. The rear stabilizer struts are long, so it would take quite a jolt to knock the iPad off. This was a problem with other stands. I compared this to the sixty dollar metal stand they sell at the Apple Store, and this one was more compact, just as sturdy, and obviously a bazillion times cheaper.\n\nThe only downside (for some) would be that the front pegs, made to hold pages into place, extend up in front of the iPad. This has not been an issue for me. If you sit in a normal height chair and table, looking somewhat downward at the iPad, the pegs do not block the screen at all. If you set it somewhere so that it is at eye level, the pegs extend up enough to obscure a tiny half-centimeter strip. If this bothered me, I'd cut them shorter (the rubber stops come off, so you could do this and then put them back on to fix this issue), but it hasn't been an issue.;Best iPad stand on the market!
5;16.0;5.0;5.0;I love this reading stand. I have always found it difficult to read books on a table, because you have to hold your head at a terrible angle which ruins your posture. I also find holding a book open to read it to be irritating. The final issue I have is when I want to type a quote to a book, or reference a physical book for work I am doing on my computer.\n\nAll three of these issues are for the most part solved by this book stand. It is sturdy (made of metal), well constructed, and yet folds up to be as thick as a pencil and almost flat, so it is very easy to carry (not too heavy either).\n\nThe only thing that can be a bit iffy is that the fingers that hold the book are set--so they can't be adjusted for smaller books. This means that thinner books tend to curl more, making it harder to keep them open using the stand. But the benefit of a larger hook is that you can put something like a Psychology or Calculus textbook on it and it will stand just fine.\n\nI would recommend this for anyone who likes to read at a table, or in conjunction with other things. It would be especially useful for large textbooks on a limited surface.;Simple, yet effective
7;17.0;5.0;5.0;*PROS: You pay for what you get. The stand is well made for people not expecting to mount a 1 1/2 thick opened book on it.\nI'm happy so far, I take it to school, to work, fold it up and throw it in my bag, less than 2cm thick folded flat. Overall I am content with my purchase :)\n* CONS:  This is not suitable for paperback books since the edges fold downward.;Little foldable book stand fits in bag/backpack
15;18.0;4.0;6.0;"This isn't a very attractive item.  It is utilitarian, but it sure does work.  Most of my textbooks that are under 1.5 inches fit into it easily.  Very thick books may require a bit of ""finessing"" as another reviewer stated.\n\nMy only issue with all book stands: page turning.  With this one (and every other I have seen) you have to do too much work turning pages.  These stands work well if you are taking notes on a laptop from a textbook, but not if you are trying to quickly read through something.\n\nStill, I recommend this item much more than other higher priced ones.  I can't imagine it breaking anytime soon - it has held up to the punishment of weeks in my backpack already!";Simple, but it works
11;19.0;1.0;5.0;I just bought this, and have been using it for a regular paperback novel.\nThe coiled wire catches the pages, it's difficult to turn the pages, and there really is nothing to hold the book open without causing the book prop to stand unevenly.\n\nI would recommend a book prop with a plastic back and swivels at the bottom that will adjust with you book.\n\nL.

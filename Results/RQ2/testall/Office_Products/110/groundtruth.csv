93;1.0;5.0;677.0;"After extensive research I had the good fortune of looking for a photo scanner at the same time the Epson Perfection V500 became available. After scanning the first batch of 60 slides, I can heartily recommend this unit. The most significant capability of this unit, especially for the price, is the built-in ICE technology for scratch and dust removal. It is, in a word, astonishing. And, it is saving me many hours of extra work manually doing the same job. There is software-based scratch and dust removal included in the Epson software, but it is ineffective and cannot compare to ICE. I am scanning at 2,400 dpi, more than enough resolution for any practical use other than heavy cropping and enlargement. I use compressed air to ""clean"" the slides before scanning. When scanning with ICE turned off, the amount of dust marks are amazing. Turn ICE on and 98% of the dust is gone. It does take longer to scan with ICE, but the offset is the time saved many times over not having to manually remove the dust post-scan. Photoshop Elements 4.0 is included. I use Elements 6.0.\n\nSo far, the unit has worked flawlessly. Software installed cleanly on first try. Front panel buttons can be reprogrammed for other than the default (e.g., I changed the button for email attachment to launch the OCR to text software included.)\n\nA tip for those who buy this unit for slide and/or film scanning with ICE and scanning 2-4 slides at a time: Click the ""All"" button in the preview window after prescanning (previewing) the multiple slides to select all slides, then click the checkbox for ICE to insure that all slides are processed by ICE. You won't find this in the documentation or on Epson's website. I spent time figuring out why all 4 slides weren't being processed by ICE (I thought the unit was defective at first because only the first slide, which is selected by default, was being processed by ICE), so now you know without spending the time I did. I have used the scanner for photographs and documents, and have converted articles to editable text, all with no problems and excellent results. Still, slides/film is where it shines, thanks to ICE.";A winner for slide scanning
6;2.0;5.0;430.0;I just purchased this scanner - primarily to scan my 1000+ slides. At first, I was a bit reluctant because this model is brand new to the market and I was concerned about those inital bugs. But I know that Epson makes a good product so I took the chance. And am I glad that I did. It has some outstanding features:\n1. Very simple to set-up and then operate. I scanned my first photo within 30 minutes of unwrapping the package. No problems with the software and the on-line User's Manual is really easy to follow.\n2. Very fast scanning. The scan (including preview) of photos is unbelievably fast. But I was really surprised at the speed of scanning slides. A normal scan (without using Digital ICE correction) of 4 slides took less than 5 minutes. Compared to some of the other products, I've been reading about this is lightning speed.\n3. Very quiet. When scanning photos, you can barely hear it. A little more noise when scanning slides, but certainly not bothersome.\n4. Offers 3 modes to choose from - Auto, Home, and Professional. The Auto is the easiest and results in a very good photo. The Home and Professional offer a number of correcting features (more with the Professional mode). I am an intermediate Photoshop user and the Professional mode was as close to using an editing software as I've ever seen. The scan time slows down a bit when you use these correcting tools, but again - no big deal). Once I get the hang of it, I'm sure it will speed up the amount of time I will need with Photoshop.\n5. Digital ICE is fantastic! This feature is used when only scanning film or slides. I first scanned slides without using it. The waulity was very good, but my slides are almost 30 years old so there was enough noise (mostly dust)and fade in them to be noticeable (something I was resigned to fix in Photoshop). I then scanned them using ICE and was amazed! The noise was completely gone and the colors were remarkably restored. The Photoshop work is going to be a piece of cake.\n6. The price is unbelievable for what you get. I've seen scanners costing much, much more that aren't nearly as good as this one.\nIn summary, Epson has come up with a real winner. I really can't find anything negative to say. If you're looking for a quality scanner at a great price, look no further. This is the one!;What a GREAT scanner!!!!!!
7;3.0;5.0;5.0;I absolutely love this scanner! I can not say enough good things about it. After my gran passed we found boxes of photos and negatives of the family. Wanting to keep these I bought this scanner- and I am so happy I did. The interface is so easy my mom can use it (it can be point and click if you want it to be), but it has the technical functions that let you really play with images. It renders negatives, repairs damaged photos (tears and wrinkles, etc.) and can even adjust the color balance of old photos (for getting rid of that weird yellow tint on all the photos from the 60-70s). I think the only con is that I wish it had more customization features.  But for me- this was the closest I could get to professional equipment without the professional price tag.;I absolutely love this scanner
5;4.0;2.0;251.0;Installing the V500 is a snap, and the scans it generates are excellent. So why am I returning it after just a day? It's too slow by a longshot, for me at least. You might have better luck or more patience.\n\nPlain scans (no dust removal, no ICE) of 35mm negatives (24-bit color, 3200dpi) took 15 minutes each, not 2-3 minutes, like many people report from similar scanners.\n\nThe V500 scans paper or photos faster, but still not as fast, and with no better results, than my 1999-vintage HP6100C, including warm-up time for the HP lamp.\n\nFrom reports on the web, it looks like other Epson scanners have similar problems - they work well for some users but are horribly slow for others. I'm apparently one of the others. Because I didn't find any happy endings for the unlucky owners, I'm not tempted to spend more time troubleshooting. My scanner is going back.\n\nHere are some more details: a preview alone of film took anywhere from 30 seconds to more than 2 minutes. During that time, like during a full scan, Windows Task Manager shows the Epson Scan program using 99% of the CPU and loads of I/O, but not too much memory (over 2GB of RAM remained available).\n\nThere could a fix, but I checked for software and driver updates, and all the Epson support site suggested was that I scan with lower resolution. The computer has good specs: XPSP2 Pro, 3GHz Pentium 4 (HT disabled), 3GB RAM, unfragmented SATA drive with lots of space, 256MB GeForce 6800 video, and nothing else on the USB 2.0 hub with the scanner. Epson technical support is only open during regular business hours M-F.;Slow. Really Slow.
1;5.0;4.0;219.0;Initially I was disappointed in this scanner.  I was getting artifacts in my scans: posterizing, strange banding (like an old dot matrix scanner) and scans above 2400dpi didn't seem to have any additional detail.  For a while I was convinced the optical resolution was 2400 instead of the advertised 6400.\n\nEventually I discovered that the Epson software sucks.  I would recommend only using the Color Restoration (which seems to be first rate oddly) and Digital Ice options.  Everything else seemed to ruin the photos upon close inspection.  You will need to make any adjustments in photo shop.\n\nIn addition to this, the software is difficult to use.  It has an option to save your scanning settings -- but it doesn't work (on OSX at least).  I have to set the  option manually for every scan.  When you preview your scan, sometimes it only selects one photo when you mean to change the settings for them all.  Between these two problems, I find myself scanning photos with the wrong settings on a regular basis.  As a SW Engineer myself -- this is inexcusable.\n\nSome people have complained the scanner is slow -- it is -- but if you compare specs it seemed to be in line with other scanners of this price.\n\nDespite these problems I give the scanner 4 stars.  I own a Canon scanner and the software is *far* worse *and* the image quality sucks, so Epson wins by default: Marginal Software and excellent image quality seem to be a winning combination.;Great scanner, *HORRIBLE* software
70;6.0;4.0;103.0;"I primarily picked up this scanner because I want to digitize my photos via their negatives. I was also pleasantly surprised by some of the other things that I can do with this scanner as well. But first: putting it together.\n\nIt's fairly easy to set up the scanner. Simply take it out of the box, plug in the plug to power the top of the unit (if you're using this to scan negatives, you'll need this backlight, for everything else you can keep it unplugged), plug in the power cord and get the USB ready. Note: there is a lock that covers the USB, probably to help protect it if you were going to be traveling a lot with you scanner (who would do that, I don't know, it's too big for easy travel), so you will probably have to slide that over so you could access the USB port. Be sure to take off all the blue tape, both outside of the unit as well as on the inside cover of the top. Also note that the inside top cover has a lock as well; this is for the scanner head, and you may have to unlock it prior to actually scanning (I did).\n\nBefore plugging in the USB to my computer, I installed the various driver and application components on the CD. This actually took a lot longer than expected. I have a fairly fast PC with a 52X ROM, and it took close to five minutes to install the various applications (Creativity Suite, FineReader 6.0 Spirit (an OCR program), the scanning application and the User's Guide). There is also an accompanying CD with Adobe Photoshop Elements (4.0 for Windows, 3.0 for Mac), but as a Photoshop CS3 user, I didn't bother to install this.\n\nRegistering the product is fairly easy. The unit's ID can be found on the back left of the unit. Be warned that you will be taken to a Web page offering a discount on an unrelated product with a big download button; you don't actually need the product and don't need to download more stuff.\n\nSince I picked this primarily for scanning negatives, this was what I first tried with the unit. The scanner comes with two holder plates, and you can do 35mm film negatives and slides on one plate, and medium film on the other. I was scanning 35mm color negatives, and so I placed them in the appropriate holder and snapped on the top of the holder. Scanning the negatives straight away is fairly straightforward. You simply press the scan button on the front of the unit. This will start the Epson Scan application, and you'll be able to set various things that will allow you to get the best scan possible (more on this below).\n\nI'm going to take a break here and detail the error I made in my first attempt to scan negatives so that you, kind reader, do not make the same mistake. After putting the negative holder on the glass, I removed the reflective back from the top of the unit to expose the light area (fairly simple to remove it and put it back on, even has a handy little handle at the top, too). What I didn't notice was that each section of the holder has a letter corresponding to where you should place the tab on the corresponding indent on the unit. 35mm negatives use the ""A"" section, and I had placed the holder on the ""C"" section. I kept getting an error message saying that it couldn't see that there was a document to scan. This confused me for a bit, and I wound up using the Home and Professional modes to see if I could get my negatives to scan. When I had unchecked the thumbnails feature for preview, I saw that only the slides area was being scanned. I then realized my error, and adjusted the position of the holder on the tab indents accordingly. The top unit only has a small glass area for the top light, and so the scanner, obviously, will only scan that small area. You can actually see this in the photograph of the unit on the Amazon page. Once I corrected my error, I had no problem scanning my negatives.\n\nBack to the Epson Scan application. There are three options for you to choose from: Auto, Home and Professional. Auto simply auto-detects the type of document you are trying to scan and uses default settings to produce the preview of the document. Home and Professional are for photos and negatives. The difference between the two is that Professional provides you with more options to choose from so that you can get the best scan you require for your needs. Unless you're into heavily working your photos, your best bet is to go with the Auto feature.\n\nScanning photos and documents is also quite easy. You need to make sure that the reflective piece is on the top of the unit. This will also ensure that your document does not move around on the glass. Scanning, again, is simple as pressing a button.\n\nI wanted to try out FineReader with this unit, as well as the PDF button. For FineReader, I loaded up the program, and pressed a button within it (Scan), to get the document scanned and loaded into FineReader. I was easily able to get the OCR to work nicely with the document without problem.\n\nFor PDFs, I simply pressed the PDF button. This brought up a different PDF-specific application with a different dialog than the scanning application. Because the unit does not have a feeder, you will have to manually scan individual pages yourself. Creating the PDF then requires you to simply press the finish button; the document is then placed in your My Pictures directory if you are a Windows user. It would be nice to be able to state where you want the file to save, but that's a minor flaw.\n\nI also attempted to import a scan within Photoshop. I've done this before with other scanners, and Photoshop had zero issues with the scanner application, and everything worked smoothly.\n\nThere is a third button for email, by the way, however, I don't have email set up on my machine and so I did not test this feature out.\n\nI'm very pleased with this product. I found the scans to be quite sharp, and the scan process to be intuitive. I can see a novice with scanners not having too much of a problem with this unit, save for the holder issue I discussed earlier.";Nice scanner
78;7.0;1.0;93.0;Right out of the box, this was clearly a nice unit.  Set-up was hassle free.  I had about 300 old slides to scan, as well as 30 rolls of old black and white 35mm film negatives.  The software that came with the scanner had some really nice features as well.\n\nI wasn't sure what resolution to set the scans at, so I went on line to get some advice.  The prevailing wisdom was 2400 dpi, if you wanted 8 x 10 prints.  This resulted in a 20MB file!!!  There was a compression setting as well, and I had no idea at all what to set it to, so I experimented, and finally figured out settings that worked.  There wasn't really anything in the Epson manual that was very helpful.\n\nThe actual scans were good - crisp pictures, worthy of printing.  However, after about two rolls of film, I unplugged the scanner, boxed it up, and sent it back.  My unresolvable gripe?  The film holder would not consistently keep the negatives in place.  I had to cut the film into 6 negative sections.  This film was from the 40's and 50's, and wanted to stay rolled up.  I would put it in the film holders, and quite frequently, they would pop open - quite unexpectedly, and I would have to start all over again.  The problem is with the design of the film holder.  The top sections that hold the film in place have thin sides, and they flex quite a bit, and won't stay locked into place.  For me, this was frustrating, wasn't going to get better, and was a deal breaker.\n\nI ended up getting a Canon CanoScan 8800F, and it is flawless!  The film holders are more robust, and I had no popping open issues at all.  The quality was every bit as good as the Epson, and interestingly enough, at a high dpi scan rate (2400), I ended up with about a 2MB file - I am really much happier with this unit.;I Really Wanted This To Work - Flimsy Film Holders
82;8.0;5.0;58.0;"With thousands of B/W film negatives (2-1/4"" square, 35mm and half-frame 35mm) and an equal number of 35mm color slides, I was mainly interested in how well this scanner would handle such transparent media.  The answer is:  very well!  Scanning is still tedious, of course, as only 4 slides or 2 medium format negatives can be scanned with each pass, but the results are excellent.  I've got many hours of work ahead of me, but it's great to know that I'm not compromising on the quality of the output.";Excellent scanner!
103;9.0;5.0;55.0;A few reviews mentioned a weakness of this scanner was that it was slow. I however had absolutely zero issues with how long it took to scan in fact it is extremely fast on my machine (under 8 seconds for a 4X6 on 600 Res)even when using the digital ice technology and other enhancement options (under 15 seconds). The scanner does a beautiful job and everything I have scanned so far has been great.\n\nCan also be used to scan directly into Photoshop CS2 which is a huge benefit when doing lots of older pictures that need restoration work. Film scans looked good, not great, but it does offer high quality film scans considering this is not an independent film scanner.\n\nI personally liked the software that came with the Epson, very easy to use. Some people mentioned that settings did not remain in place when scanning multiple photos which is incorrect. If you set the scanner options the way you want, there is a check box that says reset settings after each scan. Uncheck that and your ready to go!\n\nThe Epson V500 can scan multiple images at once and separate them into their own files, another huge advantage when using CS2. I did not use the supplied copy of Adobe Elements and I strongly recomend not using it because it is very limited in what enhancements you can do to your photos.\n\nAll in all, this is a great scanner. Very powerful and fantastic results. Works wonderful in Vista and is extremely fast depending on your setup.;Wonderful Results!
4;10.0;5.0;55.0;The color quality and speed of this scanner is amazing. The actual scan speed is about double that of Epson's previous Perfection scanners.\n\nThis is an amazing scanner. It adapts its light for the best color rendition on almost any surface. In my experiments it handled matt, glossy, and highly reflective surfaces without any problems.\n\nThe one problem I have had is installing the drivers on my twenty inch intel Mac. I've been unable as yet to get the front panel buttons to work. I'm sure that Epson will come out with the new install software soon.\n\nI have been using scanners now for twenty years, the color rendition of this scanner matches some of the best I've ever seen.;An almost perfect scanner
91;11.0;4.0;43.0;"I researched slide and film scanners for quite a while. This came out to be the best product for money on the market in terms of features, specs and other reviewers on a lot of web sites. The install went without a problem. Software installed with no glitches. Scanned in a bunch of slides, even the old poorly maintained ones came out great ( I'm talking 50 year old slides!).  With my Canon, these old ones were so covered in dust as to be almost unusable. ICE did a great job cleaning these up. Loved how it took the 4 slides and automatically created 4 seperate files. NO CROPPING!\n\nIf I have any knocks, it would be the included Photoshop Elements version 4 software. Other scanners are shipping with version 5. Epson went a little cheap here. A hard copy manual would be really nice addition. Instead, you have an ""online help system"". I really prefer a book.\n\nFinal recomendation.... Look no futher unless you have a lot more money to burn, this is the product. Buy it.";Almost perfection
106;12.0;1.0;39.0;"I bought this scanner for a business trip, when I knew I would absolutely need to scan images, and couldn't bring my all-in-one Epson printer with me.\nThe set-up was really easy, but THEN...\nI have a Mac Powerbook G 4. I usually scan directly into photoshop, using the twain import function. I tried to do the same with this scanner, and lo and behold... Photoshop would not recognize the scanner for some time, until it crashed entirely: not only could I not scan the images I needed to work on urgently, but I could not even open photoshop anymore. It crashed, everytime I tried to open it, while opening twain...\nI called customer service as soon as I realized that photoshop wasn't recognizing the scanner. It was the beiginning of a 6 hours adventure on the phone with various customer services at Epson and Photoshop. Epson kept putting me on hold.... for 30 to 60 min. at a time, passing me on to various useless cutomer service representatives, to whom I had to repeat the same information over and over again, until I finally got to the ""specialist"" (the same one each time). It was when I was on the phone with him the first time that Photoshop crashed entirely. When it happened and I communicated that to him, the line miraculously broke off! I had to call again, put on hold again, passed through all the loops again, got that same specialist, gave my ""case number"" again, started menionning the photoshop problem and.... THE LINE CUT OFF AGAIN!!\nThis happened three times in total.\nThey finally said  ""the scanner is working, it is a problem with photoshop... call them""\nThe worst part of it is: the scanner comes with a cd of photoshop elements 3.0... I would think that since they send the photoshop cd along with the scanner, the two are compatible! I installed the photoshop elements hoping that I could at least use that during my stay out of town... same problem. When I called photoshop to try to understand what the problem was, they asked me to register the Photoshop Elements 3.0... I gave the serial number, and they refused to help me out because the product had already been registered... BY EPSON!!\n\nDid I hear someone mention Kafka?\n\nSOLUTION: if this problem happened to you, I finally found a semi-resolution on the internet, in five minutes (after my lost day on the phone): you have to disable twain from your Photoshop Applications folder:\nMac HD> Applications > Adobe Photoshop > Plug-ins > Import/Export > Twain\nJust rename the Twain by adding a ~ infront of it (call it ~twain) and it disables it... you won't be able to import anything via phhotoshop, but at least your photoshop will be working again!\n\nApart from that, the scanner works fine.\nMoral of the story: back from my business trip, I found my Epson all-in-one printer having died during my trip (an interesting coincidence). I bought an HP in replacement and will return the scanner as well. I am done with Epson forever.";ATTENTION PHOTOSHOP USERS! TWAIN MALFUNCTION
85;13.0;5.0;35.0;First review I've ever written! I'm analytical by nature and drive myself nuts gathering info necessary to make an educated decision. I've started a preservation project, aiming to scan a couple of thousand photos onto DVDs for my family. As the gatekeeper I wanted to create a quality heirloom. I am only working with photos, not film or slides, so can only speak for the results in front of me. Some of my photos are a hundred years old, and many from the last 50 years have that yellow film that comes with age. As far as I am concerned this scanner is MAGIC! Most of my friends have seen the results and all want the name of the scanner to buy one like it! The film of age is literally removed during the scan...reminds me of one of the TV commercials. In addition, Amazon had the lowest price along with free shipping! A double win!;It's a 5 star only because that's as high as it goes!
3;14.0;2.0;34.0;I wish I had read the review by Steve Kass below instead of spending 3 days on the phone with tech support.  Scanning a 2 1/4 negative to 11x11 file went from 3 minutes with my old Epson 1650 to almost 12 minutes with the V500.  It stalled at the 2 minute mark while the scanner stopped responding for 4 minutes before picking back up.  The scan looked good but when you multiply that time by a sheet of negatives it's unrealistic.  Returning the V500 and hooking the 1650 back up until I find something better.;Way to slow and it stalls
104;15.0;4.0;32.0;"When I read the poor reviews here on Amazon, I was hesitant to purchase this scanner.  I have had the scanner for 2 days now and I have done about 15 scans -- all of which have been medium format negative film (color and b/w).  I am importing directly into Photoshop CS, scanning 6""x6"" at 300 dpi.\n\nSo far, I have been happy w/the speed of the scans and scan quality, especially considering the price of the scanner.  6x6 at 300 dpi w/no ICE takes about 1 to 1.5 min to scan.  If I turn on the ICE feature, it seems like the scans take about 2.5-3.5 min.  My first attempt w/ICE came out poorly b/c I was scanning a black and white negative, I later found out that ICE does not work for black and white negs on the Epson site.  I tried ICE again today with color negatives and it worked well -- no banding, mystery marks, etc.\n\nOnly complaint so far - as noted by another reviewer - is that the negative carriers are flimsy and feel very cheap.\n\nFrom my experience, I give the V500 a thumbs up.";Epson V500 - working well for negatives
27;16.0;1.0;25.0;I was initially thrilled with this scanner. I have been scanning 100s of old photos and documents from the early 1900s. The image quality was great UNTIL the scanner started producing a vertical red line just over two inches from the right side of the scanner bed for the entire length of the bed.  This line appears on anything scanned at any dpi--b/w or color.  It is now only used for scanning insignificant documents for emailing.\n\nEpson has NO 800# for tech support.  I eventually learned that it would cost more to repair than to replace.  I will not ever purchase another Epson product again.\n\nThere is no way to know if the one you purchase will start doing this...or when.  Go with another brand.;produces red line--now scanner is useless
92;17.0;3.0;25.0;"I've been using the scanner to scan negatives and slides. I think this scanner works quite well, however there are several software pitfalls waiting for the advanced user who wants total scanner control. First if you use ""At Home Mode"" the scanner automatically applies the unsharp mask even though there is no indication it is doing so. Not all unsharp masks are equal and if you zoom to pixels level you can see that this one is a bit heavy handed. It is much better to capture the raw scan data and then apply the unsharp mask (to your liking) in Photoshop. The second pitfall is the apparent inability of the program to maintain your settings in ""Professional Mode"". For example in professional mode there is a check box for Unsharp Mask. Uncheck Unsharp Mask and then do a preview scan. The check on Unsharp Mask reappears as if the machine is unhappy with your selection. If you recall saved settings it demands that you redo the preview scan and your back to square one. Hopefully there is fix in the works. Anyway if you are a casual user you probably won't notice the flaws.";Great resolution, software needs work
37;18.0;5.0;22.0;"V500 Scanner: 5 STARS, software: 4 stars.\n\n  Quality:  5 stars\nEase of use:  5 stars\n  Cost:  5 stars\nFlexibility:  5 stars\n  Software:  4 stars (it has some weird quirks, work-arounds are simple)\n\nSuits my needs, and for around $200, it's a great deal.\n\nI am scanning Kodachrome 64 primarily, for archive reasons.  Generally, I've been very pleased.  The dust removal feature works nicely almost all the time.  I am scanning at 6400 dpi and you can clearly see the KC-64 grain at this resolution.  (The scanner ""goes to 11"" as well:  It says it will go to 12,000 dpi, which I haven't used:  For KC-25 maybe?)  You can see a slight pixelating effect on the grain; but the grain is obvious.  It is a notable improvement over my older 3200 dpi scans:  Quite noticeable on large (13X19) prints.  The color is true.  The resulting scans are beautiful and very true to the slide image.  The slide holder is very easy to use.\n\nI am scanning in the ""Professional"" mode, using Unsharp Mask checked on and Dust Removal checked on (only these two) and usually run the dust removal at ""High"" unless it has issues (I've had it do a couple of things I didn't like when set to ""High"":  darkening in star trails on long night exposures and on one shot with climbers on a glacier, it filled in one of the figures (!) well, they were small and dark against the ~white background.  That one was kind of humorous actually.)\n\nThe ICE feature doesn't work well with KC-64.  I haven't needed to use it.  When using the ICE feature, small highlit areas became grossly exaggerated and looked like little burned-out white glow worms pasted onto the object in the slide:  Very ugly effect.  I only tried it a couple of times, so I don't know the ins and outs of it.\n\nI don't recommend the ""color restoration"" feature unless you have truly faded or damaged images.  It gave weird color shifts when used on regular images.\n\nIt's slow at 6400 dpi, as expected.  It takes about 2 minutes per slide.\n\nIt has this quirk:  I can preview scan four slides at a time (which is nice, less time brushing off the glass, etc.) but when I select all four slides for the final scan (I would prefer to do this and then walk away for 5-8 minutes and do something else while it's scanning) it seems to ""forget"" my settings on the scan menus.  That is:  It applies the dust removal feature only to the first scan.  Annoying.  So, I now preview all together, then scan individually.  This seems to do the trick.  More than likely, if I read the manual, I could solve this ... (you know:  manual, schmanual ...)\n\n[Update on 11-Aug-09:  I figured out how to make it apply the settings to all four slides:  The little check boxes beneath each thumbnail are used to tell it which slides to scan.  The blue ""select"" rings around the thumbnail (click on the thumbnail to activate) are used to tell the SW to apply the settings (such as dust removal) to the scans.  I suppose there's some logic there:  You may want to select these separately.  But how about two check boxes, with labels??]\n\nIt indicates that you can save your scanning settings - and it does save them; but wipes them out for every preview.  If you select the settings saved, you have to re-do the preview scan ... and it wipes the settings again. You have to set options manually after every preview.  Another annoying issue.  But, once you get into the flow of scanning, it sort of becomes automatic.\n\nI've made pdfs and scanned a number of types of photos in color and B&W as well with very nice results.  Sometimes it does take a few tries to get the right settings in the ""Professional"" mode.  No big deal.  I made one scan in the ""Family"" mode (or maybe it was ""home"" mode).  It didn't have any settings to choose as a far as I could see and scanned slides at about 300 or 600 dpi.  Might be OK for 3X5 prints.  Garbage for anything else.  Use only the ""Professional"" mode.\n\nI just noticed this on Wikipedia:  ""Kodachrome 64 and Kodachrome 64 Professional 135 format were discontinued in June 2009""  The end of a great era ...  I have to admit, I haven't bought any in many years ...\n\n[Update on 17-Aug-2009:]\nI now have about 350 KC-64 scans completed and I am very pleased with the results.  I have also scanned about 100 color and B&W prints at from 300dpi to 1200dpi, depending on print size) ranging in size from 8""X10"" to 2""X2"", again with excellent results.  Print scanning is much faster (20-30 sec) than the 6400dpi slide scanning.  The only issue with the prints is that the scans pitilessly show up the flaws in the prints:  Almost too accurate ...  Excellent little scanner.  Amazing what this thing does for the money.\n\n[Update on 31-Aug-2009:]\nI have performed about 1000 scans now, about half were Kodachrome 64 slides and amost all the remainder old B&W prints.  Most recently, I've scanned some of my old B&W negatives (Bulk Tri-X-Pan 135, developed in Microdol-X 3:1, 75F, wonderful results) and the resulting scans, though they don't have the tone or character I could acheive in darkroom prints, really came out quite nicely.  Color prints also scan very nicely.  I will be trying some color negatives soon.\n\nI am more and more pleased with this scanner.  Now I need to spend some time in Photoshop fixing up the old B&W images (some date back to the 1870s, I'm glad to have these archived in digital now!)  Bottom line:  Great scanner, great price.\n\n[Update on 14-Sep-2009:]\nI am up to about 2000 scans now, including about 300 color negatives (I think they are Kodacolor 100 -- I didn't shoot the film.)  These also come out very nicely.  All around consistent, great results.\n\nMy scanner, purchased earlier this year, included Photoshop Elements 6.0, which does about anything you might want in photo editing if you're not a professional.\n\n[Update on 13-Oct-2009:]\nI've probably done 2500 scans now and I've managed to archive, to digital high-resolution scans, essentially all of my old photos that I really care about preserving (no matter what).  I've burned multiple copies on sets of DVDs that are now in various locations for safe-keeping.  In addtion, I've been able to post ""dumbed-down"" versions to the web as sort an ultimate photo album that my family and friends can view anytime they feel like and even make prints from.  [I'm fully converted from a rather Luddite, all-manual, all Kodachrome and Tri-X-Pan guy (I never even used the light meters in my cameras, except in very unusual situations) to an all-digital guy (frequently using the auto-focus and auto-exposure modes in my DSLR!)  It wasn't even painful.]\n\n[Update 20-Nov-2009]:  I have no idea how many scans I've done now; but the number is large.  I am now scanning slides (Ektachrome 100 and Kodachrome 64) at 1200 dpi (less artistically worthy shots, just scanning for completeness and archiving).  The great news is:  This machine does 4 slide scans at 1200 dpi in less than a minute (no enhancements used.)  And the result s plenty good for web use (jpeg of about 1700X1100 pixels, 250KB size).  Fast, fast, fast.  And they really look great.\n\n[Update 10-Feb-2010]:  I have now done about 6000 scans, the vast majority on Kodachrome 64.  This update is simply to report what I consider a sweet-spot in the dpi for 35mm slides for quality vs. speed.  2400 dpi works very well for almost any use and is much, much faster than 4800/6400/12,000.  I note that 2400 dpi on this scanner looks much better than 2400 dpi looked on my old Canon scanner.  The great majority of my work will now be at 2400 dpi.  2400 dpi on 35mm (135 format) film full-frame = approx. 3400 X 2260 = 7.7 MPixel which is good enough for almost anything.  The KR-64 grain is visible.\n\n[Update 22-Mar-2011]:  Scan count is about 20,000 now.  No issues!  I love this scanner!\n\nComputer used:  Dell Dimension 2400, vintage 2004, ~2.5GHz clock speed, 2GB RAM, Windows XP Professional, very large harddrive.\n\n[Update:  22-Mar-2011:  New Dell Studio Win 7, 12GB RAM, 1TB HD:  Works great, same old scanner, plug and play.]\n\nBesides this product, I'm using these with great results:\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Canon-Pixma-PRO9000MkII-Inkjet-Photo-Printer-3295B002/dp/B001R4BTIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Canon Pixma PRO9000MkII Inkjet Photo Printer (3295B002)</a>\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pentax-K-x-12-4-MP-Digital-SLR-with-2-7-inch-LCD-and-18-55mm-f-3-5-5-6-AL-Lens-Black/dp/B002OEBTC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pentax K-x 12.4 MP Digital SLR with 2.7-inch LCD and 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 AL Lens (Black)</a>\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pentax-70mm-f-2-4-DA-Limited-Lens-for-Pentax-and-Samsung-Digital-SLR-Cameras/dp/B000INZRZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pentax 70mm f/2.4 DA Limited Lens for Pentax and Samsung Digital SLR Cameras</a>\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pentax-DA-40mm-f-2-8-Ultra-Compact-Lens-for-Pentax-and-Samsung-Digital-SLR-Cameras/dp/B00077KMXG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pentax DA 40mm f/2.8 Ultra Compact Lens for Pentax and Samsung Digital SLR Cameras</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pentax-100mm-f-2-8-WR-D-FA-smc-Macro-Lens-for-Pentax-Digital-SLR-Cameras/dp/B0030GGS3O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pentax 100mm f/2.8 WR D FA  smc Macro Lens for Pentax Digital SLR Cameras</a>\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Epson-B11B189011-Epson-Perfection-V500-Photo-Scanner/dp/B000VG4AY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">B0013545U2 Da 300MM F4 Ed (if) Sdm Lens</a>\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sigma-18-50mm-f-2-8-EX-DC-SLD-ELD-Aspherical-Macro-Lens-for-Pentax-and-Samsung-Digital-SLR-Cameras/dp/B000JDKFXK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sigma 18-50mm f/2.8 EX DC SLD ELD Aspherical Macro Lens for Pentax and Samsung Digital SLR Cameras</a>\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tamron-AF-70-200mm-f-2-8-Di-LD-IF-Macro-Lens-for-Pentax-and-Samsung-Digital-SLR-Cameras/dp/B0012GHSF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tamron AF 70-200mm f/2.8 Di LD IF Macro Lens for Pentax and Samsung Digital SLR Cameras</a>\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pentax-14mm-f-2-8-DA-ED-IF-Lens-for-Pentax-and-Samsung-Digital-SLR-Cameras/dp/B0007WQ5LY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pentax 14mm f/2.8 DA ED (IF) Lens for Pentax and Samsung Digital SLR Cameras</a>\n\nThe PENTAX  14mm, 40mm, 70mm, 100mm, and 300mm are very sharp, bright, fast, good contrast, very limited CA.

42;19.0;5.0;22.0;By way of credentials, I'm a serious amateur photographer who has won prizes in several international photography contests and various regional competitions. My work has been published in a number of books, calendars, and catalogs. Point is, I enjoy photography and have some knowledge of it.\n\nI spent a long time on line reading the reviews, looking at sample scans, technical specs, and reading long-winded debates about the merits of a dedicated film scanner (typically one of the Nikon Coolscans), versus a flatbed like the V500. Yes, if you are making large prints (above 11x14) AND are concerned about the absolute sharpness, then you'll need to shell out a thousand bucks or more for the film scanner. I'm sure you'll be happy with it.\n\nBut if, like me, have hundreds of old slides to scan for an album or to put online, then you simply can't go wrong with the Epson V500. The software that comes with the scanner is quite adequate. Sure the scans can sometimes benefit with a bit of work in a photo editing program, but so do images coming out of $3,000 digital SLRs.\n\nBottom line: If you have a bunch of old slides or photos that you want to digitize for fun and family, then look no further.;Can't beat it for the price
19;20.0;5.0;17.0;"I was in the market for a scanner to do negatives, slides and prints and this one was recommended by a former colleague that had a side job working in a camera store, that did lots of scanning for clients. This was the scanner she had bought for home use.\nFiguring that anyone who did this professionally would be able to steer me to the best tool to buy for home use, I'm happy to say she was right.\n\nI have a great multi-function printer at home, that has a flat bed scanner, but you can't use those to do negatives and slides. Also since it was the family's printer it was not in a spot convenient to my computer to do one scan after the other.\n\nSEAMLESS SET UP\nThis scanner sets up seamlessly.  You have a CD of software and drivers and it takes only a few minutes to get the scanner up and running.  I also like the fact that the scanner lid holds it self up when you lift it.  That is a simple thing, but when you are scanning a lot of stuff, that is such a convenience.\n\nSCANNING SLIDES: QUICK AND EASY.\nFirst my boyfriend nabbed it before I even used it and scanned his entire family's collection of slides.  This scanner has an attachment that allows you to set in 4 slides at once, to prescan, then you do your final scan to create the file. It does a nice job of incrementing the numbers for you.  He complained that he needed to reset the output size with each scan, but I found the way around that was to use a custom setting or not use Thumbnails.  He had wanted the output size to be original versus 4 X 6"".\n\nWORKHORSE.\nNext I started in on my Dad's collection of prints, albums and negatives.  I haven't even gotten out the slides yet.  So far I have done over 2000 scans with this.  I have this scanner, sitting on my desk, so it is convenient to use.  The scanner itself is not that much bigger than it's maximum size scan, so it does not take up much room.\n\nQUICK SWAP OUT OF WHITE BACKING MAKE IT EASY TO CHANGE FORMATS\nThis scanner comes with the plastic parts that set in the scanner to hold slides and film.  The white background comes out when you do these transparent media.  It is really easy to swap these parts in and out. If you have odd format sizes, as I do, you can set them on the scanner without the film guides, but they must be in the center where the mirror is.  So I used post-it-notes on the glass to help locate the negatives.  This works well and leaves no residue. Post-it notes also has a fully sticky tape that really works well for this.\n\nMORE USES THAN JUST PHOTOS, IF CONVENIENT\nOne thing I found by having this scanner so convenient, is that I have taken to scanning in recipes and articles (like yoga routines) that catch my eye in magazines and storing them on my computer.  It allows you to ditch all the paper and keep only what you need. You need to be rigorous in naming and filing but it also makes this more handy as you don't have to dig through a bunch of magazines to find what you want.  I had not anticipated this plus.\n\nCOOL ASPECT\nI had stacks of old format negatives that had not seen the light of day in years.  When I scanned them the scanner took these negatives and converted them to the positives that prints could be made from, or pictures that could be used in stuff like photo books. I found this utterly fascinating watching the pictures appear magically. I know that is not so stupendous, but I found it utterly cool.  Also I had some albums that I just unbound  the pages and put the whole page on the scanner.  Using a pre-scan, I could locate the pictures I wanted to capture, and save separately.  If the page is too big, first I did one half and then the other.  This is great if you have fragile old albums that you don't want to risk removing the pictures from.  For that matter if you can open the pages wide enough, you don't have to unbind the albums.\nThe color restoration option also took some horrible looking prints from the 1960s to passable.  That was merely checking a box when needed.\n\nSUMMARY\nThis was an entirely utilitarian purchase. I had tons of stuff that needed scanning and did not want to pay a fortune to do so.  This scanner fit the bill nicely and has lead me to use it for a variety of other items. It went from utility to fun and that was cool.";Highly recommended and fun to see all that it could do!
35;21.0;1.0;20.0;"This scanner, which markets itself as a great value for relatively high quality negative scanning, is a joke because of the driver that comes with it. Shame on epson for creating such sub-par software, thus making their hardware useless. I've only ever used professional mode; i know what I'm doing and i still can not get anything worthwhile.\n\n-color restoration is always off\n-the prescan capture is just bad, making it impossible to adjust for proper color and density\n-the 120 film attachment barely fits 2 frames of a piece of film, so you can really only scan one image at a time, unless you like the scanner cutting your horizontals into verticals\n\nI thought this scanner would be a good for a professional on a budget. I've used higher end epson scanners before with no problems. In fact, the 1640xl, which is YEARS older than this scanner gives me better results. I've found that using a 3rd party software like Silverfast can reign in all the problems of the epson software. I've seen the difference in scans and i know the problems I've experienced are driver related. But Silverfast costs more than this scanner, so what's the point? If you're a professional or semi-pro looking to scan negatives on a budget, you'd be better off saving up for the v700 or v750, both of which come with a free version of Silverfast. I'm going to sell the v500 and save up for the v750.";the software makes this scanner completely un-usable
26;22.0;1.0;18.0;I have always had Epson scanners, and only decided to upgrade because of the new ICE technology for scanning heritage photos.  In that sense, the scanner does not disappoint - it is fast, the images are wonderful and clear, and I have a computer full of nice JPGs of family history.  I also have a scanner that is 1 yr, 3 mos old that is sitting in an Epson repair shop, with a fried motherboard.  Cost to fix?  $98.  According to the repair shop, this is something that is commonly happening with the V500s and has been fixed with the V600 series.  So save your money on this one and go for the V600 instead.;Great scanner, if you only need it for a year.
67;23.0;4.0;19.0;I was eager to try out this scanner.  Several years ago we bought a Canonscan 9950F to convert all our film into digital.  At that time I converted 12,000 negatives into digital format.  Since then I have used my Canonscan mainly as a flatbed scanner, although occasionally I need to convert a few negatives, for other people or when we use a disposable camera.\n\nI set it up on a Dell Dimension 8100 on an external powered usb port.  No problems with installation, I was up and running in under 10 minutes.\n\nTo compare I took a new set of negatives and scanned 6 shots in both the Canonscan and the Epson both at the same resolution and using the dust and scratch removal programs for both.  Here are my comparisons\n\nThe Canonscan is faster, it took about 7 minutes to scan the 6 shots.\nThe Epson took a little longer, 9 minutes for 6 shots.  The quality of the Epson was better, dust removal was more precise and the Epson software was better able to pick up where the edges of a very light photo were than the Canon.  I wonder if the LED, (being one wavelength) helps with this clarity.\n\nHowever, the Epson only has 2 slots for putting your negatives into on the plastic mask.  Theoretically it can hold 12 images, but that is only if that is how your negatives are cut.\nIf your negatives have, say, 5 images each, you are only going to be able to do 10 a time unless you are willing to cut up the negatives.\n\nThe Canonscan mask has 5 slots, each for 6 negatives.  In theory you could do 30,  but I found that because of how the negatives were cut I could usually do 24 to 28.\n\nNot an issue if you are just doing a few, but if you have a backlog of thousands it can make a real difference in how long the project would take.  The scan time is not hugely different but the time involved in physically placing the negatives into the slots and setting up the scan would take longer with the Epson.  The mask with the Epson is more difficult to work with than the Canon mask.  The Canon has a hinge on one side, the Epson the whole front snaps out.  It seems a bit flimsy, but so did the Canon and it lasted through the 12,000 scans.\n\nI really like the LED instant on being the impatient person that I am.  You do not have to wait for the scanner to warm up, great for a quicker scanning of a couple documents.\n\nThe Epson is much more intuitive.  It took me about 10 minutes to figure out how to scan a negative (I, too, made the error of not putting the mask in the correct place).  With the Canon I remember it taking me an hour to get the general idea and a couple hours to figure out exactly how to get it to do what I wanted.\n\nI also could not get the front buttons to work, but you can do it all from the software.  Being able to scan to a PDF is really nice.;Excellent quality for negative scans, but could take a while to scan a lot of negatives.
8;24.0;5.0;7.0;"Over the past 37 years, I have shot thousands of photographs on print and slide film. While I stored them away in a climatically controlled environment, with proper image preservation techniques; thus, many of the color negatives have started to either fade, or being the color shift process. The only film that is still 100 percent stable after all of these years are the Kodachrome slides, which in hindsight, I wish I would have chosen more often over the years as the film of choice. However, I tended to chose print film so I could share these treasured images with my friends at the time.\n\nI did a lot of research into image scanners, and chose this Epson model over several others. Epson, has much better image resolution quality than products from their competitors. This unit allows you to choose 35mm color print or slide film, or even some of the medium format versions like 680 film. However, it does a magnificent job on various sized prints.\n\nMoreover, I also loved the fact this model came with Adobe editing software, to help enhance some of the images that have become faded or damaged over the years. Some really faded photographs from the 1950s, look like they were shot yesterday on a digital camera. I really feel this scanner was a wise investment, and with over 10,000 images that I have been scanned, it's still going strong. I highly recommend it.";Great Image Scanner For The Price
84;25.0;1.0;19.0;About one week ago, I bought the Epson Perfection V500 Photo scanner from Staples.  I had planned on buying a Canon but Staples was out of the Canon and I impulsively bought the Epson.  I am paying dearly for my impulsivity.  I have wasted about 10 to 15 hours trying to make this Epson V500 function properly.  It is atrocious.  Here are some of the problems:\n\n1.  The Adobe Photoshop Elements software corrupted all my exiting pdf files.  It took hours to fix.  I finally uninstalled the Epson Adobe software and then reinstalled my pdf software.  Thank goodness, my existing pdf files survived the the fiasco so that I can once again make pdf's and read my pdf's.\n\n2.  A lot of my work involves inserting photographs into text files, WordPerfect or Word. I can find no way to make Epson cooperate in this task.\n\n  2-A:  It takes a very, very long time to scan a photo.  I have to get up leave, go outside do some gardening (fortunately this is Southern California and the flower planting season is in full swing) and then come back to the computer.\n\n  2-B:  Photos scanned by Epson will not insert into the text files.\n\n3.  In order to make my presentations, I now have to print out the text, manually attach the photos to the paper, and then scan it with my color copy machine. I used to be able to do this process with a few key strokes.\n\n4.  Epson V500 won't Scan to Print.\n\n5.  I cannot make the Epson V500 enlarge or crop images.\n\nI routinely enlarge and crop sections from books, newspapers, letters and then print the enlarged cropped section.  Since Epson does not Scan to Print and it does not enlarge nor does it Crop, I can no longer place a book on the scanner and then enlarge a single paragraph to print out.\n\n6.  It has no written manual, making it impossible for me to flip through the pages.  The CD manual is of virtually useless.  Maybe the CD manual has the information about enlargement and cropping hidden somewhere.  My old machine, HP Scanjet, had it on the screen as soon as I called up the program.\n\n7.  I had to remove the scanned Epson photos as they were interferring with my computer's speed -- if I tried to use an Epson scanned photo, my entire computer slowed down to the point I thought it was totally locked up.\n\nThere may be some specialized work for which this Epson is appropriate, but it is a Perfect Nightmare for me.  I am taking my HP Scanjet to the repair shop and hopefully it is something repairable.;Epson Perfection V500 = Perfect Nightmare
55;26.0;1.0;18.0;"I just puchased this scanner and over the New Year's holiday, while watching bowl games, scanned over 700 negatives into computer.  The LED lighting is what makes this a relatively fast consumer-grade scanner.  I installed it on Windows Vista x64 with no trouble and got it working right away, BUT the included Adobe Photoshop Elements v4.0 softwre would not install.  WHY is Epson saying this is Vista-compatible when a vital piece of software, and one of the reasons for buying this ""package"", will not work??  I contacted Epson, who told me to contact Adobe.  I called Adobe and finally talked to a Customer Service Supervisor (""Alan"" in India) who stated ""Adobe does not support Photoshop Elements ver 4.0 that is bundled with the Epson V500 Scanner.  We recommend that you purchase a retail version of Photoshop Elements.""  How is that for bait-and-switch?\n\nThis product scenario seems ripe to me for a class-action lawsuit that all software makers should worry about - Selling outdated software with your product and claiming false compatibility, all to get the end-user to spend more money.  I am going to file a formal complaint with both my State Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission about this product against Epson.  I would also be happy to take the lead in a class-action lawsuit as the principal aggreved party.";Good Scanner but Beware Software!!
9;27.0;5.0;13.0;"I just received this last week, and have only just played around with it, but so far, I'm really impressed!  My only complaint is that I wish the setup instructions had more words and not just pictures.  I ended up calling customer support, since I had several things wrong in the setup.  I didn't know that little arrow meant to take the top plate OUT when I want to scan film!\n\nI have a Mac, and the first thing I read was NOT to insert the software CD, but to download the drivers from the Epson site.  That went very smoothly.\n\nI have thousands of film and slides I want to scan, and am waiting for a visit from my son in a few weeks before I really start the process.  I want him to help me select the best settings and set up a smooth procedure for saving the pictures.\n\nI love the quick ""preview"" so I can select which pictures to scan.  I have experimented with both film and slides, and both looked great.\n\nI have a few 110 negatives, and there are instructions for that, but I haven't tried it.\n\nI'm so glad I bought this, rather than one of the stand-alone film scanners.  I can't wait to really get started with my project!\n\nUPDATE --\n\nI have begun my scanning project and think this scanner is a wonderful investment!  I am starting with negatives, and it's very easy to scan 35mm film.  You put the strips in the little slots, click ""thumbnails"", and it lets you preview and pick which pictures you want to scan.  It takes several minutes to do a quality 2400dpi scan, but you just need something else to do while you wait.\n\nI have figured out how to manage the 110 film, and fortunately, I don't have too much of that.  I put several strips side by side on the flatbed, and after the preview (without thumbnails), move the selected area to encompass just the set of negatives.  Then, I have to use Photoshop to separate each one.  It's a pain, but these are pictures of my firstborn when he was a baby!\n\nANOTHER UPDATE:\n\nI have now logged about 2,000 negatives and am still in love with this scanner!  I hope it holds up for another several thousand negatives and slides!\n\nAnd, another update:\n\nI scanned over 5,000 negatives that covered the years my sons were growing up and I gave them external drives with all the pictures, plus making a Shutterfly photobook for each of them.\n\nNow, I'm starting on our many slides and some really old medium format negatives.\n\nStill love this scanner!\n\nAND STILL MORE!\n\nI'm now working on scanning slides that are 40-50 years old.  Most of them have turned reddish, and the ""color restoration"" feature of this software works wonders!  I know I can do the same in Photoshop, but this scanner software is much easier and you can do it with one click.  Just be SURE to check the ""ALL"" button in the preview window so that the editing items you check apply to all the images.\n\nI've scanned so many images with this scanner, I can't believe I haven't worn it out!  If I do, I'll certainly buy another one!";Over 5,000 negatives scanned and still going strong!
62;28.0;4.0;18.0;"The Epson V500 Photo scanner is an extremely nice unit.  It accommodates photographs, 35mm color negatives and B&W negatives, 35mm mounted slides, large format negatives, and documents up 8.5"" x 11"" and A4-sized sheets.\n\nThe scanned images are awesome!  I am extremely pleased with the job this scanner does with my old 35mm mounted slides.  I've also had great success scanning old family photos.\n\nHere's how the scanner works:\n\nFirst of all you must install the scanner software that accompanies this unit.  Once you have done that the scanner can be attached to the computer via a USB line.  Turn on the scanner's power switch, click on the ""Epson scan"" icon on your computer desktop, and select the mode that best matches your level of comfort and ability.\n\nThe scanner has three main functional modes: 1) Full Automatic, 2) Home, and 3) Professional.\n\nIf you are just getting started in the scanning world, select the ""Full Auto Mode"", place a document, photo, etc., that you want to scan on the glass scanning surface, click the ""scan"" icon on the Epson scan window and sit back and wait for the results to show up on screen.\n\nOh, this scanner comes with a set of plastic frames that includes openings that hold up to four mounted slides or up to two strips of six negatives each.\n\nIf you are a little more adventurous and want some additional control over the output image you can move up to the ""Home mode"".  This setting lets you choose the document type (photograph, photo negative, magazine page, etc.), the image type (color, grayscale, black and white), and a limited number of image adjustments.  FYI - ""Digital Ice"" technology that automatically optimizes the image, corrects scratches, etc., is available only for photos and photo negatives.\n\nIf you want complete control over the the output image, select the ""Professional mode.""  This setting allows you full flexiblity in choosing scanner settings, including sharpness, color, auto-exposure, histogram adjustment, tone correction, color palette access, grain reduction for high speed films, backlighting correction, dust removal, and Digital Ice optimization.  Again, remember that the Digital Ice option is available only for photographs, and photo negatives and positives.\n\nThe unit looks nice and has a relatively small footprint.  That's good because there's not much room on my computer desk.\n\nI have used similar scanners before, and I found the functionality of this model to be quite intuitive.\n\nIn addition, the Epson V500 scanner comes with a copy of Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0. This versatile image manipulation program can be used to work with your images once they are digitized.\n\nI do have a couple of minor complaints about this unit.  First, I don't find this unit to be particularly speedy.  For example, it takes 45 seconds for this unit to scan an 8.5"" x 11"" document and generate an image.  It takes the unit about 3.5 minutes to scan four slides and generate their images.  So, if you are going to be scanning lots of documents or slides, etc., I recommend that you have a book in hand to flip open once you hit the ""scan"" button.  Second, the Digital Ice setting works only with photographs and photonegatives.\n\nAll in all, this is a sweet little unit, and it should meet most people's scanning needs.\n\nFor the reasons listed above I give this scanner a solid 4-star rating.";NICE unit! ...but not too speedy...
83;29.0;5.0;18.0;I have just finished scanning 1800 slides into my computer and the process was so amazingly easy and fast!  I couldn't ask for anything more in a scanner! Most of our slides were from the 1970s, but some went back to the 1940s and now are safely preserved in digital form.  I used the 'Auto' scan with dust removal for most of the later slides and added the color restoration feature when necessary.  The slides from the 1940s and 50s required the 'Home' mode with Digital ICE feature and color restoration in effect.  ALL are beautifully bright and clear.  The installation was quick and I too, was scanning within 30 minutes.  I did notice, as others have said, the buttons on the front of the scanner did not do what I needed, but the on-screen menu replaced them and was easy to navigate.  The dust removal saved a lot of time touching up in iPhoto or Photoshop and old rose tinged or green or blue tinted photos were color corrected to a natural, realistic range.  I could not ask for anything more in a scanner and at the Amazon price, it has paid for itself many times over already.  Now I want to tackle our old photos .  .  .;Worth every penny!
105;30.0;4.0;18.0;I just got this scanner as an early Christmas present and I couldn't be happier. I'm running OS X on an intel Mac and had no trouble installing the drivers or using it with Photoshop. With black and white negatives, scanning has been a snap in Home Mode. Color negatives have been a bit more difficult. I've had to switch to Professional Mode and then do a bit of altering in Photoshop to get the colors to really pop. I haven't tried slide film or scanning photos/documents yet.\n\nMy only complaint is with the negative holders. They seem a bit too flimsy... and like they could break at any moment. Also, the Medium Format holder isn't nearly long enough. I can only scan two images at a time. Three would be better.;Great for B/W

45;32.0;5.0;16.0;This product has more than exceeded my expectations. I have slides and negatives that are over 35 years old, some that became discolored or faded, and prints much older, and this scanner instantly restored them to a state as if they were developed last week! The Digital ICE technology for dust and spot removal is incredible: I digitize transparancies typically at 4800 DPI and those with small spots had no artifacts, even zooming in to the known dust spot at full resolution. (These are small particles even a fine brush didn't remove.) I bought cleaners along with the scanner but have not had to use them. I have Kodachromes that turned pink with age and one checkbox instantly restored them to full color! For prints, you can distribute them across the glass and it finds each one and generates a file separately for each, sizing the scans properly. It does likewise for 35mm slides and negs but you need to use the included templates. I did have to make my own template for 2.25 in slides and to use the full capabilities takes some time to scan, but to me it's worth it. And you'd be amazed at how old Instamatic negatives come out! I usually run it overnight or setup a set of scans during a TV commercial. The resolution of the 2.25 scans even allows me to get good quality pictures of cropped sections of the original, basically creating new perspectives. In the pro mode, you can do a lot of image processing and cropping through the scanner's own software, prior to scanning. There are multiple modes of operation, the simplest being the default, so if you just want it to scan intelligently, it's pretty easy. I've been in technology for 40 years and this is one of the most amazing consumer devices I've ever seen, knowing the different engineering techniques that it is using. For the price, can't beat it.;Amazing device!
16;33.0;5.0;12.0;I have owned this scanner for 11 months now and so far love it. I have around 4000 slides from over 20 yrs and am scanning for slide shows showing two year periods per DVD. Don't do what I did though and scan 1/3 of the total slides only to find out the files are undersize. I had been scanning them in the Professional mode at a low dpi and ended up with 165 kb files which looked like post card size when I viewed them on the monitor. Starting over now in AUTO mode with dust removal at 300 dpi and getting 1 to 1 1/2 Mb files which will should view nicely on a flat screen for the slide shows and give you nice prints if that's what you want, and won't take up a chunk of your hard drive if you leave them sitting there. I will be archiving all 4000 slides on DVD's and then dumping the files from the computer. I plan on giving the full set of shows to each of our three children when finished, keeping one set for myself. Auto mode is pretty quick and fully adjusts for light and dark slides. It will get a very dark slide in a better position for editing so that you can then do an auto adjust on any editing program (I use Photo Impression 6) and come up with a lot better end result than the original. I also use a small soft cosmetic brush to dust off all the slides before the scan and that really makes a big difference on the dust problem especially with cardboard mounts. Picking the slides out of the slide holder is made really easy by using a small piece of painter's tape and merely touching that to the slide mount and lifting it out. Also I edit each scanned slide in my editing program as the scanner gets ahead of me so I'm scanning and looking over the scans at the same time. That really keeps it going very quickly. This scanner does not have a cooling fan and the electronics can and do burn out if it gets too hot. Let it sit for awhile after about 45 minutes of continuous scanning and then resume. Heard this from the repair center when I had the inside of the fogged glass cleaned (they actually sent it in per Epson's instructions and got me a new one because it was under warranty and it came with the fogged glass. Hope this helps. By the way, scans in the Auto mode are a little under 3 minutes total for four slides at the 300 dpi resolution.;Scanning Tips
33;34.0;1.0;14.0;Bought 10-9-2009 after reading reviews here and other places. Couldn't afford the V700 so I opted for the V500. Image quality was on par with what I read about but today the scanner would not scan film, which is why I bought it. The flat bed scanning still works but the part of the scanner in the lid that scans negatives has stopped working and displays an amber light on the scanner and an error message pops up in the Epson Scan software. Epson customer support is horrid!!! Talking with someone in India on a bad VOIP connection was extremely painful! My only options were to have it repaired or return it to Amazon and only get 85% of the price I paid since I was just past the 30 day mark.\n\nLesson learned. I will not buy another Epson scanner. Ever.\n\nHope you experience is better!;NOT THAT GOOD
38;35.0;5.0;14.0;December 2009 update:  I am almost through scanning my images and I am still extremely satisfied.  A few additional pointers:  I found the best quality was achieved with: 3200 dpi for negatives with the minimum jpg compression possible and 6400dpi for slides with a little bit of compression.  These images ended up aroud 5 to 8 megabytes.  At both resolutions, a fair amount of unsharp mask is needed which is best done in photoshop so if you don't intended to do any post processing, I would limit the resolution to 1200 dpi. This resolution or lower is also best for posting to sharing web sites. I have also tried several image processing programs and still find photo shop elements virtually essential and wouldn't even think about doing editing without it.\n\nJuly Review:\n\nI have 40 years of slides and negatives to scan and over the last ten years have researched different scanners and tried a few with little satisfaction.  I have also done a few slides commercially but the cost to do the entire collection was prohibitive.  I purchased my first V500 last November and it worked so well that I bought a second one to speed up the process.  I am now about 1/2 the ways through my images and have only 3,000 or so to go.  Although I am sure dedicated scanners are likely better, I can't tell the difference between prints from the V500 scans and commercial prints from the slides so this scanner has certainly met my needs.\n\nA few pointers from what I have learned:  It did not install automatically in Vista and I had to manually load the drivers which was annoying but not a real problem.  As other users have pointed out the bundled Adobe was problematic.  The full version of Adobe though is well worth the money and I am using Adobe 7.0 and there have been no issues with it.  The Digital ICE is fantastic.  Don't even think about scanning without it.  ICE sometimes creates artifacts with Kodachrome but this is easily resolved in Photoshop.  This is a bit time consuming but the quality is worth it. I scanned my first 200 slides without it, both for speed and to avoid the artifacts but there was way too much dust so I rescanned them. As others have pointed out, the included  software sucks.  I only use it when I don't care much about the quality.  Photoshop's smart fix is much better.  I usually only turn on the unsharp mask and grain reduction (both on low) and as mentioned earlier, always use DIGITAL ICE. In my opinion 48-bit color is mandatory if you are going to edit and I use 6400 DPI resolution. I couldn't see any improvement at higher resolutions. I think somewhat lower resolution would be OK for most people especially if they want to post on line, as some sites will not accept this high of a resolution. At these settings, each  image takes about 5 minutes with most of this time for processing.  My computers are Pentium 4's 3.0 Ghz with 3 GIG of RAM.  A faster processor I would expect would work quicker.  As some others have mentioned, the plastic masks are somewhat fragile.  I broke one but a bit superglue made for a good fix.  I had a green line through the images on one scanner for a few scans as mentioned by one of the other reviewers but turning off the scanner and turning it back on resolved this (at least for the last 3 months). Get a good brush to clean the slides.  I use a Staticmaster.  Also keep the glass clean.  I wipe it after every scan with microfiber.;Extremely Satisfied

101;39.0;5.0;15.0;After doing some research on the best low to mid-level priced scanners for use with my Mac, I decided to purchase the Epson Perfection V500 from Amazon. My daughter is working on a project in which she is scanning all of our print photos from our collection of photo albums. I have Adobe Photoshop Elements, but we found that the Epson software for the Mac does a much better automated workflow. She has it set up so she simply puts 3 photos on the scanner and the scanner and software takes it from there. Also, when the price dropped $50 shortly after I purchased the V500, Amazon credited me for the difference - nice price protection!;Best buy for the money!
0;40.0;1.0;15.0;The scanner underperformed to my disappointment. First of all, the scanning area for the transperancy area, which was the main reason I purchased this item was too small. Even if you wanted to scan something in two passes and then paste it, the scanner would not allow you to have anything overhanging from the edges, or it would not scan. Also, it consistantly failed to be recognized after the initial preview scan, so scanning was a very long and frustrating process. I returned it after 2 weeks.;Epson V500

74;47.0;4.0;12.0;"It took me a while to figure out. Once the software is loaded and the scanner is attached via the included USB cable you can click a shortcut on your desktop to read the manual. In order to scan slides and negatives you need to slide the white cover on the lid out and leave the black ""slide"" holder in. At first I couldn't figure out how to use the digital ice, but it is easy in ""Home mode"". Simply click the button for ""Digital ice"". The scans I did were 56 years old, pretty faded and full of artifacts. The program did a nice job. I have not tried photos yet, although it does scan them. I believe that the ""digital ice"" will only work on negative and slide scanning. It is slow to scan, but when you take into account the hours without the ""ice"" cleaning up the dust; scratches and particles found in scans; it is worth it. (you just don't have to do the work) When I scan 4 slides I leave for 10 minutes and come back and they are usually done. It is easy to install and worked great once I read the manual available via shortcut. NOTE: I have Windows XP. The scanner gets 5 stars for performance, but loses a star for slow scans. (at least at 720 dpi with ""ice"".)";Works great on slides
21;48.0;1.0;9.0;"Puhleeeese!\n\nIs there anywhere on the page for the V500 where it says--in BIG LETTERS--Digital Ice Technology IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR PHOTO SCANNING (""Reflective"" v. ""Film"") NOR FOR KODACHROME SLIDES?\n\nAnywhere? If so, I must have missed it. So much for DIT. At least if your scanning anything other than color and B&W negs or ""positives"" (meaning slides) other than Kodachrome. (It finally says in the manual that DIT does not work with Kodachrome...thank you very much, I already bought this thing... $?^/#+@%$$$%@#!!/#...why didn't you say something BEFORE I bought it? Epson? Amazon? Both are to blame.)\n\nActually, DIT does work with Kodachrome, so long as just about zero contrast in your slide. I've tried to post comparative photos here of what happens, at least with Kodachrome, which is the only slide film I ever found acceptable, and therefore the only kind of ""positives"" I have. If visible above (Thus far, they're not visible as Amazon is informing me of a problem and to ""Try again later."" The ""problem"" isn't explained, naturally, but perhaps they'll show up at some point) note what happens to high-contrast edges when DIT is used (top photo) versus when it's turned off (bottom photo). Man, THAT'S UGLY! And touching up that mess is far worse then using no dust removal at all. (By the way, dust removal softens all photos and so isn't advisable if/when you want a sharp photo. The same applies to the Unsharp Mask feature, which should never be used if/when one has another program (such as Photoshop or Lightroom) in which to apply Unsharp Mask as it should be applied. Epson can't do that for you in yet another of its poorly made drivers. However, if you're the most casual of photographers not interested in further processing, go ahead and use it, see what happens; you'll probably get something sharper.)\n\nDIT does remove dust, fine hairs and so on, but at a terrible cost in the case of Kodachrome. The problem pictured (again, if visible here on-line) is probably the reason Epson finally reveals--only on reading the on-line manual after making purchase--that DIT does not work for Kodachrome. Although I'd be curious to know whether the same thing happens when scanning Ektachrome or one of those over-saturated Fuji color slide films.\n\nTrue, the photos posted are very close-up, but visible in any print over 8x10"". You might get away with 4x6"", depending on eyesight. Anyway, I want a sharp scan, not a mess, no matter how close-up short  of, perhaps, pixel level. These photos aren't even close to pixel level.\n\nEqually, or more, irritating is the fact DIT is grayed out altogether when scanning anything other than film, like--just for instance--an old photo you have and really want to clean up. Which would be the best time for and use of DIT! Forget that with the V500, a model of Epson scanner that, though DIT is advertised (claimed to come with the scanner) on the page to purchase the scanner, doesn't really include DIT for most purposes.\n\nThat would mean the specs shown on that page at Amazon for the Epson V500 are a lie, wouldn't it? And what is Epson's game? Claiming something and then not providing it except in certain cases? And with no mention of exceptions?\n\nOne star due to a load of B.S. Otherwise, the V500 is an ordinary scanner, not half as good as the old HP I have but which gave out. True, the HP was more expensive, but at least there was no misleading advertising claiming it could do what it couldn't really do.";Not as advertised

The first was killed by a lightning strike three years ago, the second was a wonderful scanner, an Epson Perfection 4990. I'm doing heavy-duty scanning of my father's negatives from 1921 on. I've been scanning large-format negatives and then hundreds of cans of 35 mm film. I scanned so many with the 4990 I burned out the bulb in the top (it still scans documents, but that's not what I really need it for). Replacing the top (you can't replace just the bulb) would cost nearly $300. (Booo, Epson).\n\nThe way the film used to be returned to the customer was tightly rolled in the original film can, not in nice, flat strips of six. The holder that came with the 4990 was sturdy and supported the negative strip all along.  I have to cut them all to lengths of six exposures, but that's not a problem.\n\nThe old film is tightly curled, so tight that if you let go of one end it snaps back. It's also curled lengthwise. That wasn't a problem with the old holders but it's a nightmare with the new one.\n\nFor some reason  Epson has gone to a different kind of holder  that is thinner plastic and doesn't hold the film along the entire lenth. It takes a real struggle to get the film to stay in the folder and even then the film is so much stronger than the top that is supposed to clamp down and hold it in place that it pops up the center or one end. Pretty tricky getting it into place and the film often ends up skewed.\n\nYes, I've tried using the old holder in the new scanner, but the new scanner can't ""see"" it and thinks there's nothing on the scanner bed.\n\nExcept for this it's a really nice scanner, certainly the same excellent electronics that I've come to expect from Epson. It's faster than my previous scanners, so much faster it almost makes up for the time lost in getting the negatives into place.\n\nTo test I also scanned color documents and a few slides, and they come out fine, right in line with other users' experience.\n\nFor the record I'm scanning with an iMac using OS X 4.11, directly into Photoshop using the Epson TWAIN software. It gives me the most control before I scan. Digital ICE isn't possible to use with black and white negatives because of the silver content of the negatives, so I haven't tested that.\n\nSo, I give the scanner itself five stars, minus one for skimping on an inexpensive piece of plastic. If you're not scanning old 35 mm negatives, the kind that come in cans, I'd recommend this scanner for its small size, light weight, good results.";Good scanner, flimsy negative holder

If you're thinking it's just my computer, it's not.  I've tried this on various computers of different brands and it's always the same thing in the same way.

I have only done some test scans with the V500 and my initial impressions are that it scans quickly (I am using a Vista SP1 desktop w/2GB RAM, an AMD dual core processor, and a Vista performance rating of 5), and my biggest learning curve will be with the software in terms of selecting the optimal scan settings. In brief, there are three modes: home, full auto and professional, with the professional mode offering the most options. One feature that made me choose the V500 (besides the price) was that it comes with digital ICE. So that was one of the first things I tested. My initial results were disappointing. There seemed to be no difference between scans without and with ICE. I got better results by simply manually dusting my negatives with a soft brush, and blowing with a rubber squeeze bulb. I even sent an e-mail to Epson tech support expressing my disappointment, and asked for their help. While waiting for their reply over the course of a few days, I noticed that I had been using my scanner with the USB cable plugged into a hub. I reconnected the scanner by plugging it directly to the computer, and ran my test scans again. Voila! Digital ICE worked this time! It did get rid of dust on a dusty negative, though I would still probably manually dust all slides or negatives before scanning in the future. (When Epson tech support e-mailed back, they said they could not come up with a solution to my problem. I had to tell them that I fixed it by connecting the scanner directly to the computer rather than using the hub.) Don't forget also to clean the scanner glass and the glass in the scanner lid before scanning. This scanner has a maximum optical resolution of 6400 dpi, but I don't know what I would ever scan at that resolution. Epson provides plastic templates to hold and align negatives and slides for scanning. The negatives or slides just have to be placed into the appropriate space. You need to be aware of whether the shiny side of the negative or slide is facing up or down. The software can rotate the image after scanning. The scanning software is ""smart"" in the sense that it will separate the images after scanning whether you are scanning two strips of negatives (6 images per strip) or four slides at a time. The preview window will show each image separately, and each image can be ""tweaked"" separately. Speed was not an issue with my test scans, though I did not scan at higher than 1200 dpi. Scanners don't occupy much shelf space at computer retailers these days, and they don't get much attention lately in the technology news, but for those of use who transitioned from film cameras and who have thousands of prints, negatives and slides still sitting in shoeboxes, albums and binders, scanners cannot be ignored in making the conversion to digital imagery complete.";plug it in, plug it in--directly to your PC
96;54.0;5.0;11.0;"I bought this scanner for my fussy techie brother in law who assumed that any scanner worth it's weight should be in the $8-900 range.  But a salesman at a camera shop told him not to sell the unit short, so he gave me the go-ahead to buy it.  Well, he is happy, enthused, even!  He has been busily transferring his slides/negatives over using the scanner and hasn't a single ""negative"" comment to make about the unit.  Sounds like a bargain to me.";Good scanner
20;55.0;5.0;8.0;So, I personally love film restoration. I love watching documentaries on how they do it, the process, etc. So for some time I've been wanting to get a scanner that was reasonably priced but could deliver the results I was looking for.\n\nLet's get one thing straight - if your photo sucks, it sucks. This scanner won't make some ill focused, poorly lit, severely damaged photo look like high art. I get the feeling some people are expecting that out of this scanner. Also, keep in mind, film negatives will be extremely grainy - that is how chemical film works - so don't expect a smooth glossy image.\n\nI've gotten some amazing results with the scans from the original negatives. Details that have been lost or haven't been seen in years. Patterns on the wallpaper, writing on paper pinned to the fridge, individual strands of loose hair. Also you get a bigger picture from scanning the original negative than you do by scanning in the 4x6 print as the 4x6 print is actually a cropped down photo from the original negative.\n\nI can't think of a single reason to not use Digital ICE on every scan. Of course it makes the scanning process longer, but when it cleans up scratches, scuffs, bends, dust - you'd never know. Some damage is irreversible. I had a few negatives with water damage that scanned in, but the area of water damage had become quite garbled - nothing the scanner can do on that end.\n\nOther features like Color Restoration, Grain Reduction, Unsharp Mask, and Backlight Correction should be used on an As-Needed-Basis - not for every photo. Color restoration should be used on photos that are either hued too blue or too orange/yellow and only on those occasions. Backlight Correction, when desperately needed, should be used Grain Reduction set to High - the photo won't be flawless but your results will be MUCH better.\n\nI got this scanner 5 days ago and I have scanned in over 200 strips of negative film since then - all the while doing other things on my computer (playing graphic intensive video games, watching Netflix, Facebook'ing etc.) and it did not affect the processing time of the scanner nor did the scanner slow down my system one bit.\n\nIf you are looking for an affordable way to digitize your family photos from the original negatives and see them in a way you've never seen them before - this is definitely the scanner for you.\n\nOn added note, one hour photos - there is no point on scanning at a higher DPI. When film is rushed to develop in under an hour you lose a ton of quality. Did you take your family photos on a disposal camera? Again, no need for a ridiculously high DPI. I've scanned in most of my family photos at 2400 DPI and got a good enough quality to print on a 13in x 19in print.;Excellent scanner for digitizing old family negatives.
56;56.0;4.0;10.0;I just received the V500 and followed the simple instructions to get it hooked up with the appropriate software.  I started scanning old photos and got spectacular results.  I used the Professional Mode.  The photos were all 30 years old and many of the nature shots had deteriorated to photos with a terrible red cast to them.  I assumed they were useless.  The V500 software turned these old faded and red photos into beautiful pictures again.  I was amazed.  I used scratch/dust removing, unmasking, and color restoration processes.  I scanned the photos at 400 dpi.  Occasionally, on photos with people in them I adjusted the colors a little more (which is easy to do).  I tested 200, 400, 600, and 1200 dpi and found that anything over 400 dpi on the photos was superfluous.  With the above processes running and at 400 dpi the 3x5 and 4x6 photos were taking 15 to 20 seconds to scan.  I did over 300 photos at one sitting.  The results, again, were astounding.;Epson V500 Review

87;58.0;5.0;10.0;I had a Visioneer scanner, and was frustrated with it, because I had a lot to scan that would not fit within its scan window.  Then, my husband drug out a huge pile of medium format negatives, and I knew the Visioneer would not do the job.  I read about the Epson Perfection in Consumer Report, and went for it.  I am really glad I did!  It was easy to set up, intuitive to use and you can arrange your material most any way you want on the glass.  You are not limited to Epson's very helpful templates.  You can scan a strip of negatives, and just highlight the one you want to work with. I used the digital ICE technology on a few of the medium format negs, they are black and white, and was not really happy with the result, however, I may not know the proper way to utilize it.  The backlight correction is awesome, and there is a feature in which I can adjust the backlight through brightness and contrast myself.  So far, I have scanned color slides, 35mm negative strips in color, medium format negatives in black and white, documents and color photos.  I am not a professional, but Epson makes me look like one!  This would be especially good for scrapbookers, and altered art makers, and most especially for people like me who want to preserve old photos and negs before they return to the earth!!  Thanks Epson, I am 100% pleased!!;AN AWESOME SCANNER
43;59.0;5.0;9.0;I purchased the Epson v500 Photo scanner around 3/28/09. I have scanned documents and 35mm slides with the device and have found it satisfactory.\nThe setup and installation was very simple for the scanner and Adobe OEM Photoshop.  I used the Epson Scan software for both photo and slides.  For simple photo scanning, the use is very simple.  I used the provessional options associated with the software and they worked very well, although I did most of the editing in Photoshop.  So far all is very simple.\nUsing the Adobe Photoshop, editor and Adobe Premier elements took longer to learn, but within a month of delivery I was satisfied with the scanning I did on 500 slides and 50 photgraphs and the ability to join my vhs movies with photos/slides to produce a two hour movie of the combination.  Some people have commented that slide scanning took a long time: I used the 2400 resolution scan on slides and it took 6 minutes for four slides.  With highest resolution it took 20 minutes,  but the size of the  each slide resulted in hundreds of millions byts of storage.  Too much for what I wanted - so I didn't use the max resolution.  After a month I am very happy with the results.;Adobe software and scanner are great

(When you set it up, follow the directions closely, and don't forget to slide the locks on both the inside and and back of the unit.)\n\nThe scanner does include Optical Character Recognition software, but it is not incorporated into the scanning screen, so it took me a while to find it.

65;61.0;5.0;9.0;"My main reason for buying this scanner was for the 1,200+ slides taken during our chilhood.  I also tried the Canon 8800F scanner. From my trial scans, the digital ICE for the V500 did a much better job of cleaning up scratches than Canon's software.  My computer skills are rather limited, but I was able to set this up and scan in just a few minutes; actually, I've used it both on a PC and a Mac.  I'm scanning the slides at 4800 dpi in the home mode using digital ICE on all slides and color restoration on most.  It takes about 12 minutes to scan 4 slides under these conditions.  With this resolution the file size is 13-14 MB saved in JPG with a compression factor of 2. TIFF file size would be 70-100MB.  I have also scanned some photographs dating back as far as 1920 and am very pleased with the results.  I'm very happy with this scanner.";Epson V500 scanner
28;62.0;3.0;8.0;"I was seduced by the promises:\n\n- Create crystal-clear photo enlargements and scan slides, negatives, and medium-format film\n- Easy Photo Fix quickly restores faded photos with one touch\n- Digital Ice technology removes dust particles and scratches from images\n\nI have tons of old family photos and slides I wanted to scan. I got the scanner a few days ago and set it up. The scanner looks attractive and stylish, though it takes up much more desk space that my old Canon scanner did. My first big disappointment is that there is no User's Manual provided. I'm one of those sorts who loves to read User's Manuals from cover to cover and learn all I can as soon as I can, to see what's possible. But the ""User's Manual"" is just an online html document with lots of hyperlinks. Which for me is basically impossible to use. My brain and learning style are just not compatible with this, plus I was hoping to use the scanner this summer at a place where I will have no internet access for a few weeks. Suppose I wanted to refer to the manual?\n\nI even went to the Epson website to see if there was a downloadable User's Guide. I figured even if they were too chintzy to include a manual they might still supply a PDF which I could print. But no such luck. There is no User's Guide available even in PDF format.\n\nSo I am really struggling in trying to use it. Maybe my problems are because I can't figure out what to do - but I am really disappointed in my scanned images. Many of my slides/photos are old, faded, dusty, scratched, etc. I thought all the great software features might help restore them - but so far they have been USELESS.\n\nI mean when I set my scan options I choose Color Restoration, Digital ICE, Dust Removal - yet the scanned images still come out dusty, faded and covered with various artifacts. I scanned one very faded and scratched slide twice, once with no options, and once with both Color Restoration and Digital ICE selected. The two scans both came out virtually identical - both faded and scratched just like the original slide.\n\nIt does seem to work and the images are crisp. I downloaded the Windows 7 software and have had no problems so far, but it's fair to say I'm very underwhelmed with the image restoration software. I see hours of Photoshopping in my future that I was hoping this scanner might help me avoid,";Disappointing results
71;63.0;4.0;9.0;I have now had the Epson V500 scanner for 2 weeks.  I have scanned about 750 35mm slides, color negs and B&W negs and also 6x7 medium format color negs.  The results are very good. For a $175 scanner I would say the results are outstanding.  Other customers who are complaining about the scanner seem to have too little RAM memory to properly operate this scanner.  It takes me about 4-6 min. to scan 4 35mm slides at 4000ppi, 48 bit and 100% scale using only the normal dust removal and not the digital ICE. The ICE is great for some slides and not so great for others and a disaster for B&W negs.  However the normal dust removal option is good.  This is a very simple scanner to operate, in fact, I don't see how it could be simpler.\n  I am very happy with this scanner.;Quick and simple

Called Epson...little help...they sent me a new power supply....no help.  I had to mail the unit to a service center (at my expense).  2 months later I got it back.  By then the fever of scanning had passed and I was putting in a backyard or something.  So, this winter I got a hankering to start scanning again.  Just scanned about 200 slides for the folks' 60th....when it died...again....same thing....this sucks.  I will not fix it...I will buy something else that isn't Epson.\n\nThe slides and negs that I did scan turned out OK after I got the hang of it.  Too bad the unit doesn't hold up.

59;68.0;5.0;8.0;I have used this scanner to scan in my grandmothers photos.  These were photos she has collected over the past 80 years and they came in types of prints.  A wide range of color and black & white film size, shape, quality and type, even pollards. Some images were so faded you could hardly see the colors.  I have scanned in a total of 1600 photos.  I used the auto settings (increasing the dpi for more important images) and turned on the color correction filter for the older faded images.  They all scanned in marvelously in fact most of the old faded images scanned in much crisper and vivid than the original photo.  I did find if you try to use the color correction filter on the photos that don't need color correction the color will be distorted and bad so only use the filter when you need it.  I had scanned my photo albums in using another Cannon scanner (I paid a lot more for than this one) a couple of years ago and I am much happier with this scanner.

Epson customer service offers no assistance with this and their basic response is to contact Adobe to BUY an upgrade.  Not a satisfactory response in my opinion.  If the Photoshop program is a big incentive for you to buy this scanner then you should be aware of this.  Epson will not tell you or offer any help.;Be Careful
17;71.0;4.0;6.0;"The following comments were written after I scanned in 3000 photos, some slides and one film strip.  My project involves scanning old family photos, slides and negatives.  My old scanner couldn't do the slides and took a really long time on the photos.  One of the time hogs was scanning groups of photos and having to make multiple copies, then crop the individual ones out in a photo editor.\n\nThe good:\n\n1. over three times faster than my old scanner for color photos\n2. scans multiple photos to individual files.  This works really well.\n3. fast prescan\n\nThe bad (mostly minor annoyances):\n\n1. grayscale (b&w) photo scanning speed is about the same as my old scanner.\n2. after you define a new folder in the file save Browse window, simply pressing OK creates an error message about permissions when you try to scan.  In order for it to work, after you type in the new file name, you need to click anywhere in the window, then press OK.\n\nOnce you spend some time trying the various settings, it's easy to get into a rythm.  I found that although the scanner is relatively fast, I had time to edit the pictures with an external editor, in my case the excellent and fast Windows Live Photo Gallery, while the next frame is scanning.  This keeps you busy so no time is wasted.  Although I tried the Thumbnail mode on loose photos (spaced at least 0.8"" apart), the photo finder algorithm included the white borders so I had to crop the pictures manually anyway.  If your pictures are borderless, you should be ok.  Because of that, I opted to use the normal mode on full pages of mounted photos, selecting the crop areas manually in the prescan image.  This was much faster and I didn't have to unmount the photos.  The prescan image was shown in a medium size window on my 1920 x 1080 screen and couldn't be enlarged to allow more accurate selection of the individual photos.  You can zoom into the images one at a time but the use of an larger prescan window would be must faster.  The response of the scanner can lag a bit during the selection process; sometimes I had to wait a few seconds to get my cursor back.  My computer is has an i7 quad processor with a memory of 8 gigs so I doubt it is the computer's fault.  The ability to name files with a prefix and dash number on the fly saved a lot of time.  There are tons of image editing adjustments which worked well but for me, the necessary settings varied so much between scans that I decided to do them afterward with a photo editor.  That proved to be faster.  I scanned a few slides with excellent results except for the borders; although the slides fit well into the slide holder, the actual image area of my slides varied considerably and again, I was forced to crop many images in an external photo editor.  Can't a good algorithm be designed to find the edges?  My film strip scan was an old 110 color negative film and there was no way to mount it in the film holder which seemes to be designed for 35mm film.  The holder locates the film in the scan area so I placed the film in that space, letting it bow up a bit since there was no way to keep it flat.  With a little help from my photo editor, after the images were massaged and colors corrected, the results were surprising!  Not great, but quite good given the conditions.  Although my computer has both USB2 and 3 connections, they were both about the same speed with the scanner, although file transfer speed was not a problem for me.  A tad faster would be helpful.\n\nOverall, it's a great scanner and I would recommend it if you have a big scanning project.";Epson V500 Photo Scanner
29;72.0;1.0;7.0;I bought this scanner based on the reviews it had.  Pretty much everyone had excellent scan results.  But maybe my expectations are too high because I spent hours messing around with the settings to get the quality right for my slides.  Every single attempt resulted in unsharp images.  My slides are tack sharp... but just to give the benefit of the doubt I scanned some film that I already had scanned before from my lab.  The comparison was pitiful.  This scanner just falls short of the quality of paying a lab to do the scanning.  I even went as high as 9600 dpi and all I ended up with was a crappy image that wanted so badly to crash my computer because of it's shear size.  I am boxing it up today and returning it on my way to my lab so that they can give me what I was hoping to get from this scanner.;Lousy results
23;73.0;4.0;6.0;I still shoot film, so I need a scanner that will do a great job scanning negatives and won't break the bank. So far, the Epson v500 is making me very happy. It's very easy to set-up, BUT I wish the included instructions were more comprehensive. I spent about 30 minutes trying to figure out why the machine would not scan my negatives as film when I placed the negative carrier on the scanning bed. Instead, I was getting a scanned image of the negative carrier! Very frustrating. After spending about 10 minutes Googling, I finally found my answer. Apparently, you need to REMOVE the white reflector underneath the top cover, which is not mentioned in the instruction guide. After this is removed, the scanner automatically detects the negative holder and begins scanning the negatives as film rather than a photo. The reflector easily slides out by pulling on a tab located near the top edge of the cover.\n\nBefore settling on the v500, I had looked at the v600 and the Canon 9000F, but chose the V500 for the affordable price and mostly positive reviews. Plus, I didn't really see a difference between the V600 and the V500 except, I think, V600 has the ability to scan bigger negatives, which is not necessary for me. I decided against Canon because of the cost and the fact that Epson has a better reputation for scanners. The scan quality is great and any adjustments can easily be done in Photoshop. Now, if you're comparing the V500 to a V700 then you need to stop because the V700 costs significantly more, so the scanned images should be significantly better. But, if you're looking for an affordable scanner that produces impressive results, the V500 is a great option.\n\nI don't have any issues with the negative carrier like others do. It holds the film and does a fine job when placed in the machine. Yes, it's a bit flimsy, but nothing to complain about. The software is a no brainer. Just download it onto your system (I use an iMac) and you're ready to go. There are several scanning modes and I always have it set at Professional in order to access advanced menus.\n\nOverall, I'm very satisfied with this machine and plan to keep it around for a long time.;Affordable Quality Scanner for Negatives, but Lousy Instructions

I use a Mac Pro with OSX Leopard (10.5.7).\n\nI used to be the editor of a small tabloid magazine, so we did a ton of scanning for ads and for the articles, too. This was in 1995. Back then we used a scanner that was pulblishing quality, and it worked well, if a bit slowly. It cost $1700 at the time.\n\nNow I buy the Epson V500 for my home, for under $200 and it is WAY better than the one we used long ago. It wouldn't work for a big publishing firm, because it doesn't scan a superwide area, and it isn't perfect in color reproduction, but for an intermediate user who owns Photoshop, or some other editing app, or for somebody working at a small publication that needs lots of scanning, but not ""Time"" magazine crispness nor color, you will be delighted.\n\nThis scanner is fast. Warms up very quickly, previews quickly, scans from the front panel or from within an application using the Twain drivers, and gives excellent output.

I've spent most of my time in Home Mode which gives you some basic options on what you are scanning, the resolution, brightness, color correction, ICE, etc. 4800 dpi is huge: it will create a file that is 4800 x 7200 pixels, which is over 34 MP. I scanned most of the scans at 1200 dpi, which produced about a 2MP file on 35mm negative.\nWhen you are scanning 35mm negatives or slides, if you press ""thumbnail"" option, the scanner will detect and segment all the photos into different files after you run the preview scan. You also can rotate photos in the preview, so you don't need to do any post processing. The segmentation and rotations only work for 35mm, not medium format.\nIn home mode, ICE, color correction, brightness, contrast, and backlight correction are all possible adjustments before you even scan, after you scan the preview. This is a good option to have, depending on your negative.\n\nScan times:\nScanning is very quick at 300 dpi, which is a screen quality size. Scan times do go up from there. Most scans at 1200 dpi seemed to take about 1-2 minutes. 4800 DPI takes about 5 minutes.\n\nDigital ICE:\nAdding ""Digital ICE"" option will add to the scan time. The results are good for old negatives, but it didn't seem to make too much difference with new negatives as long as you blow the dust and cat hair off the negatives (a can of compressed air works well). A negative with too much damage will actually look worse with ICE.  A 1200 DPI scan with ICE takes about 12 minutes.\n\nKodachrome\nKodachrome has a reputation of scanning poorly, and the scanner's performance on KR was important to me. The good news is that it works very well. From what I read, I don't think ICE works, but since Kodachrome holds up so well, then you don't need ICE.\n\nExtras:\nThe scanner came with Adobe Elements 6. I literally can't tell the difference between Elements 6 and the current offering, Elements 7. Elements  has all the tools a home user will need: color correction, brightness & contrast corrections, fixing spot marks.\n\nThe Downside:\nAs other people have mentioned, the negative trays are a little flimsy, but as long as you are careful, they'll be okay.\nIf you are scanning medium format, there isn't a thumbnail preview. You have to do it one at a time, and may have to rotate the photo after scanning.\nScan times, including the time switch out the negatives or slides, can be higher, but I think to increase scanning times, with autofeeders, you will be spending 5 times as much.  Normally I am doing something else while scanning, so it's\nIf you unplug the scanner from the computer after using it and you plug it back in, the computer may not recognize the scanner. If you restart your computer and scanner, it will fix the problem.";Great Value
58;76.0;4.0;7.0;I got the Epson V500 Photo today, and within 30 minutes, I had it up and scanning.  As far as I can tell, there are no problems with the set-up, the interface with my Mac, the Epson software, or the quality of the scans. The construction requires the lid to be unplugged to take it off for scanning anything that's extremely thick, but other than that, the scanner's perfect. I was a little nervous about the purchase, having read about problems other users (particularly Mac users) had encountered with Epson scanners, but so far, I'm very pleased with mine.;Epson V500 Scanner--works for me!
64;77.0;5.0;7.0;"After getting a headache with an HP scanner that we bought, returned, we ended up shopping once again for a scanner that would handle the photos, slides and negatives that I have.\n\nThis is the scanner.  Honest.  It was easy to load, and I was working with the scanner within a half hour testing the basic full scan mode, which I love.  I started reading other reviews after we bought this scanner and kept it in mind when I was going to start all of my projects.\n\nI will be savings LOTS and LOTS of money by doing my own scanning with this Epson scanner.  I was taking my negatives into a professional lab to have put on CD - now I can do that myself.  I don't need to use any of the advanced features as I like to use Photoshop Elements to correct any flaws, coloring, scratches.\n\nIt honestly did not take that long to scan from the negatives and/or slides.  I wish you could scan more than 4 slides at a time, but that is fine.  I like how you can just ""drop"" in the slides into the holder and then just pick up from the sides - never having to touch the glass or the slide itself.  The negative holder could have been done a little better, but it is very doable.\n\nThe scans themselves are really good and decent.  When I fixed my first photo from a negative scan it was unbelievable.  I had to fix the normal dust and scratch marks in Elements, but it didn't really take that long and I enjoy working with that program.\n\nAm I happy customer - YES, very happy!!!!!!  I am an amateur photographer who loves taking pictures - thousands every year and this scanner will become one of my favorite pieces of computer equipment to be using as I still have thousands of negatives and hundreds of slides that I want to scan in...I think I will be kept busy for a while.\n\nThe only other thing that I didn't like is that each time you want to do a new scan you have to go back into the scan program instead of it just waiting for the next scan - which I can live with.  I like how you can change settings for each individual scan also if you would like.\n\nA+++++ all the way for me on this scanner.  HP could look at this scanner and improve on theirs - and I used to be a dedicated HP computer person.....";I like it - I like it
13;78.0;3.0;5.0;After reading the reviews here I expected great things.  I have a mac that I just updated to 10.6.8.  The installation was a cinch.  The document scan was perfect, but after a couple of hours with Epson tech support over the phone, we could not get it to scan a negative or slide, even after troubleshooting everything possible on that computer.  Since my main reason for purchasing this product was to scan negatives and slides on that computer, and because I already have a good document scanner,  I decided to return it.  That said, I have to put in a good word for EPSON TECH SUPPORT.  They were polite, patient, knowledgeable.  I would buy another Epson product, or even try another Perfection v500 photo scanner at another time.  To its credit, Amazon fulfilled my order with lightening speed and made the return easy.;Disappointed
14;79.0;3.0;5.0;"I purchased this scanner after much research in December 2011, trying to find a replacement for a beloved CanoScan LIDE500 that no longer worked with my Mac once I'd upgraded to Lion (OS 10.7). I knew that I could use Image Capture or Import from Scanner to make a scan using my old machine and Preview or Acrobat, but this is a cumbersome process, and I often need to quickly scan a chapter from a library book, which is laborious work if the scanning process is slow.\n\nI discovered that the Epson Perfection V500 Photo Scanner did not work with Lion. That is, I can go through the same cumbersome process, with the exception that Acrobat won't even recognize the scanner. After some work, I managed to get Preview to recognize the scanner, but working with it is not easy; for one thing, it keeps switching the field to a narrow band across the middle of the page, despite many efforts to fix this.\n\ni've spent hours on the phone with Epson support, which sounds like it's in India. They were not particularly helpful and there was apparently no way of even getting an email notification once the 10.7 driver came out.\n\nI just checked again today and FINALLY the new driver is out. I am hoping it will work. If not, perhaps at least this review will be helpful to others having problems.\n\nMoreover, one major reason I spent the money on this scanner is because it is bundled with ABBYY FineReader, or a version of it (ABBYY FineReader SprintPlus OCR). I can't access that program, because the CD is unhelpfully set up as an installer, meaning that it refuses to run because of my OS. The version of ABBYY FineReader on the CD might be perfectly compatible with my computer, but I can't get to it to find out.\n\nFinally, the scanner is heavy and clunky. It comes with three different cords and takes up too much room on my desk. Boy, do I miss my nice little nearly-portable Canon.";"Slow to work with Mac Lion (OS 10.7); support not very helpful"
89;80.0;5.0;7.0;I upgraded from an Epson v350 so that I could scan large format negatives.  I love this machine.  It is fast, quiet, and accurate.  I only wish it did more than 4 slides at a time, but that is my only negative note.\n\n2011 UPDATE:  I still love this scanner.  It is fantastic.\n\n2013 UPDATE:  No changes.  Absolutely wonderful scanner.  Buy it!\n\n2015 UPDATE:  Still going strong and still love it!;Impressive Machine
15;81.0;5.0;5.0;"Epson takes their photography products very seriously, and this scanner is no exception. Epson has a full line of Perfection scanners. This model (V500) is somewhere in the middle between casual amateur and hardcore professional.\n\nI was searching for a slide-and-negative scanner, and had it narrowed down to the Wolverine F2D14 and this one. Both were good deals on Amazon, and both got high ratings from tech-savvy users. I was intrigued with the idea of buying a high-capacity SD card for the Wolverine, and sitting on the couch in my living room to scan a stack of slides. But I got the Epson instead.\n\nDON'T LET THE PICTURE OF IT ON THIS PAGE FOOL YOU! From the picture, I thought this was a compact scanner, big enough for 4 slides, a strip of 4 negatives, or a 4x6 (or 5x7) photo. Wrong. This is a full-sized flatbed scanner. It will handle photos up to size A4. The picture on this page doesn't show the full 18-inch length. This thing sits on a desk or table, not in your lap.\n\nI was worried that the film-scanning capability would be a compromise, in spite of the many positive reviews. After all, this is a true flat-bed scanner, while the Wolverine is essentially a 14 MP camera with backlighting. Not to worry: the Epson has a second light source (backlighting) for slides and negs, and resolution goes all the way up to 12,800 dpi.  That's roughly the equivalent of scanning a 4x6 print at 3200 dpi, or an 8.5 x 11 page at 1600 dpi.\n\nThe scanning procedure is simple, and the results are excellent. The Epson Scan program works great. Skip the ""easy"" modes and go straight to Professional mode. Don't be afraid of it. You don't need to install Photoshop Elements if you have another program that works for you. (I recommend Paint. NET. It's free, and much easier to use than the GIMP.)\n\nA short list of things I don't like:\n- The film frame feels flimsy. I'm waiting for one or more tabs to break on the clip that holds the negatives in place.\n- Things don't happen instantaneously. The scanner's CPU seems to spend a lot of time thinking, even when it's not processing an image. Cutting out a lot of this processing overhead would cut scan times almost in half.\n- I'd like to see a 110 film adapter for the film frame. I have an archive of 110 negatives that I want to scan in. One user mentioned using PostIt Notes on the glass platen for a makeshift frame. I'll try that, but I wish I had something more permanent.";The right choice, and then some

32;83.0;3.0;6.0;"I purchased this scanner from the Epson store specifically to scan several hundred 6x4.5 color transparancies (very few other scanners have this capability).  I am using it with a Mac Pro (latest Intel chip) running OS 10.6.2 Snow Leopard.\n\nAfter 50 or so scans, my computer quit recognizing the scanner.  Uninstalling and reinstalling the software did not solve the problem.  Nothing on the Epson web site fully addressed my problem.  I contacted Epson customer support and after trying a couple of software reconfiguration tricks, I was informed that there was a hardware problem with my scanner and Epson offered to replace it with overnight shipping to boot.  Received the replacement scanner the following afternoon.  They also provided me with free shipping to return the defective machine.  So I give Epson extremely high marks for customer service.\n\nWhile the new scanner works very well, I can not say the same for their Epson Scan software.  The software is not entirely  intuitive to use although one can learn to use it.  (In other words, its ""not Mac like"".  The biggest problem is that the Epson Scan software is not stable with Snow Leopard.  Although I get good to great scans, I can only scan one or two images and the software freezes.  This is despite having installed the most recent driver from the Epson web site.  Having to consistently force quit and restart the software greatly slows down the progress on my project and is annoying as well.\n\nEpson provides a plastic slide holder to correctly position transparancies.  Although the slide holder does not seem particularly sturdy, with care, it can be used without breaking.  My problem with the holder for strips of 6x4.5  transparancies is that one can only scan two transparancies because the aperture is so small.  Since it appears that the scanner could scan up to 4  transparancies with a larger aperture, this small aperture is troubling and slows down my project.\n\nFor a while, I could not get Epson Scan to even complete booting.  After a conversation with very capable and helpful technical support, we did a new ""hard install"" and this solved the booting problem although Epson Scan continues to freeze.\n\nSo although I rate Epson customer an technical support very highly, the software needs considerable help to run well with Snow Leopard.  If the software ran well consistently, I would rate the scanner highly as it gives very good results and is one of the few scanners which will scan 6x4.5 transparancies.";Great Scanner/Customer Service - Sucky Software
34;84.0;5.0;6.0;Faced with the task of scanning slides, prints, and negatives I researched and bought my first scanner.  As the bulk were slides and negatives I picked the V500 because of the Digital Ice feature.  However, based upon scan times I doubt I'll use Digital Ice.  I'm still impressed with the product, which came with Photoshop Elements 6, which by itself is a great product.\n\nSince I'm new to this I tried to educate myself.  The website [...] is a great place to visit.  His printing / scanning calculator is a great tool.\n\nThe first thing I did was scan a small number of prints, negatives, and slides at various resolutions to get timings and file sizes.  Then I made some prints to see what the results looked like before I started scanning in earnest.  Here are the results:\n\nSCANNING:\nScanning times will depend upon the power of your computer.  The Epson scan driver uses a lot of CPU when it is running.  My times are with a 2.80Ghz Celeron.\n\nYou can scan directly into Photoshop Elements after the Epson software has scanned it and done any desired corrections.  However, I didn't see the need as Photoshop Elements takes a long time to load. I just saved the scans and will use Photoshop Elements as a separate step.\n\nPrints: Only scanned 4x6 prints at 300 dpi, with and without software dust removal.  Per print scan averages: 20 seconds without dust removal, 24 seconds with dust removal.  File sizes were about 260KB.  NOTE: the v500 will only scan three 4x6 photos at a time.  You can fit four on the glass, but there isn't enough separation for each to be individually recognized.\n\n35mm Slides: Scanned at 600, 1200, 1600, and 2400 dpi, with and without Digital Ice. Digital Ice, while doing a good job, takes forever.  At 1200 dpi a single slide scan takes 136 seconds with DI, vs. 40 seconds without DI.  Per slide scan averages, without DI, for 600, 1200, 1600, and 2400 dpi were 24, 40, 51, and 87 seconds.  File sizes were 84, 296, 506, and 1,082 KB.\n\n35mm Negatives: Scanned at 600, 1200, 1600, and 2400 dpi without Digital Ice.  Per negative scan averages were 23, 35, 45, and 75 seconds.  File sizes were 148, 438, 708, and 1,309 KB.\n\nRESULTANT PRINTS:\nPrints: Dust removal did a decent job.  4x6 prints looked as good as the originals.\n\n35mm Slides: I made 5x7  prints of the 1600 and 2400 dpi scans. [...] indicates that 1600 dpi is sufficient for 5x7 prints and 2400 dpi is almost sufficient for 8x10.  Since these are primarily snapshots I decided that 1600 dpi was as good as I needed.  If I was going to make 8x10s I'd scan at 3200 dpi. I could tell no difference between the prints made from 1600 or 2400 dpi scans.\n\n35mm Negatives: Again 5x7 prints of the 1600 and 2400 dpi scans.  Again, no discernible difference in the resultant prints.\n\nI haven't tried to scan documents or to convert a scanned document to text.\n\nAll in all I'm very pleased with the product.  I'm only just now realizing how much time it is going to take to scan my collection.;Does what I want - statistics
22;85.0;1.0;5.0;With the included software, this scanner is almost useless. Regardless of how you set the clunky driver software, the scans come out so fuzzy you'll think it's out of focus or smothered in vaseline. The bottom of the scan glass is cloudy as the head passes over it.\n\nOddly if you use VueScan, you'll find that the scans are far sharper -- not great, but far sharper, even without an unsharp mask / sharpening applied.\n\nThe scanner is extremely fast and the physical body is well designed. Using the multiple page PDF option requires clicking two buttons on the software, not the body of the scanner, for each additional page (why not one button? why not a button on the scanner body?).\n\nYou can save your settings but you can't assign a name to the saved settings.\n\nThe Mac software is PPC based so it won't work in Leopard. A very limited subset of features is available via Image Capture and that appears to be Epson's sole solution.\n\nCanon's looking very attractive. I bought this based on other reviews at Amazon and wish I'd returned it earlier.;A huge disappointment

I was happy with the processing time of the slide scanning, as well as the quality. After about 750 slides, the unit just died. No power, no reason. I was just a little disappointed with that. Hopefully when I get this fixed or replaced, the next run time will be longer. I shrug it off as a fluke unit.;Nice product, not long lived
57;88.0;5.0;6.0;"I finally got a chance to plug this in and try it out with a bunch of slides from 20 - 30 years ago.\nThe unit was fast to set up, and easy to operate.  People have commented on how fast/slow it is, but it's all in what you want out of the reproduction in regards to DPI, and other color enhancements you want the scanner to take care of.\n  I've been scanning all day at 1200 DPI, and utilizing all the Epson color correction options.  It isn't fast, about 10 minutes per 4 slides, but the results are absolutely perfect IMO.  Well worth the wait.\n  The Epson was designed with quality reproduction foremost, not production speed, and is perfect for doing the boxes of slides laying around the house as you have time.\n  It's very quiet, and I do the slides as I'm busy doing other chores on the computer.  It doesn't take much CPU time and doesn't interfere with other ongoing software.\n  I would advice taking a portable slide viewer to preview and orient the slides before placing them on the Epson, delete the ones you don't want, and wear nitrile, or dust free cotton gloves when handling the slides and removing them from the platen.\n  We have since scanned all our important 4x6 photo's using the Epson, and with a normal (suggested) setting of 300 DPI, the Epson is very fast, about 5 seconds per photo.  (you can select other DPI's) The quality is excellent.\n  I should note that although the standard file format the Epson uses is JPG, you can also select TIFF, which allows you to use photographic software to manipulate the photo afterwards.\n  I advise using the Professional Mode, as it allows you to set all the important parameters, do a preview to see how it looks, and especially with photo's, set the orientation size, as this is the most important setting for speed and scan time.  Some photo's will want to be scanned on their 4"" side, other on their 6"" side.  Once you have the settings made and verified, simply press the button on the front of the scanner, switch the photo's and go.  Very fast!\n\n  This unit is well worth the investment, and will solve the problem of restoring memories on older media into digital format.\nI would strongly recommend the Epson slide scanner to anyone.\n\nRegards,\nRobert Krueger\nRochester, NY";Fantastic reproductive quality!

I used Epson scan and the included Adobe Photoshop 4.0.  Photoshop is up to 6.0 now but what can you say for a free add on program?  I needed to go on line to the epson site and the Adobe site to get detailed instructions for operations.  The only written instructions that came with the equipment were limited to where to plug which cord into which socket.  I scanned 3 35mm color negatives at 6400 dpi with 48 dpi color with 768x1024 screen size and backlight corrections and ICE and it took 15 minutes or 5 minutes per negative  That is about as detailed as one can go and so this is the maximum scanning time for those settings. I haven't tried the auto function but I am sure it will be faster but I like the detail that comes with the 6400 dpi imiges.  The individual files for these scans were 4.7 to 6.7 MB after working with them in Photoshop.  I am very pleased.  I have about 1-2000 slides to digitize so I will be working at it for quite some time but I am very pleased with the equipment and software.  It will take some time to get used to but I have time.

I needed to produce a video slide show for a birthday party and most of the photos were 40yrs old and older.

I was even able to scan 40 yr old 110 negatives that had become a bit wrinkled.  I was also able to scan my wedding 4x5 negatives to very impressive resolutions.  The software works well, used the professional mode for the film and negatives but the auto mode worked fine for slides and photos.;Works great!

36;95.0;4.0;5.0;"I looked through many of the reviews here before buying. I don't have anything to say that others have not said, but here are the most important things to me.\n\n1) Customer service is friendly but incompetent.  There are a couple of features in the software that are not intuitive and one small feature that simply does not work.  These people seem to lack a good data base of problems and solutions.  They were willing to spend as much time as it took, but in the end they were not helpful.\n\n2) The scanning software is VERY powerful and pretty easy to use.  The documentation for it is sketchy and poorly organized; but that is more than balanced by its ease of use once you've spent an hour or so with it.\n\n3) Digital ICE has been around for a while now.  This hardware-based dust cleaning feature works only for slides and film, not for prints. But it works flawlessly.  (There is a software-based dust-cleaning solution for prints: it seems to work fine, too.)\n\n4) One of the handiest features, if you're doing a lot of photos, is the fact that you can lay several (3 - 4x6 or 5 3x5) photos on the scanner at once.  When the scanner previews in thumbnail mode, it finds all the photos and treats them as separate images.  This can save vast amounts of time.\n\nI personally found the weak customer support and the quirky documentation more of an annoyance than a real negative.  But this is a semi-professional scanner, and if you're not a little bit skilled, you might end up feeling a lot lost.";Great scanner at a great price

In all cases I can not complain about the quality and speed (I always want it faster, but hey, you can not have everything).\n\nHowever, the Epson Scan software, while not too hard to use, is sometimes unhandy to use, and has a few, not fatal bugs.\n1. you can not save your preferred settings with your own meaningful name, it forces you to use names like 'setting 1', setting 2. etc. which is not helpful when you want to use that one special setting a month or two later.\n2. when scanning slides it always trys to apply color correction, regardless if you reload your preferred settings where you tried to turn it off.\n3. when scanning multiple slides, and you want to turn on a correction for all the slides, you have to be sure to both select them all, and be sure a check box underneith is checked for it to work across all.  I still am not sure when selecting (you get a blue box around the picture) or using the check box under the picture should be used for what..\n\nNow all this would be OK, if Epson would listen to the many people who point these errors out, and update the software, but I have learned, from this and from my attempts to get support, that once they have sold you the thing, they really do not want to listen to you any more.\n\nWhen I scan slides and negatives, I get a very light strip about 1mm wide.  I have used Epsons etalk chat program, and after having 2 chats just ended in the middle of the conversation, I finally was told to email a sample.  I did this, and after 2 weeks, 5 reminders and two times being ignored via the etalk tool, I have had no response what so ever, not even a message they they got my email.\n\nSo be warned, be sure your supplier will back you up 100% because Epson themselves will completely ignore you and any problems... pretty dumb in these crisis time...;Good scanner, poor software and support
49;99.0;5.0;5.0;I ordered this for a friend who has hundreds if not thousands of pictures he's taken over time and he wanted a way to preserve those photos because a lot of them were fading in color. I suggested he make a digital library of those photos so that he will always have a copy. I've search around as always and decided to give the Epson V500 Photo Scanner a more in depth look.\nSome of you probably won't even get to my review here but if you do, you'll probably already know that many others have very good things to say about this scanner and I'm no exception. I don't know how Epson does it but their photo restoration technology is amazing! We tried scanning photos that were taken during the 1960s era and a lot of them were very 'yellowish' and faded in color. We scanned the picture with both options turned on (Dust removal and Color Restoration I believe) and we were literally blown away with the outcome. Honestly, no words can really describe it. It's just something you have to see for yourself in order to appreciate this technology.\nI forgot to mention that installation was a breeze itself. Just pop in the CD, click a few buttons, wait a couple of minutes, turn on your printer and that's it! You'll be scanning photos and films in no time! If you are a serious photo collector and want to build a digital collection of those photos but don't want to spend a fortune, you can't go wrong with this product.;Very impressive photo scanner!
50;100.0;5.0;5.0;I'm so happy with this scanner. There were no problems setting it up. I have thousands of old Tri X negatives to scan, and I wanted high resolution so that I'd have the option of printing enlargements, as well as sharing online. I've been scanning in the pro mode on my IMac at 16 bit, 3200 dpi, and it takes just over a minute per image, much faster than I expected. (That's not counting loading the carrier, previewing, etc, just the actual scan.) On advise of other reviewers, I've adjusted the histogram to the extremes of black and white (1-255) and have unchecked the unsharp mask (b/c it makes the grain worse) and am not using digital ICE. The ICE doesn't work with black and white film, so I'm just blasting the negs with compressed air on both sides. Also, most digital ICE doesn't work with Kodachrome, so I sent my slides to scancafe.com. I'm sure ICE will be useful for when I get around to my color negs, a few months from now!\n\nAmazon doesn't always have it in stock, but I kept checking back and ordered it once they had it in. It arrived promptly and in good shape, all the way to Hawaii. Thanks, Amazon!;Great for b/w negs on a Mac
54;101.0;5.0;5.0;For those that prefer a short review, just read the first paragraph.\n\nI have always been pleased with Epson's printers, so I decided to trust them with their scanner technology. The Epson Perfection V500 Photo Scanner exceeds my expectations and needs. Well worth the $199 price tag.\n\nTen years ago, my father gave me some 200 slides he shot while serving in Vietnam. He was going to throw them away! I took them, and decided to scan them all to preserve them digitally. The technology back in 1998 was not great. I gave up, as the slides were covered in hair and dirt and my attempts at cleaning the slides failed. In addition, I later became custodian of hundreds of family slides.\n\nTen years later (2008), I do research into getting these slides professionally scanned, and come to the conclusion that it will cost me thousands of dollars to have the slides professionally restored and digitized. I decide to start looking at buying a scanner and see, through reviews like this, that others faced the same challenge.\n\nAfter reading the reviews for this Epson Perfection V500 Photo Scanner, I figured that $199 was not much of a risk.\n\nLast night I scanned some very filthy slides. To my utter amazement, the Digital Ice technology worked like magic!!! The dirt and hair disappeared! I work in the technology field, I understand how this stuff works, but it still blew me away, it really works!!!\n\n*** This will not clean up prints!!! Only slides!!! ***\n\nI have saved myself at least $2,000. Not to mention I do not have to give precious slides over to strangers, hoping they don't destroy them by accident.\n\nThis scanner is worth the $199 as a normal scanner, it can scan up to 12,800 DPI. But for anyone that needs to scan old slides, ones that need some serious cleaning, this scanner is money-in-the-bank!;Digital Ice = Magic!
77;102.0;5.0;5.0;This is a great scanner. I bought it for scanning black and white film negatives, primarily medium format. Here's a tip. For medium format use the Professional Mode, which gives you the most options. Using the negative carrier is great for traditional cameras, but if you are scanning negatives taken with a Holga, place the film directly on the glass and uncheck the thumbnail button. This way you'll be able to select the portion of the negative that is scanned. Scanning Holga negatives using the negative carrier will cut off the cool edges of the frame unique to the Holga.;Great for Film Scanning - Holga Negative Tip
79;103.0;3.0;5.0;First, the product illustration is misleading. You can only scan film in the narrow windlw straight down the middle. Slides won't scan in the position shown in the picture.\n\nSecond: If you are a Windows Vista user, well, the version that came with the scanner I just got from Amazon includes a version of Photoshop Elements that won't even start. You get a compatability window warning. The Microsoft stuff vectors you to a page that has updates but no Vista patches. Searching shows that Adobe might eventually bring out a Photoshop Elements 5 for Vista but that it is not available yet, and there is no comment about providing a version 4 patch.;Um, Vista?  Photoshop Elements?
80;104.0;5.0;5.0;"The Epson Perfection V500 Photo Scanner is exactly as described and works very well.  While not speedy at higher resolutions (4800+ dpi for slides, negatives), it is more than fast enough to meet my needs and is faster than other similar products.  Digital ICE is a godsend for dust/mold specs that cannot be brushed off.  Photos and documents scan quickly and accurately.  And the ""instant on"" of the LED light source is a big plus when compared to cold cathode lamps that require several minutes to warm up.  The only caveat I have, and which is not mentioned in any literature, is that the scanner apparently must be attached directly to a computer's USB port and NOT to a USB hub.  Tested on two systems, I found that even using a quality USB 2.0 powered hub, the scanner would scan slowly and the software would lock up.  Plugged directly into the computer USB port, it works flawlessly and speedily.";"Great ""Bang for the Buck"""
86;105.0;5.0;5.0;Easy to use right out of the box. Download the software and (automatically)get an update. Plug it in, turn it on, and start scanning. Scan 3 slides in about 2 minutes or less. Even faster for photos. I've run about 300 slides and photos so far and no problems at all. Running windows XP Home, and use Adobe Photoshop Elements 6. Takes an eleven by nineteen inch space on your desktop. Remember to keep the glass area clean so any dirt specs don't tranfer in the scan. Sounds a bit like r2d2 when it scans (whirring sound) so as an added bonus it will entertain the grand kids. I just can't see how you'd beat this machine, especially for just over $200.;Works For Me
88;106.0;5.0;5.0;This is fast, it does fantastic negative scans (medium format).\n\nI only wish I could have afforded the next one up...my negatives were from the 1920s and larger than medium format...so I had to scan each half of the negative and stick them together...but it scanned so perfectly, the stitching was simple.;Wow
99;107.0;4.0;5.0;I purchased this product after reading several reviews on the amazon website.  It performs well and gave me no suprises.  I use it mainly to convert my old slide collection into digital files.  It allows me to adjust the dpi as well as the jpeg compression so the time to print each slide is pretty much under my control and is directly proportion to the quality desired.\nMy only objection is that it handles only 4 slides at a time.  But here again that is my choice.  For a few hundred dollars more, I could have gotten an Epson which would print 8 slides at a time.\nOverall, I am very satisfied with the V500.;Very satisfied

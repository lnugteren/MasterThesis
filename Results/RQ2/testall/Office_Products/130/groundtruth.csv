3;1.0;4.0;913.0;"Ignore most of the complaints about this model and Palm in general.  Remember what you want a Palm for: storing information in an easy-to-access manner.  For most people, it isn't supposed to be a mini laptop.  It doesn't matter if the specs haven't changed much over the years.  How much has a DayRunner improved in the past couple of decades?  Some innovations make sense, sure.  I've had several PDAs over the past few years because of specific things I wanted (rechargable battery, color screen, wireless access, etc.).  Now I have a E2 (for the Bluetooth, screen, design, and ease of use).  But at the end of the day, my usage has stayed pretty constant.  I want good PIM applications (personal information management) on a small device with a good screen and battery life and the ability to check my email.  That's all I want, and the E2 gives me that.  Sure, Palm could wow us with innovations, but I really can't figure out what they could introduce that would be a ""must-have"" feature.  Competing Windows Mobile devices don't offer anything particularly better either (unless you want a jack of all trades device that isn't particularly good at anything.  In other words, if you want a PDA, this one is great.  Here's why:\n\n1.  For most of the things that anyone does with a Palm, it works great.  In other words, the PIM features work great, and the direct synchronization with Outlook is fantastic (and a new feature only on the past few Palm devices).\n2.  The hardware and ""fit"" of the device is great.  This is the latest in the ""Palm V"" model and it shows.  No gimmicks, just a good device fit and design wise.\n3.  The Bluetooth feature is great, if you need/want it.  Setting up PC Bluetooth sync is easy if you follow the manual and the wizard on the device.  Using it with a phone is a much greater challenge due to the few phones supported directly by Palm.  Check first to see if yours is.  If not, there might be a work-around, but prepare yourself for a few hours on the internet trying to find one.\n4.  The fact that the memory doesn't get erased when the power runs out will be really helpful if you're prone to forgetting to charge your devices.\n\nThe bad:\n1.  Versamail is incredibly difficult to work with.  By far it has taken me the longest time to find out that I can't use it to sync with Outlook as planned (this is because you can't directly Hotsync IMAP accounts with SSL security, nor can you sync an IMAP account to Outlook, points buried in Palm's website).\n2.  As mentioned, getting Bluetooth to work with an unsupported phone is a real pain and not the most reliable connection ever invented.\n3.  Yeah, yeah, it shows fingerprints, should have a power indicator light, and a cradle would have been nice.  A little too much cost-cutting, I think.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with the E2.  It does what I want and probably more than what most people desire (most people probably don't need Bluetooth on a PDA).  If you don't care about Bluetooth or the non-volatile memory on the E2, get the Tungsten E and save yourself $50.";It is great for many things, and not so great for a few
6;2.0;4.0;8.0;"Certainly this device is outdated technology compared with what is currently available in smartphones (Note: not from Palm, they are out of business).. This product's technology is about 10 years old and dates back to about 2004.\n\nI have used Palm devices from the very first one and it was a product that changed my life.  I forgot NOTHING, I had the information I needed at my fingertips.  I was (and somewhat still am) very comfortable using the Palm Tungsten.  NOTE: If you are thinking of purchasing one - be forewarned.... It will not work to well with Windows 7 or 8.  You need to go to the internet and find (from user support groups) the appropriate software ""fixes"" and drivers that will enable it to work with Windows.  It took me the better part of entire day to research the information and get all the ducks in a row, so to speak, to get it to work flawlessly.  Hence the 4 stars as as opposed to 5.\n\nFinally, why did I buy this when today's smartphones will run rings around this handheld PDA?  I had a smartphone and decided it was a huge pain to operate.  The touchscreen was always giving me the wrong item.  Not the screen's fault but my BIG fingers.  Also, I really did not want All the information contained within all tied up in a single device.  I now have a flip phone and my Palm Tungsten PDA.";If you remember using Palm technology this is the one for you (if you know the pitfalls)
5;3.0;2.0;232.0;Palmone had a best seller with the excellent T|E design/feature set at $199 price point in 2003. It took Palmone almost 2 yrs to finally release an update in T|E2. However after intial use for couple of days it has been a huge disappointment.\n\nPro's,\n\n1. It was uses a stable and reliable version of Palm OS.\n\n2. Very nice design, comes with solid stylus & decent flip.\n\n3. Battery life is adequate for 3-4 das of work.\n\n4. Software sync with computer is easy and works like a charm.\n\n5. Screen is clear and bright with excellent fonts.\n\n6. Finally includes Bluetooth for easy web access (GPRS) when coupled with a BT-enabled SonyEricsson cell phone.\n\nCon's,\n\n1. Higher price than T|E (as of April 05).\n\n2. No major change in Palm OS. How many yrs will Palm take to release a new OS?\n\n3. Poor bundle, bulky charger, poor packaging.\n\n4. Below average reliability, see the battery/screen noise issues from T|E series.\n\n5. Very poor warranty support from Palmone.\n\n6. No Wifi or any other new feature.\n\n7. Very old specs for a PDA in middle of 2005. Still has only a slow 200 Mhz processor and tiny RAM.\n\nIn short if you liked T|E and want to use a Palm OS based PDA you have no choice but to buy this overpriced old hardware. Software is excellent, hardware is pathetic.\n\nPS: The poor hardware selection has put Palmone on a fast track to bankruptcy. They have literally stopped making new PDA models. One mistake on Treo and Palm would be history.;Old features, higher price!
2;4.0;3.0;138.0;There is a reason, sadly, why sales of PDA's have shrunk each of the past few years -- a crushing lack of imagination and innovation -- while rival gadgets competing for valuable pocket space, like Apple's iPod, have taken up the slack and have seen booming sales as a result.\n\nThe Tungsten E was a breakthrough in its time, a beautiful piece of engineering with a high-quality color screen and a rock-bottom price of 199 clams. Its main drawbacks -- it's paltry 32MB Ram and it's lack of built-in wireless capabilities -- could be fixed with add-on cards.\n\nBut two years is a long-time in electronics land. Since then, Apple released the iPod mini, which will store the contacts most people use Palms for, plus hold 4GB worth of tunes, for the same price. It's also far smaller than a Palm.\n\nMeanwhile, folks who want the more sophisticated functions that a Palm can deliver -- like medical imaging etc. for docs, photos, sophisticated calculator, email and web surfing on the go -- found the Tungsten E outclassed by Blackberry's, upgraded cell phones, Palm's own Treo and the like.\n\nSo it was odd, and frankly disappointing, to get a look at the new, pricier Tungsten E2. I'd love to see the market research that suggested they could raise prices with a minimal feature upgrade while the competish has been eating their lunch. After a two-year wait, they didn't even increase the 32 MB memory. They merely made it non-volatile flash (something they should have done long, long ago). At a time when Apple is selling a 1GB shuffle for $149 and flash memory is dirt cheap, it's mind-boggling why Palm would choose to link the E2's fabulous hi-res screen to low-rent memory.\n\nAs for what you still don't get: There is no phone, no camera, no thumbpad, no WiFi. This is close to a pure PDA, though it can display pictures and double as a poor-man's MP3 player.\n\nThe added bluetooth -- odd why they went that route instead of the far more common WiFi -- does nothing unless you have a compatible bluetooth phone or computer.\n\nAs with the E, the E2 still is a great design. Clean, simple, portable, shirt-pocketable. No keyboard, but I've never been a thumbpad fan.\n\nMS Office functions are also included -- Word, Outlook, Powerpoint. Why you would use them, however, is a bit bizarre to me. Who wants to spend the time coding in a Powerpoint presentation with a stylus? Yet, if this is important to you, it's here. And having your email with you can be a plus...\n\nHere's a basic product guide:\n\nMono Palm Zire -- Bargain basement model with 7.2 MB of Ram, upgraded from hobbled 2 MB original model. About 100 smackers. Often offered free as bundle deals with new computers. Good starter model for the price, but designed to leave you wanting more. Includes rechargeable battery. Memory can not be upgraded. Horribly skimpy black-on-grey screen.\n\nTungsten T2+, etc.: Deluxe models that feature, in some cases, larger screens/Bluetooth/Wi-Fi/thumbpads with dropdown graffiti screens. All unnecessary features in my book, especially given their much higher prices.\n\nZire 72: Similar to E2, but with a low-rent camera attached.\n\nTreos: These models should be seriously considered if you are a thumbpad fan, or if you want your PDA to also be your phone. But let's face it, how many people can afford spending several hundred smackers on a PDA?\n\nBTW, when comparing, I've found you can generally ignore the speed of the processor. For most Palm functions, the reaction time is near instantaneous, or at most a second or two lag.\n\nAs for PocketPCs, some of them are now very attractively priced and are worth checking out. I've yet to use one extensively, so I'll stick to what I know -- Palms are simple, easy to use and almost guaranteed to improve your productivity. It's like having a backup for your brain. And who doesn't need that?;An odd, disappointing update to Palm's workhorse model...
69;5.0;5.0;92.0;"This is my first organizer ever. I'm totally impressed. After reading some of the reviews here I was scared to put my money on any of these things. Seems like someone had complained about every model out there. This one had at least above average reviews, and  I liked the fact that fewer people complain about the soft boot issue.\n\nNow it's two months later and I can't imagine living without it. I'm a college teacher, with lots of faculty meetings to track, plus a freelance business, and the usual dentist and car appointments. I used to keep a paper ""to do"" list in my shirt pocket, but it doesn't ring if I forget to scan it several times a day. In short, my life is so busy that I was beginning to drop appointments.\n\nI'm happy to report that this tungsten e2 syncs perfectly with Microsoft Outlook 2002. There are a few minor anomalies, but nothing that is a deal breaker. I was disturbed at first to discover that the thing is never really off. I would have liked to be able to totally turn it off when I had no appointments coming up, to save juice. However I've found that this is a none issue. It runs for at least 4 days, sometimes a week and a half before needing a charge.\n\nThe operating system seems quite solid. It locks up maybe once every 2 to 3 weeks, but that requires just a tap of a pen on the reset button on the back, and it comes back all happy in a couple seconds. When I was installing third party software every couple days it would lock up more frequently, but I've got everything I need now, and things have settled down.\n\nI don't use it for email, or for surfing the net. I have a laptop for that, and I didn't want to pay an extra hundred for the wifi card.\n\nThe coolest thing about this e2 is the calendar and alarm, the tasks list, and the contacts. With the hot buttons on the front to access these vital functions, this thing never leaves my person. I even take it climbing in my backpack. Never know when I might want to make a note about something, or meet a new friend and exchange phone numbers.\n\nAfter I bought it and realized how useful it was, I was tempted to exchange it for the treo, which has all this, plus a phone...until I found out that you have to pay at least $50 a month to the phone service to make the internet stuff work. Scratch that! I love this thing. It's perfect for my needs. I did buy the 2 year replacement policy from circuit city. $30 seemed like a small price to pay for peace of mind.\n\nThe software you can get for Palms is amazing. Here is my list of essential software:\n\nUninstall Manager - Northglide\n\nBDicty 5.9 Pro - dictionary, thesaurus and conjugator\n\nPocket Tunes from Normsoft (it is compatible with the ""plays for sure"" windows media player files. I can play free downloadable audio books from the library.)\n\nTide Tool 2.2  - toolworks dot com (if you live near saltwater, a must have)\n\nMessageEase V.5 - faster than graffiti for entering text, and it's free!\n\nAvantGo - captures websites off the net when synced, view them on the commute later. - free!";perfect for an absent minded professor
4;6.0;1.0;66.0;"OK\n\nPalm is no longer the leader in easy to use PDAs.\n\nI love my Tungsten E. Its simple. It does what I want it to do - keep me organized. I bought it after I returned the ""paper weight"" called the T5\n\nSo I bought the E2 thinking it can only get better. Well, no. Its seems that they repackaged the T5 as the E2.\n\nI bought the E2 with the WiFi card that Palmone's website promotes as the best thing since sliced bread.\n\nI couldn't get the E2 to synchronize with my old Outlook info without doing some technological acrobatics. Deleting here and there and adding files here and there.\n\nI go to install the WiFi card and the installation software tells me its incompatible with the E2. Must I point out that Palmone's website specifically says that the card is compatible.\n\nNow I am popping antipsychotics to keep from flushing it down the toilet. I try to sync its new Bluetooth capability with my phone. I found out there are only a limited set of phones that can be easily connected. I proceed to manually connect the phone...the PDA will not recognize the phone either!\n\nArrrrgh!\n\nTime spent = 7 hours trying to get it to sync,30 minutes fooling with the WiFi card, and 30 minutes fooling with the Bluetooth. This includes waiting time for outsourced tech support that was of absolutely no use.\n\nThe only thing good to say is, the screen is brighter.\n\nDo not buy the Tungsten E2. Palm is no longer the leader in easy to use PDAs.\n\nMatter of fact I'm going out to buy another Tungsten E, just in case the one I have breaks.";Just like the T5
74;7.0;3.0;59.0;I bought my first Palm years ago, the classic PalmPilot III. It still works reliably, and never lost the contents of its memory. Hotsync always worked great, and only the slowly deteriorating digitizer function (it got drifty and would not stay calibrated) entice me to look for a new version.\n\nPalm's website has a product recommending feature, and after I plugged in my expectations, it came up with the Tungsten E2. I was happy that I could buy it for less than $200, and it came with lots of nice software.\n\nI intitially could not get the Palm Desktop to install, because I still had the older version on my computer, and this caused an odd error message that had nothing to do with previous software versions. I could not find a way to email tech support through the Palm website, so I took a guess and emailed support@palm.com. I got a reply in less than 24 hours, with advice to make sure earlier software versions were not installed. Good for them that they got back relatively quickly, and good also that they gave me the right answer the first time. Bad that the software was unable to recognize an earlier version and respond with a prompt or other warning (as most software installer utilities will do).\n\nThe E2 itself seems very nice, and the ease of use and nice display made me quite happy at first. I am worried about the non-replaceable rechargeable battery, since it seems that when that starts to lose its ability to hold a full charge, the unit will have to be thrown away...never had that worry with the old Palm III, which used replaceable alkalines! At least most modern rechargables have long useable life spans....\n\nThen the annoyances started. Just as soon as I had decided this was a keeper, and had chucked the packaging material (the retailer will not take it back without the plastic vacuum pack, even if it was destroyed in order to extricate the E2 in the first place), I noticed a very serious bug in the operating system (OS). The FIND function will not find more than 8 contacts, even if many more contacts match the search criteria. At first I thought they limited it to only 8, but remembering the identical function on the old Palm III, I could not believe this. Further checking showed that the screen says that it is able to 'find more?' if I tap a button, and when I do so it indicates that it is displaying additional matches, but it really just shows the first 8 matches again. This is a critical fault in a function that is really necessary for the PDA's primary purpose...that of storing and retrieving many contacts.\n\nI was tipped off, by the E2 forum in the Palm website, that this was a well known problem (wish I had checked this before buying), but also that there were other amazing bugs. One of these is the built-in calculator, which comes up with some real far out answers when using the % key. For example, 200 + 5% is 2.05? How about 210!!!!!\n\nPalm makes it as hard as possible to contact tech support and customer service, but I worked at it and finally had a so-called Level 2 tech support person on the line (from India, it sounded like, and they called me at 10:30 at night). They readily acknowledged the problems, but stated that Palm had designed the E2 without flash-upgradable OS, and with so many having been made, Palm decided to simply not take them back...can't fix the problem cheaply with a download, so ignore the problem and let the customer twist in the wind.\n\nThe tech support person gave me a phone number and expediting code, which got me through to Palm corporate headquarters and a manager in customer relations. He plainly stated that the E2 did not have any bugs, since the things I was bringing up were actually designed that way, and as such were design features, not faults. No argument I made could get him to admit that this was a problem. When I pressed him for help and said his 'company line' was clear BS, he stated that the problems had gone as far as the CEO of Palm, who had decreed that the company would not admit a fault and would not fix, take back or in any other way remedy the problems. He said the company position is that the E2 is a 'low end' product, and cannot be expected to work as well as the more expensive products in their line!\n\nWell I cannot return my E2, cannot afford to throw it away and buy a more expensive one, and I do need a PDA that runs Palm OS applications. My solution was to spend another $40 and buy two after-market programs, a scientific calculator application and the IntelligentFind application. Both work fine, and unless the E2 starts to have problems turning on (as many have complained about), I suppose it will do a decent job until I grow tired of it in a few years.\n\nBut, the real rub is that Palm used to be a fine company with a high quality, well thought out and manufactured product of high reliablilty. They are now simply a maker of a consumer commodity, rather like $5 calculators, and their service and support are about as good as one would expect from that scenario. It is sad.;So close, but not a winner....Palm is letting customers down
52;8.0;1.0;50.0;I've have owned a Palm since the introduction of the Palm 2 way back when. The only still-working Palm I replaced, was my very first, the Palm 2. The other five I have purchased since have all failed in some unrecoverable way forcing me to buy a replacment long before I was ready.\n\nIt's been relatively easy in the past to justify purchasing another.  After all, I have all my contacts in the address book and all my critical information stored in Splash ID. What else am I to do, right?\n\nWell, I am now officially completely fed up. My Palm's, including the Palm E2, seem to have an uncanny way of malfunctioning just after the meager warranty period expires.  The unit no longer stays calibrated.  In fact, the calibration seems to be all over the map.  Sometimes I'll tap the screen with the stylus and the the Palm will recognize it an inch or so below where I tapped.  If the mis-calibration would stay consistant, I suppose you might be able to limp along.  The problem is it wonders all over the map.  Palm has no solution other than sending it in for a costly repair.\n\nNo thanks Mr. Palm pilot guys . . . you have taken the last cent you will ever get from me !!  I'M MAD AS HELL AND i'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANY MORE !\n\nAnd that's all I have to say about that . . .;My 10-Year PDA Experiment is now Over !!
98;9.0;5.0;49.0;I've been using my Tungsten E2 for about one month now, and I'm very pleased. I've owned the Tungsten E and Zire 71 models, and the Tungsten E2 is definitely an improvement. The screen looks very good, and it is even readable in direct sunlight. The battery life has been excellent, and the Bluetooth works great. I really think the Tungsten E2 remains an excellent value for those who want lots of functionality but do not require 802.11 wireless or a larger screen (i.e. the TX model). I use mine heavily, and I've not experienced any problems so far. The only thing I don't like about this model is that I can't charge the device via USB. I don't like having to carry the large AC adapter with me when I travel. I miss being able to charge my Zire 71 via the USB cable, whether it was connected to my laptop or the car adapter which came with my USB sync cable. Aside from this one complaint though, I highly recommend this device--even in light of the two new models Palm recently released (the TX and Z22 models). Of course, if you don't mind spending the extra money, go for the TX model. Otherwise, I think the price and features of the Tungsten E2 make it an excellent value.;Excellent value
87;10.0;1.0;30.0;"I ordered this from Amazon.com on October 3, 2005.  I received it two weeks later and immdiately set it up, bought accessories, etc. The unit was wonderful ---until yesterday, January 17, 2006 when the power on/off button stopped working.  I called Palm and was informed that I was out of warranty (90 days from date of purchase) and that I could return the unit to Palm and they would repair it for $149.99 (almost the cost of a new E2 unit)!\n\nI declined this ""customer service"" reps offer and called Amazon.com customer service.  I explained my dilemma and they told me to send the broken unit back to them and that they would issue a full refund and I immediately ordered a replacement from Amazon.com.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, the only way to delete all your information from the handdeld before sending it it for repair is to do a hard reset which involved holding down the power on/off button.  Since this is what was broken on my E2, I spent hours manually deleting entries I didn't want someone else to see before returning it to Amazon.  Thank you Amazon for your excellent customer service.\n\nPalm has a longer warranty period for European Countries -- too bad for those of us who support Palm with our hard earned American dollars.";It malfunctioned As Soon As The Warranty Ran Out
47;11.0;1.0;28.0;When I first bought this PDA for about $200, I was so excited. It was fast, very easy to use, and organized my whole life. After about 2 months, it died and did not recharge anymore. I called to get customer support and was informed that if they continued to help, it would cost me about $40. I was shocked and instead went online for help. Unfornately my battery had just gone dead.\n\nWARNING!!!\n\nAfter calling again and finding out it would cost $160 to fix I was so dissapointed. I could not believe it would cost almost as much as the retail price. The customer service guy told me that my battery had died and hinted it could have been manufacturer defect.\n\nIf it would have worked and continued to work, I would have loved it. It's a great product, but I will never by Palm products again because of the experience. Major disappointment!;It was the best thing at first......
77;12.0;1.0;27.0;I've had my E2 for around 7 months and it just suddenly wouldn't turn on.  There was no warning, it had worked fine the day before, there weren't any battery problems and NONE of the possible trouble shooting suggestions would work.  It is completely dead and no data are accessible.\n\n I couldn't get it to sync or charge from either the AC charger or USB trickle charge.  When I went on Palm One forum, it became evident that over 50 other E2 users have had this problem and Palm isn't responding.  This is my second Palm PDA and I'm done with Palm sadly.  I'd say buyer beware.  If you have questions about this, check out the Palm One forum for possible problems before buying!;over 50 users have the same problem
28;13.0;5.0;25.0;"I would like to offer a somewhat different perspective on this product.  I am not a business person; my thinking and needs are very different from a business person's.  I am a reader, writer, teacher.  Moreover, I am a very disorganized person.  I thought maybe if I had a device that could centralize all the various elements of my life effectively, I could have some peace of mind.  I have never owned an electronic tool of this sort.  After reading and investigation on various brands, I chose this one.  I have to say, it is one of the easiest electronic tools I have ever used.  I didn't buy it for the bluetooth capability, so I can't speak to that.  But it is a wonderfully easy and handy tool for keeping apointments straight and having contact information handy anywhere.  Reading through the description of the E2, I was initially afraid that I would have to buy Microsoft Outlook in order to be able to have a calendar and appointment capability, but this is not true.  The CD that comes with the E2 has those features--and many more--on it.  As a writer, I appreciate the ""Documents to go"" feature.  It is so easy to transfer Word documents to the Palm, and I have put several of my favorite poems on it.  I have also bought a little keyboard to go with my Palm so that I can work on poems/stories while away.  It is so much more compact than my laptop (and I have the smallest laptop that Dell ever made).  It probably wouldn't be a good choice for writing the ""Great American Novel"" on, but for capturing those ideas that just can't wait, and when your brain is working faster than you can write by hand, this is a great device.  I write a lot when I travel.  I can also put my lecture-PowerPoints on the device so that I can review them anywhere.  Finally, with expansion cards, you can also carry music, photos, and video with you.  I do have a 60GB iPod, but, frankly, I am reluctant to carry it with me on some of my more rugged road/boat trips.  And, as much as I love my iPod, I still find putting photos on it to be a confusing process.  (I am not that technically savvy.)  But the E2 works like a dream; simply drag and drop the photos, music, video that you want and there it is!  The E2 also has a small speaker which works surprising well and I use it for listening to poems.  A headphone jack allows for a richer experience for listening to music.  The only downside is that the E2 doesn't have much memory and the expansion cards can be expensive.  But I've decided the expense is worth it because now I can carry so many of my precious documents with me in once device which is fairly rugged (at least compared to the iPod which does not have the more stable flash drive that the E2 does).  So I can use my iPod to store ALL of my music, to plug into my home speakers, and to take on short, easy adventures.  But the E2 can go with me practically everywhere.  The E2 is small, light, fast, easy to use.  I really, really like it.";A Writer-Teacher's take
95;14.0;2.0;26.0;I've been a palm user for many years, from Zire to Tungsten E and then E2. I was impressed by the cost and the new features of E2. However one fine day, 4 months after its purchase, it hung up during hotsync and even the soft and the hard reset aren't working. It totally died, and I've no idea what caused it.\n\nI would not recommend Tungsten E or E2 to anyone who wants to keep it for sometime, as their operating systems are vulnerable and thats the reason palm only gives a 90 day warranty on them, compared to 1 year for Tungsten T5 and TX.\n\nIts small 32MB memory is too small for any professional user, so invest a little more and get the more high end models.;Lasted a few months only..
76;15.0;1.0;25.0;I am a network administrator for several small businesses, and have the misfortune of supporting several of these devices.  Sometimes they work, but in some other cases a user's calendar will simply not synchronize with Outlook.  A long, difficult trip up Palm's support tree eventually leads to their techs recommending you buy a third party synchronization product.  So, only purchase this device if you either don't care about synchronization with Outlook, or you are willing to pay 50$ to buy a third-party synch package.  The claim Palm makes that this device can synch with Outlook is false, and Palm is aware that it is false, and will refuse to provide you with any remedy when you contact them.  Avoid if you value your time!;Synchronization features are atrocious - in some cases it simply does not work
0;16.0;1.0;26.0;"I've been buying Palm handhelds from the very first one (Palm Pilot). I've been periodically upgrading to the next model... UPGRADING???!!!\n\nIt seems that the company is going backward running against quality. The first ones came in good and robust plastic body, well assembled. Then they made the m500 series very good finished, in a metal body. Since then the handhelds come now in a poor plastic body, metal like painted, that easily scratchs showing the white plastic behind. The Stylus peel off (m500's). The brand and model in the front of the machine come off in a few days (Tungsten E). The flip cover simply breaks apart after months of use (Tungsten E), without chance to be replaced because palmOne doesn't sell it as an accessory. Now I bought the E2 thinking is was going to be better than E and, sorprise!!! It's slower. Even the stick in the Stylus we use to reset it is so weak that bends when we make the minimum pressure on it. The E model got charged throught the USB cable, great advance! and now its successor doesn't do it.\n\nWhat's worse, same thing happens with cameras, cars, and so on... higher prices, less quality!!!\n\nAt this point, I am not pretty sure I will remain being as loyal with palmOne handhelds.

51;17.0;1.0;23.0;This is the third Palm PDA I have owned.  I bought the E2 directly from Palm after my previous palm died. It simply quit shortly after the warranty expired. Telephone support is poor and expensive.  After research this is a common problem.\n\nMy employer pays for PDA's for executives and since I approve of all of these products, I will hereafter not allow any purchase of any Palm product based on falty products, poor customer support and extremely poor customer support.;BAD PRODUCT  / BAD COMPANY
86;18.0;1.0;22.0;How can something that cost $200 only have a 90 day warranty? You have to pay $25 for them to even see what is going on with it and then on top of that - more money to shell out past 90 days - anywhere from $100-200. I would NEVER buy this unit over the internet or get it without an extended warranty from a store. Palm is obviously not backing up this model or the warranty would be much longer.;HORRIBLE warranty. Palm should be ashamed of themselves!!
103;19.0;1.0;22.0;"I have been using Palm for 7 years by now, and Tungsten E2 is the 3rd Palm I have bought. Unfortunately, this Palm is a total disaster because:-\n\n1) The screen starts to scream like crazy after several days of use. Their technical hotline people confirms they found it a common problem of their new generation of Palm devices BUT REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING TO HELP! They refused to replace it because they claimed that the creaming screen problem will come back sooner or later. Ironically they recommended a third-party software that they claim it reduce the annoying noise, but at my cost!\n\n2) I have accumulated nearly 1200 of contacts in my Palm, and it became IMPOSSIBLE for me to search for a person's contact because the global find function CAN ONLY DISPLAY THE FIRST 8 MATCHES. That means if I have 20 contacts with first name ""Peter"", and I use the Find function to locate ""Peter""... I will never see the 9th to 20th ""Peter""s. Unlike previous Palms that if I click on ""Find more"" it returns the next batch of matches, this Tungsten_E2_piece_of_junk will return you the same 1st to 8th matches even I click on ""Find more"". I email their support, they admitted it and refused to help any further than recommending another 3rd-party software that will again cost me extra money!\n\nTHUS... I believe that NOBODY SHOULD SPEND THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY ON A CRAPPY THING LIKE THIS!\n\nI do want to want you to be aware of these problems, and Palm has known it for some time and has done nothing to fix them. (Apparently, according to other Internet newsgroup discussion, their newer models such as T5 also has same problems.) Do the search and you will find...";A total disaster!
63;20.0;1.0;21.0;I bought my Tungsten E2 on 3/8/06, as of 6/22/06 the digitizer is malfunctioning. The area of the digitizer where one taps on 'details' no longer responds reliably to tapping. Recalibrating the digitizer has no effect. I've seen this happen on a few Palm devices (Vx, Samsung i500), but never so quickly.\n\nI warranty is 90 days, a good clue to Palm's opinion of this device. The Lifedrive has a 1 year warranty.\n\nThis device is still covered by my AMEX extended warranty and I'll probably get my money back this way.\n\nIn retrospect I should have noticed how short the warranty period was on this device and that other, more costly, devices had a 1 year warranty. Stay away from any device with a 90 day warranty.;Digitizer dying at age 3 months
113;21.0;4.0;21.0;This is actually my first handheld, though I am quite familiar with a number of competitive products through my job.\n\nI have been extremely happy with this device for the two months I have owned it.  The performance of the device is very snappy, the display crisp, clear and bright, though it is easily washed out in bright light or outdoors.  (Pretty much all commercial units have this problem, when you start getting to high cost industrial units with transflective displays, this becomes less of an issue.)\n\nBattery life has been superb, but I should caveat that with my usage level.  I doubt I would be considered a hardcore user.  My device is probably active (display on) for approx 2hours per day.  At this level of usage, I typically go 3 days before I feel the need to recharge (not that the unit is dead.)  During a recent 12 day vacation where my usage dropped to perhaps 1 hour or less per day, I never placed the unit on charge.\n\nThe supplied applications are great, better than their counterparts in Outlook and synchronization between the two is superb.  I initially used the supplied USB synch cable to keep the unit trickle charging, but I was not impressed with the connection this cable makes to the handheld.  Removing the cable takes some effort, as the connector is overly secure and does not have a mechanical release mechanism.  I grew concerned that over time the connector would begin to wear and become less positive.\n\nSince I use a bluetooth keyboard/mouse, going to bluetooth synchronization was a no brainer.  The setup was simple and it works flawlessly.  Since I do not leave my Palm in a discoverable mode, and it cannot be woken by my PC, I have not noticed any impact in battery life with BT enabled.  My only wish is that PALM had made BT synchronization schedulable, allowing it to automatically attempt a synch at preset times during the day.  There is 3rd party software to do this, but it seems a minor issue that PALM could address easily.\n\nI truly appreciate the physical qualities of the unit.  Though looking at the dimensions in comparison to an IPAQ or AXIM does not lead to any great expectations, the unit is far easier to stash in a pocket without weighing you down or being two bulky.  This leads to a love hate relationship with the cover.  I keep my E2 in the thigh pocket of my trousers.  The small supplied cover does a fair job of protecting the screen and adds no bulk to the unit.  But it does not prevent items (coins, and LINT) from getting to the screen.  The coins I can prevent, but the lint is another issue.  I find myself cleaning the screen every two hours.  If the cover was magnetic or in someother way provided a better seal, it would be ideal.  All of the aftermarket wallets I have looked at, while attractive, will add considerable bulk to the device.\n\nI appreciate that the stylus has a nice heft to it, and does not have a push button ejector (these have always appeared to me as a weak link.)\n\nThe battery charger connector works better than the synch cable in that I don't feel it is going to wear out any time soon, but the charger itself is massive.  I think Palm could have sourced a more compact, folding unit.\n\nI wish there was a vibrate mode, but I am not too torn up about it.\n\nThe handwriting recognition (graffitti 2) works far better than I expected, though this is an area I never test on devices I look at, so it may be par for the course.\n\nThe non-volatile flash is great.  I have made use of the feature only once (on purpose to see how it works) and it is truly wonderful.  I needed to reenter the current date and time, but other than that the unit picked up right where I left it.\n\nI have no real complaints about the lack of Wi-Fi or camera (in my opinion the cameras are a ridiculous add on) since I knew these were not standard when I purchased the unit, and not something I was really interested in having.\n\nBased on my purchase cost, (...), the ease of use and physical design, I am very happy with this device.;Well designed and thought out
64;22.0;1.0;20.0;I bought the Palm Tungsten E2 Handheld PDA about three months ago.  In the meantime, I've spent almost $200 in software and an SD card.  It was totally loaded as I wanted.  I had only recharged four times, at most.  Everything was perfect, I was in love.\n\nThen a fatal error.  Recovered from that.  Then, another fatal error.  I lost access to all programs on main harddrive(?).  When I tried to reformat and start over, I couldn't get back to the main menu.  No resetting, nothing.  When it was off, I noticed that there was a burned spot in the screen.  It's fried.\n\nBack to the drawing board.  I'm almost forced to go back to Palm because of the investment I have in software.\n\nNeedless to say,  PLEASE don't buy this piece of junk.;It's fried
114;23.0;4.0;21.0;"Overall, I find the E2 a joy to use.  The screen is beautiful, the processor is fast and the casing looks expensive.  Furthermore, the Bluetooth hotsync works effectively so I never need to use the cable again.  I have a light weight computer, Apple Powerbook G4 12"", so I do not think it is necessary to have a PDA loaded with functions, which are often too complex to use and too expensive to buy.  The E2, like the original idea of the Palm Pilot, is designed to replace the address book, memo pads, that we must carry, plus a few new tricks in a light and relatively inexpensive package.  The downside of this is the lack of a good carring case with a belt clip.  The E2 does come with a piece of rubber to cover its screen but this does not offer protection if you need to carry it with you all the time, which is something that a PDA supposed to do.  I have this for about one month and so far there is no quality control issue as yet.  I do find the screen a little numb and not as sensitive as my old Palm III but I can live with that.  In summary, I still highly recommend it.";A good all around PDA
1;24.0;4.0;21.0;This is a follow-up after two months of usage. I must say that I am a little dissapointed with the reliability. Oflate whenever I open Docs To Go, it freezes and I've to perform a soft reset. I've also been having problems with the Digitizer. If the problems keep at this rate, I am not sure I'll ever buy a Palm again. Will keep you all posted if there are more issues. *Sigh*\n**************************************************\nI had a m515 a couple of years ago when it crashed and never woke up. I somewhat apprehensively decided to get this Tungsten E2 mainly because it has non-volatile memory and so here I am.\n\nFirst about the case itself: It is a solid case with a solid look of steel and I suspect that this is for a reason along with the fact that they got rid of the cradle systems. Traditional Palm PDAs did come with a cradle and they did have quite a bit of issues with the SUDS (Sudden USB Death Syndrome). The steel finish is elegant but it does leave smudges which is managable. For whatever reason they decided to leave this finish, personally it is fine with me. I don't get it when people complain that they are dissapointed when there is no cradle. Good thing I don't have to lug a cradle while travelling and if not will have to buy a travel charger.\n\nCompared to the previous m515 I've had, this is a steal for $249. The interface is very good and I really like the crisp display. All in all, looks like they took the best of the Tungsten E model and improved it. It took a bit of time figuring out to play mp3s using the Realplayer. I had to format my SD Card using FAT instead of the FAT32 file system. After this step, adding and removing songs was a breeze. I must say that I am totally blown by the music quality. Agreed that the built-in speaker isn't meant for this but on a headphone it is awesome.\n\nThe operation speed is pretty good and a 10 hr battery life doesn't hurt at all (mighty impressive). Haven't played around with Bluetooth yet and it's dissapointing that if I need wireless, I've to shell out another 100 bucks for it. For now, I am satisfied with the base version and I don't think I'll go for wireless anyway. Additional SD Card would probably be a good idea if one needs more songs on the go.\n\nBottomline is that this is a decent PDA for the price (which is bound to go down shortly) and if you know the limitations and capabilities and don't have high expectations you'll be satified. Just keep your fingers crossed if your unit goes bad and is out of warranty (Palm support has been legendary in being terrible).\n\nHopefully we don't have to deal with it.;Not so bad after all initially.. (dissapointed later)
54;25.0;1.0;19.0;I just puchased the Tugsten E2 to replace my old Sony CLIE.  It synced up with my computer the first try out of the box. At my next attempt at a sync, I got  fatal eror and lost all the data on my computer.  Now i can't sync and have no backup of my data.  I've tried every trick from Palm and the user forums, the answer may be to do a total reset which will lose all my data.  I'm ready to toss this unit out the window;Fatal error
57;26.0;4.0;19.0;This is a great device for what it's meant to do. It's designed to store and organize pieces of imformation, personal data, notes, etc. not function as a mini-laptop. For these purposes, it works great. The screen is large and clear, everything is easy to navigate and the battery life is incredible. The PIM functionality is good. Being able to attach notes to to-do list items that are then cross-referenced in the calendar is very useful for keeping things organized. The address book holds everything you'd ever want to know about a persn and then lets you add your own custom fields.  Bluetooth is a nice feature and easy to configure, but not necessary for what the palm does, so I consider it an added bonus. This certainly isn't the be-all and end-all of mobile devices, but if you're looking for a well-designed tool to store and organize information that nees to be readily accessible, then the Tungsten E2 shoudl do the job jsut fine.;Great for what tis' designed to do
67;27.0;1.0;19.0;My main problem with the PalmOne Tungsten E2 does not involve the features or applications, but with the endless number of technical problems I have had to endure.\n\nWhere do I begin?  This is currently my 4th model of the Tungsten E.  I bought the Tungsten E in 2003 and then they came out with the E2.  After 1 month I had to replace my Palm because the touchscreen became so unaligned there was nothing I could do to fix it but just exchange it with a new one.  I thought that would help.  3 months later I had the exact same problem with the touchscreen alignment.  About 9 months later the headphone jack that I use for the RealOne MP3 player gave a static underscore to my music and would come in and out of sound.  And now I am on to my 4th.  What is the problem with this one?  One day I reached over to grab my Palm and found the screen completely grey, for no reason whatsoever and without notice the device would not work at all, no help from the buttons, if I tried to do a hotsync, the computer didn't recognize the item.  I had faced the fact that it just crashed, but the next day when the screen was black, I connected it to the charger and charged it for 5 hours and it came back to life.  However, now the headphone jack is currently only working for the right side of my headphone.  Yes, that is right, any headphone I use I can only get the sound coming from the right side.  What a piece of trash!  For $200 plus $100 for the protection plan and memory cards, I expect a reliable electronic item I can come to trust for many many years, but since my protection plan is over in August, I am just waiting for my device to finally die and there will be no way for me to replace it.  I warn any consumer:\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!;Worst purchase I have ever made.
96;28.0;4.0;19.0;This is my third palm pilot...I found it very easy to set up,and easy to use...My unit has been trouble free..My previous units had memory wipe problems..My cell phone rang,and my palm was blank...Customer service was lacking to say the least...I received this one as a gift...,so im happy for now...After reading the reviews,from my fellow reviewers,i can see the unit is good,if you are lucky...If you purchase the palm,please make sure they have a good return/refund/exchange policy,before purchasing...These units are very sensitive to static electricity...This may explain the data memory issues,that some people have experienced...I thank you stewart l 12/07/05.;A good pda from palm. The E2 works well for me,as long as i don't need service.
48;29.0;4.0;18.0;With none of the Plasticky goodness of the Z-22, or the 'Mobile Chernobyl' power of the Lifedrive, the E2  is an excellent mid-range buy. I was looking for my first PDA to keep me organized as I re-entered the job market, and (eventually) got the E2. From the moment it came out of the box, my E2 has kept me happy- the bright, crisp screen, easy to use controls, good looks and practical software bundle. Information is password protected, and the layout is easy to follow. Many moan and groan over Graffiti 2,which turns movements of the stylus into typed script, but I just use the on-screen keyboard, and do just fine. the battery keeps going for several days, even with constant use. Some things to remember:\n\nIt is NOT an mp3 player!!\n\nIt IS a great wasy to store a lot of info on the go, combining datebook, calendar, and phone index into a sharp looking package\n\nComes with hotsync cable and recharger, but the cradle is  worth buying, as it will stand the E2 up while charging, so you can keep working\n\nGo ahead and spring for a PDA holder of some kind, as the Stainless steel casing shows wear easily, and the screen is far to sensitive for a pocket or purse, (I have the Krusell Handit Leather Case W/cilp myself)\n\nThis PDA is good for personal/light business work, and strongly recommend it for a first time buyer.;The Volvo of the Palm line
107;30.0;4.0;19.0;I had always resisted buying a handheld because I didn't think I'd use it for anything, but as I  started managing more and more of my personal data electronically through address books and phone dialing lists, I decided the time had come.  After reading countess reviews of different PDA models, and suffering a great deal of sticker shock (600$ for a PDA?  Who the hell can afford that?)  I settled on the E2.  My criteria were:\n\n*I wanted something with bluetooth so I could use my Motorola v551, which also has built-in bluetooth, as a modem.\n\n*I wanted basic PIM features: contact list, calendar, task list, etc.\n\n*I wanted email capability\n\n* I wanted a reasonable price\n\nI must say, on the whole, I am extremely pleased.  The E2 is an excellent, no-frills device that delivers on all the above points.  The good stuff:\n\n* The PIM features are generally easy to figure out without referring to an instruction manual.\n\n* Graffiti is a good deal easier to use than I thought it would be\n\n* Navigation is very, very intuitive, whether you do it using the stylus or the four-way navigation key.\n\n* I have seen people complain about the metal casing, but I find it very attractive and sleek, even if it does hold fingerprints.\n\n* It's conveniently sized-tiny enough to fit comfortably in my front pocket.\n\n*The battery life is astonishing-I've been fiddling with it almost continuously for days, and it still doesn't need charging.\n\nThere are some negatives as well:\n\n* The device has a very tiny amount of on-board memory, so while it comes bundled with MP3 and audiobook software, you're not going to be making much use of them without a memory card.  Ditto for any extra software.\n\n* The palm memory cards are basically overpriced MMC cards, which you can purchase at any electronics store for a noticeably lower price.\n\n* There is no cradle or case, and no extra stylus in case you loose the one that comes with it.\n\n* Palm needs to stop wasting valuable space by etching a writing area at the bottom of the screen-why not just write anywhere on the screen, like the windows handhelds, and give us some more viewing space?\n\nOn the whole, this is an excellent entry-level, no-frills handheld, and a good choice for someone who has never used a handheld device before (like me).  It doesn't have a lot of fancy extras, but it's ease of use, long battery life, and solid feature set make up for this.\n\nA word about using this device with a phone to send email or access the internet-if you plan on doing this, make sure you go the palm site and check before you buy to make sure your phone is supported.  You will need to download the latest phone drivers as well.  Make sure your phone has bluetooth and that you also have data service on your phone plan.  Establishing a bluetooth connection with the phone was easy and took seconds-configuring the phone and the palm to send and recieve email was not.  There are a multitude of settings, many of them not very well explained, and if something goes wrong, it will be difficult to figure out if the phone, ISP, or handheld is at fault.  It took me the better part of a day to get versamail to send email through the phone's GPRS service.  If you are not technically adept, it may be easier for you to either buy a Wi-Fi card, or to pass on this and buy a more expensive model with built-in Wi-fi.  I'd also note that data speeds over a data phone connection are very slow-fine for sending email, but not good for accessing the web.  If you want to surf the web on a handheld, spring for wi-fi.;Excellent no-frills Handheld
99;31.0;4.0;18.0;The screen display is beautiful and the battery life is great. I only need to charge my E2 once or twice a week. Bluetooth and Wifi were easy to set up and work fine in terms of Hoysyncing and Lan Access, as well as for sending and receiving files to all paired devices that were bluetooth enabled. I've owned an E2 for one month now.\n\nThe E2 is not a multimedia powerhouse. My MP3's sound alot better on my Zire 72 than E2. Moreover, due to the slower processor and new NVFS memory system, I cannot listen to music and surf the web on my E2 simultaneously without some interference on the music side like I can on my Zire 72.\n\nAs long as the multimedia limitations of the E2 are understood in advance, this is a very good PDA for a businessman or mobile entrepreneur who also needs to surf the internet and check  Email. It does take a couple of seconds for the Blazer Browser to close after a web session is concluded. But then again that is due to the slower processor speed.\n\nIf you are a wise shopper, you'll find that the E2 is well worth the money.;Well Worth the Money
101;32.0;1.0;18.0;"As a physician I had hoped to load my in-hospital patient data bases, and a few handy medical reference programs, onto my E2's memory card (512meg);however, I found that none of the programs permit themselves to be loaded onto removable media (for fear of piracy) -- except for the great folks at ePOCRATES, who permit you to download their program to main memory or to memory card -- so the measely 20 usable megs on the E2 are virtually useless to me.  Further, despite deleting the aforementiond databases from my E2 and my hard drive, I have yet to accomplish a hot-synch without my E2 crashing -- and requiring soft resets each doggone time...\n\nAfter 4 weeks of dissappointment, I,ve given away my E2 and have just bought (for $60 more)the Palm TX, which has 100 megs of usable memory, and few more bells and whistles such as Wi-Fi and a huge screen, for example";Limited RAM means limited utility
109;33.0;5.0;18.0;An upgrade from the E (which had to return because of a bad screen). Same price as the E with the $50 rebate, so why not?\n\nNice upgrades such as using your own photo's for backgrounds, better intergrated programs, better battery life - used over a week now including at least an hour of music and barely 1/8 down.\n\nSetting up the sync was a little tougher since I upgraded. The sync keep trying to sync my old stuff. Finally figured it out but took some time. Palm doesn't supply very good directions for set up. Especially when upgrading.\n\nI use a Mac and sync with iCal, Address and Stickbrain. Works great.\n\nI would most definetly get an extended warranty. PDA's are known to break down for various reasons and since you're spending $200 +/-, it's worth it!;Wonderful! Very Pleased
92;34.0;3.0;17.0;If the Tungsten E2 is going to be your first Palm device, you'll probably be very pleased with it.  If you are upgrading from a previous Palm, you'll probably be very disappointed with the reduced/missing/changed functionality.\n\nMost of my complaints (except for the connectors) are due to the operating system (Palm OS v5.40017) and therefore would apply to any Palm running the v5.4 OS.\n\nI bought the E2 to replace my Zire 71 (due to digitizer problems that have gotten worse over time).  I knew the bottom connectors (hotsync and power) would be different than the 71, but I was hoping they would be standard connectors like that on the E.  They are not.  They are proprietary.  That means you will pay a premium for extra cables.\n\nThe 5-way navigator's function has changed.  Now it does nothing in most of my 3rd party apps.  Before I could navigate with the 5-way with screen taps kept to a minimum, now it is practically useless.  Why the change when it worked so well before?\n\nOn older Palms, the center button on the 5-way, when pressed with the unit off, would bring up the World Clock app. for a few seconds.  Now the center button does nothing with the unit off.  Progress would have been to allow one to select the app. that is launched with the button and even allow one to set the seconds before power down.  Instead, someone decide an improvement was to remove the feature entirely.\n\nGraffiti 2.  A lot has been written about this.  If it was just learning new key strokes, I wouldn't complain.  First, it takes more key strokes to write certain characters.  More key strokes means taking more time and having more chances of making an error.  This is a step backwards.\n\nThe second issues with G2 is timing.  You can't write at a set cadence because you have to wait for multi stroke characters to be drawn to the screen or else your strokes will be misinterpreted.  Another step backwards.\n\nI realize one can buy Teal Script and regain G1 functionality, but shouldn't the unit come with state of the art pen entry software?  I put G1 on my Zire, but that same trick doesn't work on the E2.  There are modified Graffiti files that enable you to put G1 on the E2, but I've heard they don't allow punctuation.  If that is true, I don't see the value of them.  Remember that G2 was developed due to a law suit  against G1 and not driven by innovation.  The kicker is that the law suit doesn't even apply now and G1 could be included on new Palms.\n\nThe E2 feels slower than my Zire 71.  I've read that the non-volatile E2 memory access is the cause of this.  I am not sure if this is true or not, but whatever, I expected the E2 to be as quick or quicker than the 71 and not slower.  Granted the difference is slight but very perceptible especial in side by side comparisons.\n\nI would return the E2 for another model Palm, but the only one currently out there that has a different operating system is the Zire 72 and I don't want the camera or the extra size of that unit.\n\nAll in all I am keeping the E2 because there are no other Palm choices and I want to stick with my Palm apps ... but I am not happy about it.  My first Palm was a Palm III.  Each subsequent Palm purchase has always been a pleasant experience with the excitement of discovering the advances of the new unit.  This unfortunately has not been the case with the E2.;If upgrading from an old Palm, you'll be disappointed.
65;35.0;1.0;16.0;I have had this less than 9 months and it will no longer turn on.  I've lost all the info in there that I didn't back up recently.  Basically, the problem is that it won't recharge, although I've tried everything they suggest to resolve the problem.  From looking on the palm website, I've learned that this is not an uncommon problem with the E2.  From now on, it's an old-fashioned pad and paper all the way.;What a waste of money
97;36.0;3.0;16.0;The E2 *was* my fourth pda. I bought my E2 after my clie died (worked ok for two years). After 8 months I awoke one morning and without any warning, the E2 digitizer was off calibration by about 5mm. I had to touch the screen *above* where I really wanted to touch. Calibration failed and could not correct the error. I did a hot sync and soft reset, but no luck. Finally did a hard reset and that solved the problem, but for only two weeks. I was about to do the Hot Sync / Hard Reset treatment, when I accidently rolled over onto it while it was in my pocket. Now I have a night-light. The backlite glows continuously and doesn't respond to any button.;Nice palm for a while
100;37.0;4.0;16.0;"Two months ago, I replaced my well-loved T|E with the E2, primarily for the Bluetooth. This has exceeded my expectations and Bluetooth become an essential tool for e-mail collection.  On the T|E I never succeeded in collecting mail via my GPRS enabled phone (using infrared).  With the E2 it astonishingly easy to set up. It helps having an old, ubiquitous, phone I think.\n\nThis newer model E2 still provides the right funtionality, right battery life, right weight at the right price. Just some poorly thought out ""improvements"" over the previous model.\n\n1. The T|E2 is slower than my T|E. This is really distracting when writing graffiti, which I do quite quickly. The T|E never lagged behind, but the E2 does. I conclude that this arises from the use of flash memory. Go back to the other type, please.\n\n2. The standard mini-USB port on the E2 has been replaced by a proprietory port. I liked the USB port. I could use my identical Canon camera cable for the T|E. This allowed the other one to stay at work. Now I carry the cable round with me.\n\n3. The T|E2 charger socket. Why has this changed? My old charger does not work with the new unit.\n\n4. The 5-way button navigation has changed in PalmOS 5.4. Perhaps to be more Windows like - a mistake. On the TE I could navigate through notepad entries with the left and right edge. Now these simply move focus between on-screen buttons, so I have to navigate to the left or right on-screen button and press the centre key to activate the button - tiresome.";Tungsten E2 vs E.

My one complaint about Palms (and the reason I only give it 4 stars) is that the battery can not be replaced by the user.";Good blend of old and new features
61;39.0;2.0;15.0;"Last year, I purchased an E2 to replace my Tungsten E - which had become increasingly difficult to turn on and impossible to turn off: the power switch died within months of purchasing it and I had to use the function buttons (e.g. the address book / date book buttons) to get it to come on. When even those became iffy, I purchased the E2. However, I bought the extended warranty for that unit because of the power button issues.\n\nSure enough, the power button failed within 2 months. I haven't had a chance to return it for service yet because the warranty (even the extended third-party warranty) requires that I ship it off somewhere, potentially being without it for up to two weeks. This is unacceptable from a service standpoint - if you have a PDA, chances are you rely pretty heavily on it and cannot be without it that long!! If you do purchase such a thing, find out if the retailer has any sort of local replacement service!!\n\nIt has the same very annoying screen hum the Tungsten E had. I mostly just tune that out.\n\nIt locks up and must be reset fairly often when I try to use Adobe Reader. It also locks up at other, random times - all seem to be when I use third-party software. I've got a game card (PopCap) that ran fine on the Tungsten E, but on the E2, about half the games come up saying ""need x amount of memory, you only have xxx amount free"". Since the available amount is considerably more than the needed amount, the games *should* run. Must be an OS conflict.\n\nThe screen display is great indoors but very, very hard to read outdoors in the sun. I think that's a problem with pretty much any PDA though.\n\nOn the plus side: Nice looks. Screen display is decent. Lots of applications available. Battery life usually serves nicely for a full day of out-and-about (I tend to pop the thing out whenever I'm waiting anywhere, to play games or read ebooks, so it gets used heavily).\n\nThe included sync cable is an improvement over the Tungsten E, in that it's got a button to sync. You can plug in your powered-off unit, and hit the button on the cable, rather than having to power up the unit to do it from the screen, or having to reserve one of the function buttons for the purpose.\n\nI'd consider going with a Pocket PC device next time around except my spouse uses a Palm also and we want to stay on the same platform.\n\nOne really major, Major, MAJOR omission on the part of the Palm OS: They really need to include tools to help multi-PDA households share databases - the whole family uses the date and address capability and it's a pain to manually keep them up to date. We've tried two third-party alternatives: GroupSync, which ran in the background with every sync but was very, very wonky - duplicated entries constantly - and didn't work when we moved to a Tungsten platform; and SyncUs, which requires us to manually bring up the application, which compares differences in the two users and suggests things we should copy from one to the other (and makes that easy by providing appropriate onscreen buttons). Although that requires manual intervention, it works flawlessly.";Functional but shares quality issues with original Tungsten E
75;40.0;4.0;15.0;"I've had Palms as long as I can remember, and now the Tungsten E2 at last has bluetooth, a beautiful screen, good battery life and lots of flash memory. All the usual facilities are fast and reliable - contacts, diary, memos, to do lists, and the bluetooth works a treat. I use a Motorola Razr V3 and VersaMail (built in) and all I do is bring up VersaMail, tap 'get mail' and wait while it contacts the telephone on my belt, retrieves all the mail and signs off again.  And I have TomTom navigation which is superb.\n\nHowever, I have had some problems:\n\n1. the case is not as strong as the old Palms and has to be treated with care;\n\n2. the first two I had were faulty - on one the touch screen broke down on day 2;\n\n3. the new Palm OS seems to be much less resilient than previous versions. Much of the old software I downloaded for previous Palms causes a fatal exception. Don't expect to run all the old games or email programs - AOL Mail runs but tends to upset other programs including TomTom.\n\n4. The connections are (inevitably) different from the previous versions so you'll probably need a new modem and a new keyboard.\n\nHaving said that, I'm really fond of it now I'm learning how to treat it.";Tungsten E2 does the job well but it's not all honey
80;41.0;1.0;15.0;i am very disappointed with this product.  i have had it for 7 months, and it just died. it won't turn on no matter what type of reset i do.  it seems that alot of others are having similar problems with this product. also had a problem a few weeks ago of it staying on and using up alll my batteries since i couldnnt turn it off. it turned out to be a problem with the repeat alarm system. if not for these glitches, it could have been a great product. would not re-purchase.;just died

32;43.0;1.0;14.0;After the first synchronization, during setup steps, MY PALM TUNGSTEN E2 HAS MISSED PART OF ITS SCREEN IMAGE. Hard reset doesn't recover that and, as I discovered later, it is a well known problem.\n\nPalm support is a joke. Sometimes you don't have any reply and, when you have, they just follow a limited script to solve limited problems. ONE OF WORST SUPPORT SERVICES I HAVE EVER SEEN. It is worse than Brazilian or Chilean support services.\n\nGuessing that the problem probably is hardware-related was the best help given by Palm e-mail support.  Now, I should contact Telephone Technical Support. Since I'm not currently at US, and local Palm support doesn't accept US warranties, call US support implies an international Phone Call. Important to know, after 90 days from purchase, PALM TELEPHONE TECHNICAL SUPPORT CHARGES A FEE OF $25 per incident.\n\nAt this time, I have to options: THROW IT OUT or spend more money with expensive international phone calls and, probably, international shipping to send my new and unused Palm Tungsten E2 back to US.\n\nThis is my first and, probably, last experience with palm products. I have spent my money buying a product that never worked and Palm support has been pushing all problems on me. I have a HP Jornada which has almost 10 years of use and still working.\n\nMy opinion about Palm Tungesten E2? Definitively, DO NOT BUY IT!;DON'T BUY IT
71;44.0;5.0;14.0;I replaced an old Sony Clie with this and I am very happy.  1st off it is 1/2 the thickness of the old one, has a nicer look and a heavier stylus, and a more solid feel when writing in the graffitti area.  The memory is huge and doesn't erase when the battery runs out.  The unit holds its charge really well.  Customizing the buttons and favorites was very easy.\n\nI was a bit concerned about the problems some noted when installing and having incompatibility with a previous version of Palm software. I am pleased to report installing was a breeze and all my old contact and schedule info loaded automatically.  My photos in Sony PictureIt! did not load, but the pre-installed program was easy to use and in a few minutes I had my photos on board.\n\nI never used bluetooth or WiFi before but it was simple to hook into a wireless network. The unit looks for the network for you, you don't have to know an IP address or anything else fancy.  Very cool.\n\nIt took a bit to get used to Graffitti 2, in other words the change from writing all CAPS to writing all lower case, and writing the actual letters and not special keystrokes.  Once I had learned to old one it was pretty fast.  But this is probably easier for new folks to learn.;Big improvement over Clie
94;45.0;1.0;14.0;Its a great little device but I have never been able to get the bluetooth to work with my spint phone. Now at just over 120 days my connector in the bottopm of the palm has failed. Palm will not repair or replace the unit. I paid $25 to find out I need to buy a refurbished unit for $150, nearly the full retail price. Beware of the lousy 90 day warranty !;beware Palms limited warranty
30;46.0;1.0;13.0;I have 3 palm devices, two have failed out of warranty.  The latest my Tungsten E2 had a speaker failure 16 days past the meager 90 day warranty - cost to repair $149 plus $35 web charge (more than I paid).  Go look it up yourself.  My Tungsten E had a power switch fail within 1 year.  I can't afford to buy a new one every year can you?  I don't think Palm knows the magnitude of their quality problem because no one bothers to repair out of warranty items.  I am never buying Palm again.;A pile of junk
50;47.0;5.0;13.0;The E2 replaced my Palm M105 after 4 years of trouble-free service. I have had this device for about a year and never had a problem. I have not even had to recalibrate it yet! It charges in the sync cradle and has never once had the batteries discharge. I tried using it for music, but it does not do this very well compared to an iPod or MP3 player (sound is fine though). The main drawback is the file conversion and loading process is not simple. It is also too big to be a useful MP3 player in my opinion. I didn't buy it (or my cell phone) to be a music player, so no big deal for me! :-)\n\nBottom line - It is a great PDA and it syncs flawlessly out of the box with my Outlook calendar and Contacts on my PC.\n\nNOTE: I do reccomend buying the optional aluminum case from Palm to protect it though. I have dropped my Palm twice when trying to juggle too many things and the case has saved it!;Works great as a PDA, reasonable price, no problems!
53;48.0;2.0;13.0;"I loved this device out of the box - it had everything I needed, with good interface and efficent features.  It synced well with Outlook Express and the bluetooth function was seamless.\n\nIt died after 6 months, and palm's support to tell me to send it in to have it ""serviced"" (160.00) with no guarantees of it being returned in working condition.\n\nTo make a very long story short, the battery was fried.  I did not charge it abnormally nor did I ever misuse the PDA in a manner for which it was unintended.  Palm does not sell replacement batteries, but I imagine that the ""service"" would have simply involved replacing the faulty battery.  Please note that a replacement battery is NOT available from Palm.\n\nAfter this happened, I went online and found that the same thing had happened to a number of users.  While the majority of users have not had a problem with their device, I would beware buying this model as it seems that a small percentage happen to arrive as lemons.";Buyer Beware
55;49.0;2.0;13.0;I was very happy with the device until it stopped working after only six months. Fortunately I backed up my information regularly and so didn't lose any. Now I am faced with the prospect of buying a new PDA. I'm sad to say the new one is unlikely to be a Palm. Manufacturers must be able to balance economical prices with reliability. What's the point of giving you low prices if you have to replace the units often.\n\nMakes no sense to me.;Lasted only six months
66;50.0;1.0;13.0;I bought this as my first palm in October and was very happy for the first couple of months.  Then it was like it developed a mind of it's own -\n\nReminder alarms going off for no reason - - and no way to shut them off - - it just beeps until IT decides to stop.\n\nButtons completely unresponsive - won't turn on, won't shut off - - sometimes.\n\nSometimes it will turn on but in a diffrent application than what I attempted to access.\n\nWhen accessing the calendar, it will sometimes start fast forwarding past every day and won't stop until it has run through several minutes.\n\nThe stylus may or may not work to access programs.\n\nCustomer service?  Forget it.  Their recommendation is to buy a new one, and that is also the recommendation of service techs at Best Buy and others.  I may have been behind the times with a paper-type Franklin Planner, but at least I was in control!;If I could rate this a negative number, I would.
15;51.0;5.0;12.0;"Bought this device to use for a new job that I have just started. Could not be happier with the unit I received. One thing that I will complain about - when I bought the unit, I also bought one of the Palm 2GB SD memory cards. Only to find out that this particular unit (E2) can't use that large an expansion card. So I ended up returning the 2GB card and buying two 1GB cards instead. I also bought the book, ""How to Do Everything with Your Palm Powered Device"" - which I found to be very helpful in minimizing my learning curve. I originally bought this device to do the standard business sort of things, but I must confess that since discovering that you can use it to read eBooks AND play MP3s - I now have a hard time going somewhere without this thing tagging along.\n\n2-23-2009, Just an update to my original posting... I've been using my E2 now for the past 18 months or so on a daily basis... and it's still running fine.";Great Gizmo
81;52.0;1.0;13.0;There is a problem with the E2, after some time, for me it was 6 months, it just stops working.  No matter what type of reset you perform the unit will not turn on.  Leave the unit for a week or disconnect the battery and something resets and it starts working again.  There are many people having the exact same problem, however Palm takes no responsibility for this defect and blames the problem on 3rd Party Apps.  I have an extended warranty but I am waiting for the E2 to be obsolete before I act on it, I don't want my unit replaced with another defective unit.  It's a good pda for the money, when it works it does what it is supposed to do.  Until this defect is fixed I would not recommend the E2.  And since I have been disappointed by Palms customer support I cannot recommend any of their products.;Tungsten E2 won't turn on
105;53.0;2.0;13.0;"I bought my E2 on May as a replacement for a Tungsten T, which was great in terms of design and functionality, until it developed a progressively worsening calibration failure, which rendered it of no use, a problem I have read about in several reviews of that model. In spite of the bad experience with the T, I decided to give Palm another chance, and I bought the E2 though Amazon, just swallowing the high price for a device that does the same or less than a model two or more years older (OK, it has more memory, but no voice recorder). Certainly the design is stylish, the screen is bright and crisp, and the software is well designed. Nevertheless, again the hardware turned out to be a fiasco: just after 4 months of moderate use the audible high frequency hiss and an intermittent failure of the speaker (which left me without my alarm clock) appeared. I could live with that, but now the touch sensitive screen just stopped working; the buttons do work, but it is impossible to enter data, open applications or do anything. After a hard reboot, I just get to the calibration screen ""Tap the center of the target"" which switches from one corner to the other after touching any point in the screen...basically, it's dead.... (my impression of Palm service, after reading the comments of my fellow Palm-owners discourages me of any attempt of reaching them, especially from outside the US). I came to the conclusion that the Palm concept and design of its machines and the bundled software is great, but that the actual machines are unreliable to the point that makes buying them a bad choice, unless you treat them as basically disposable devices, with half-lives of few months. Of course the Life Drive looks impressive, but I am not willing to risk $500 for a toy that will last a couple of months. Definitely the E2 was my last Palm; now I start my quest for a new PDA.";Good concept - terrible hardware
110;54.0;4.0;13.0;I bought this to replace an old Handspring Visor Platinum that I used (it is still in use  by my wife).  I wasn't interested in bells and whistles like multimedia players and I don't need huge storage because that old visor with 8MB of ram was large enough.  After looking at all the Palms, the E2 seemed to be the current sweet-spot for the cheap price (maybe $150 USD after rebates) and useful features.\n\nThe upsides:  After about a month of use, I like it.  The screen is really great and very easy on the eyes.  The build is solid feeling and the stylus is excellent.  The battery life seems good (still wish it just used user replaceable batteries like the Handspring did).  The included PIM apps are more than adequate and the fact that I won't lose my data if I forget to recharge it is great.  The bluetooth works as advertised, with a bit of finagling, and I have it syncing over BT to Mac OS X addressbook (really great) via isync and everything else to palm desktop (don't like iCal).  I've tried the mp3 player and it does, indeed, play mp3's.  Hooray.  Basically, it does everything I needed and some extra neat tricks too.  I especially like the writing notes on the screen (I'm a chemist, so that means I can jot ideas for reactions down when I think of them).\n\nThe downsides (or, why 4 stars and not 5):  Graffiti 2 takes some getting used to and I still think graffiti 1 was more accurate, if less intuitive.  The Mac OS support just isn't as good as it should be (palm desktop just barely works in OS 10.4) and I feel that Palm has been neglecting software ever since palmsource was spun off.  That said, I got it to work with some help from the interweb (macosxhints, mostly).;Solid, affordable, useful
46;55.0;1.0;12.0;I received Palm Tungsten E2 from Amazon on May, 2006.  It had battery problem (battery exhausted very faster even unused) from the beginning.  It is dead today.  The screen displayed irregular black shapes, some yellow curves and white.  Even hardware reset could not bring up the PDA.  I visited Palm site and learned that it cost as much to repair as to buy a new one and it only had 90 days warranty. I have Sony Clie SJ22 for over three years and it is still working.  I wonder if the quality difference that Sony is manufactured in Japan while Tungsten is made in China?;Dead after  than 6 months
49;56.0;4.0;12.0;This is a pretty nice PDA if you don't have a lot of things you want to do with it.  The battery life is great and you don't lose data if the battery goes down.\n\nI'm a physician, and I had a lot of programs that I wanted to put on it--looking up reference values, drug programs, etc.  There just isn't memory room for it all.  I had to delete some of the programs that came basic with the E2 to make room for what I deem I absolutely had to use.  This I figure is my own fault since if I had known what I needed, I would have bought a PDA with more memory in the first place.  Live and learn.\n\nOverall it's a nice little product, I just didn't know exactly what I needed.;Pretty good for light usage
62;57.0;3.0;12.0;My old m series black and white was adequate for my needs.  I updated only because it could only be synchronized via serial cable and I grew tired of the black and white screen.  I bought the E2 because I really liked the E1 when it came out.  I really only need a PDA and I have to be able to carry it around where I cannot take a cell phone.  I have a strong tendency to buy this stuff for what I need it for and then use it until it rots as long as it does what I need.\n\nSo the pros:  The color screen is bright and easily read, the stylus is metal instead of plastic, the software is stable and works well,the writing function is at the top of its form, it holds a charge well, and the form factor is good to execellent.  It is a little large in the hand but the screen is larger as well.  The software appears to operate as intended.  Let me also say that I have never had a problem with Palms of any kind.  I have never had stabiltiy problems with the OS.  I have had my m series version for years now and it functions as usual.  I also use Bluetooth almost exclusively for synchronization and have never had a problem.\n\nThe cons:\n\n1.  The E2 is fairly expensive and frankly adds little more than an expense tracking feature over my very old PDA.\n\n2.  The stylus has a screw off top which has, of course, screwed off.  I later found it in my chair.\n\n3.  The expense tracking feature does not integrate with Quicken or Microsoft Money.  I found it easier to just keep my receipts and then enter them at the end of the day rather than enter everything into the PDA.  If it integrated with Quicken this would have been a godsend.\n\n4.  It is obsolete.  I knew that when I bought it but it was priced right and had only what I need.  This will be my last Palm.  I guess I have been a satisfied customer, but with the new technology and my changing personal work environment, I will move on.\n\n5.  Finally,  these devices have been fairly expensive.  Although some needed features are/were available thru third party software vendors, I have frankly never been interested.  The basics should come with the machine.  There were, for me, some deficiencies such as basic Gantt charts and scheduling.;Adequate PDA
44;58.0;1.0;11.0;I thouhght this was a great handheld when I first got it, but after two months I found it dead one morning.  None of the recommended procedures revived it.  I sent it back to Palm and after a week and half it was returned.  It worked for 2 weeks and then it died again.  I told Palm tech support I wanted a new one since this is obiously defective.  They refused to give me a new one and said they would fix this again.  The cost of using this device goes up considerably when you consider that all the time you spend on the phone with these people is on your nickel. They do not have an 800 number. Then there is the cost of shipping it back to them (they do not pay for return shipping) And finally there is the inconvenience of being with out the device for the week and a half that it takes to fix it.  Between service and reliability issues, I would recommend buying a handheld from anonther company.;Unreliable handheld
56;59.0;1.0;11.0;Never got a chance to try the product because the Tungsten E2 that I received from Amazon had a European adaptor rather than US one in it. Palm said that resellers (like Amazon) can repackage, and therefore the issue is with them, not Palm. Nothing on the web-blurb or the package indicated that this was not for US -- probably just a freak accident -- but heads up -- if it happens to you, just go through Amazon's return policy and hope for better next time. So I may actually wind up loving the E2 -- but I am annoyed with the glitch.;beware -- wrong ac charger in my order
82;60.0;1.0;11.0;"DO NOT BUY\n\nPalm was mediocre, but workable at first. Pros were that it had a nice screen (at first) and good battery life.\n\nCONS-aside from the fact it resets itself several times per day, the screen stopped working shortly after buying it. It was unreadable, with multicolored stripes through the screen. They also will not ship you a replacement in advance unless you pay an extra $40 (if you bought a palm to manage your schedule, chances are you can't wait several weeks to mail it in, have it repaired, and get it back, right?).\n\nAfter getting the repair, a few months passed, the warranty expired, and the screen broke again. This time it stopped working all together. Palm wanted over $100 to repair it (a month out of warranty). The repair was more than 1/2 the cost of just buying a new one!\n\nSince I did not plan on buying a new version of a model that broke twice and had horrible customer service, I looked for help in the Palm online forums at their website.\n\nSearching for help with ""Tungsten E2 won't turn on"" I found out many other users have the same problem. So far, around 90 other posts by people with the same problem.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Palm has a defect in its product, but has horrible customer support and will not acknowledge it. So a flaw in its production may cost you over $100 for a repair. True, most people won't have the same problem, but would you buy a car from a company that covered up it's defects and made the consumer pay for it rather than fixing it?";Screen stops working after warrantee expires
88;61.0;5.0;11.0;My Advice to all of you guys is too be careful about you battery Level. It may say 100% when it is charging but it is based on the voltage of power coming from the battery. So when you charge it up the voltage jumps to a high rate. So you should really be charging you Palm for about 2-3 hours if it is at about 20-40% Battery. Just charge it overnight while you sleep. Other advice is to put all aplications and games on your card instead of the internal hard drive. Because then if there is any errors just remove the smart card and then it should be back to normal. This player has worked fine for me and I bought it from Best Buy on December, 31st 2005;Some Advice
7;62.0;5.0;5.0;"I have had Palm devices since they first came out.  I currently have a desktop PC, 2 laptops, and 2 iPads.  I have tried to get away from the Tungsten 2E for for years but NOTHING does what they do nearly a well as they do it. They are clearly the best appointment, calendar, contact list around. You will never be late for an appointment again.  No iPad app on my $600 dollar iPad will quickly setup a repeating appointment in a complex manner like: the the 2nd Sunday every other month.  No app will start to notify me with a beep 1 day, 1 week, 1 hour, or  minute before the appointment or task and continue to beep me every 5 or ten minutes until I acknowledge it and either silence it with one touch or put it on snooze to remind me again.\n\nSuch a system is only good if you keep it with you, so you have it as soon as you commit to a new task and enter it immediately. The Tungsten can always be in a shirt pocket or purse my iPad cannot be. If you forget it, when you finally retrieve it, there it is beeping every 5 minutes for your appointment.  No iPad app will do that.\n\nIt has a great ""To do list"" with priority rankings, great software so you can enter everything with a keyboard and sync it to your Tungsten.  If you ever run over it with a car, get another, re-sync it and never miss a beat.  This brings me to durability.  I have dropped then hundreds of times and always cringe but never did more than scuff them up.  I have dropped one into a storm drain grate, washed them in a front loader with laundry, dropped one in my Lilly pond and salvaged them all after drying them out.  One I warped with too much heat because I got impatient and forgot to go back and check on it while drying it out.  I was still able to hot sync it and buy another.\n\nThey have great battery life.  If I was going out of town for less than a week, I never took my charger.  I could go on and on but I will jump to the limited short-comings.\n\nThe Cons: They are older technology so less ebooks and less sharing of data, no surfing the internet, no email, etc.  They have one notorious flaw where the touch screen can get so out of whack that you cannot calibrate it.  This does not happen often.  When it does just let it run down by running some function non-stop, then recharge it.";They are simply indispensible - The best at what they do!

43;64.0;2.0;10.0;"October 2006:  My Tungsten E, which was very satisfactory, was showing signs of battery failure so I opted for the E2.  I'm sorry I did not buy the TX which has a faster processor.  The E2 has non-volitile memory and a different file system.  It is so slow that it may take 4 seconds to turn on or to change programs.  I often get an ""out of memory"" message.  PalmOne did give me good tech support on this.  I have to do a warm reset.  The good news here is that the stylus that comes with the unit will work to do the reset on the back.\n\nToday, the E2 failed to do a Hot Sync or to turn on.  I finally tried the reset, and that solved the problem.  The PalmOne site shows that getting close to the 500 number of files limit will create problems.  Fortunately, I have less than 200 files.\n\nOther than speed between programs and the need to reset about once a week, the E2 is doing everything my E did, and just as well.  If you haven't tried the Palm Sudoku from Astraware, you're missing a most efficient way to play the game electronically.\n\nUpdate 03-01-07:  I got tired of how slow the E2 is to respond to simple tasks like turning off and on, changing programs, and syncing, so I bought a Palm TX.  This led to difficulties in getting TX software to work on my Windows XP systems.  I conquered the problems which you can read about in my review on the Palm TX.  I'm giving my E2 to a 6th grader who likes Sudoku.  I wish I had bought the TX in the first place!";Tungsten E2 is slow

Ever since I recieved this Palm, it's been nothing but trouble.\n\nThe specs say that it can synchronize with Outlook, but it never worked for me.  I called customer support (which, like most companies these days, is located in India) and they told me I need to reinstall Outlook on my PC.  It didn't work, so I was forced to use the Palm Desktop software that came with the unit.\n\nPalm Desktop was reliable in maintaining my daily calendar, but more problems arose when I tried to transfer photos from my PC to the handheld.  I called customer service and they had no idea what the problem was.  I'm still awaiting a callback.\n\nMeanwhile, I am considering returning the unit to the store from which it was purchased or at least trying to exchange it for another product if a return is not possible.\n\nSince my Tungsten E2 has such inconsistent performance, I suggest purchasing a less expensive unit like the Zire and replacing it at soon as it becomes unreliable.;Very Disappointed
18;67.0;2.0;9.0;I like the Palm handhelds in general and have relied on them for years and this one promised a nice combination of features at a relatively low price.\n\nUnfortunately the device seems to have been rushed to market too quickly.  I spend way too much time fighting two awful aspects of the E2 in particular.  The biggest pain is that the synch cable is the most poorly designed interface I have ever used on any device, it is almost impossible to keep it plugged in while it is synching.  That alone makes the device useless to me on many days.\n\nThe other pain is that the new memory feature, while it is a wonderful idea, is not quite ready for prime time.  Many otherwise reliable applications crash with the new memory subsystem.  It isn't fatal, since the device does successfully keep its memory after the crash, but it is disconcerting and a frequent waste of time.\n\nOne odd thing, I've taken this unit back several times because of a high pitched whine that it makes whenever it is turned on.  Every unit I have gotten has this problem for some reason.  I eventually just figured I had to live with it.  Even the demo models in the store make the sound, so I figured it was just a universal or nearly universal problem with the E2 design.;Great idea but went to market too soon with too many problems
111;68.0;4.0;10.0;"I resisted upgrading my Sony Clie T615C, which has been at death's door for a while now, because I thought the transfer of data would be a pain between the two makers. Plus, I didn't need all the extras being touted now - MP3 player, voice recorder, on-board camera, etc., and wasn't looking forward to making the buying ""decision"". I made my decision, though, and am tickled. The color is beautiful, the speed is peppy, and I'm grateful to be joining the 21st century, having just added some songs to my expansion card. P.S. The transfer of data went very smoothly.";I'm a happy camper
112;69.0;5.0;10.0;I had an old palm X that I have used since 1999 and I loved it. But it was black and white and I was wanting to upgrade, didn't really need anything too fancy and this was just the ticket.  I fell in love with it as soon as I opened it and charged it up. The graphics are so clear and it plays my mp3's, holds photos so I can carry pics of my family around with me where ever I go. Best investment I've made in a long time.;tunsten E2
29;70.0;1.0;9.0;I have been a palm user for 8 years starting with the M30 which is still working. But this particular model is permanently stuck on the callibration screen. Palms customer service has gone from mediocre to impossible. Plus this particular model has only a 90 day warranty. Something that is totally unacceptable for a 200+ price tag. To get any service one must buy a service plan. In all of my twenty-five years of electronic use I have never come across a more blaten excuse for bad workmanship than this company has. For my next handheld I'm going with a different brand.;Please don't buy this.
31;71.0;5.0;9.0;I bought this to replace paper calendar and agenda. It's easy to use. Good back light and color. It comes with enough internal memory, you don't have to buy extra memory(card) immediatly. I still don't need it.\n\nIt's very handy.\n\nI was choosing between the Tungsten E and the E2, but for a few bugs more you can get this newer version. The only difference is the Bluetooth. Maybe you won't use this at the beginning, but you never know.\n\nI also have the Palm Z22. It's also very good. It just don't support Excel and Word. Also doesn't have an extension slot, although the internal memory still has enough space, you never know if you would need more later. For the rest it's almost the same as the Tungsten E2.;Reccomended, the price is good for what you get
72;72.0;5.0;9.0;"I have had absolutely not a single complaint about the E2 thus far, and I have been using it for a little over four months now.\n\nI purchased this machine to upgrade from a Sony Clie NX70V that I found very useful for many years, but which had features I just did not find myself needing to use - like a voice recorder, digital camera, and even a moving images recorder (all stored on inserted sony stick memory). But it was the battery life that was the most frustrating thing about it - see below for more.\n\nWhen I was looking for a palm to purchase, however, my main concern was battery life. I only use the thing to look at documents, contacts, ebooks, etc. Very little text input per se - that is done on my laptop or in a pinch from a wireless keyboard a friend gave to me for Christmas made by Palm which also works quite nicely. I do not use it for looking at photos or for wireless networking or bluetooth or email or the internet from a palm. It is merely an information organizer.\n\nSo ... I came across the E2 for under $130 in a CircuitCity and bought it. The thing gets over 16 hours of battery life with the things I use it for. I have had no problems with installation, or indeed with anything about the machine since then. I have not had to ""soft boot"" it once, and I use it daily.\n\nThe SD slot holds a 512mb card that easily holds the eBooks I normally access (over 35 volumes of reference material and many novels, non fiction, and daily documents). SD cards are cheap - so this was nice for me.\n\nBut there was one additional thing I was very happy to discover, and that is that it plays MP3 files very nicely. I have had no problems with the Realplayer software whatsoever - all I do is copy the mp3 files from my collection on my laptop to an SD card, put the SD card in and VOILA! a 512mb (or bigger I'd imagine, though I have not purchased any larger SD cards) portable mp3 player! I was very pleased with the sound quality too. AND it goes on like this for over 12 hours - comparable to recent iPods and other mp3 players battery life wise.\n\nI am also thrilled with the flash memory feature. There do some times when one is just away from an outlet for a long period of time and then thing runs out of juice ... although I have not had that happen with the E2 yet, it did happen with my old Clie, and that was a royal pain in the neck. There were, of course tools that came with the machine to ""recover"" from this, and with some ease admittedly, but I still thought a pain in the neck.\n\nSo - I would recommend this to anyone who does simple tasks as I do but who needs long battery life at an affordable price. If you want to do ANYTHING else - look elsewhere.";It does perfectly what I bought it to do!
85;73.0;2.0;9.0;When I reciebed the E2 as a gift I thought nice, i needed a new one (had my PalmV for 5 years). So after i updated the new Palm I was ready to go. I use mine every day, all day, so it got a work out fom day 1. Now the problems 1st it is slower, 2nd, in the middle of writing it freezes and you have to wait for it to catch up, 3rd you cant read it in the sunlight, 4th The battery does not last as long. All in all it has some better features (MP3, bluetooth) than the others but its not all its advertised to be. Actually starts to make me want to look at other brands for a PDA.;Not as good as V
89;74.0;4.0;9.0;"I wanted to update, it's the end of Aug and still no major problems. It did freez up once, I was doing something with the world time zones. I never leave the country, just goes to show, don't mess with things you don't need. The battery holds a charge perfect, and it's been droped a few more times, IN THE CASE\n\nWell my old 515 died so I got myself the E2 just before Christmass. FIRST I HAVE TO SAY. I don't use the thing as an MP3 player, I didn't add all kinds of game software. I use it for SIMPLE buisness tasks. Documents, phone #, appointments, to do list....I also bought an alumuminumum (I can't say it either) case.\nI have droped this thing (in the case) at least half dozen times. It has been left in the truck overnight in Chicago winter. I try not to be too rough on it but I'm clumsy, oh well.\nIt is working fine, and I would recomend it to other people. So far, no ""screeming screen"" no lost data and no problems with sync. GEE I HOPE I DIDN'T JUST CURSE MYSELF !! My 515 worked fine for a little over 2 years, then it wouldn't sync.\nI have come to the conclusion I will need a new one every other year or so, and in the meantime I will SYNC,SYNC,SYNC in case.\nI think if you stick to the basic functions, don't mess with freeware, or other third party software, They work. If you need more then maybe a laptop is best for you...and if you work in the feild, out of your truck, price one of those ""rugged"" laptops, they are about the price of a few dozen palms. Yes they have issues, but at this point, after you do the research it's  up to you to make the desicion.\nOne thing I tell EVERYONE, these things are something people seem to love or hate. If your thinking of buying one, but never used one before, get one of the cheap ones from a different manufacturer. That way if you hate it don't use it your only out 30 or so\nanother update 4/29/07 well it worked up untill a few weeks ago, I left it in my truck in a nice area and in 2 minutes it was gone, jerks,\ngot a second one locally, and it crashed 3 weeks later, see my iolo review, ANYWAY customer service was great got my problems solved in about 45 minutes, and i learned a few other things about the desktop software\nHIGHLY RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT, if you use it\nANOTHER UPDATE 4/7/09 I still got mine! No major problems I wonder if they are still making this thing, I really like mine and I know from past experience I am close to the end of it's life";Mine is still working fine
102;75.0;4.0;9.0;I bought this for it's low price. It's my first ever pda device. I can't help but be impressed with all it does, especially the Excel spreadsheets that I use on the job. However I nearly returned the unit to the store on day 2 because it froze after installing a 3rd party software. I then spent my entire evening on the web learning that there is a micro reset button on the back,etc. Most folks would not be so patient. They really should supply that basic information in the postcard instruction that comes with the device (sheez).\n\nAside from spending 6 hours performing multiple reloads of the E2, and restoring my desktop registry to back out the purchased 3rd party software, English/Spanish Dictionary, I am now beginning to like this unit dispite my sour grapes experience with 3rd party OS compatible software.\n\nI also read on web knowledge bases (while fixing my Fatal Error problem) that many people have problems with 3rd party software. My strong advice is to never install ANY 3rd party software and you will be happy.  The main applications are built-in, such as calendar, contacts, photos, notes, Doc's To Go, etc,, basically everything that you'll ever need. By the way, I don't use music, email,games nor internet access.\n\nIf you could run 3rd party software on this device then I would have given it 5 stars.\n\nI guess it's normal to discard the E2 in 18 months when the battery dies, (ouch!)  however it's fine selling point is it's low price.\n\nFor newbies reading this: I was able to load my 3rd party desktop address book into this device fairly easily, via, desktop Export using 'comma delimiter file type=txt', then Import using the supplied Tungsten software. Took awhile to assign field names, but worth it.\n\nAs a first timer, let me say that I downloaded 4 Excel (MS Works) spreadsheets and it was a snap to do and use on the E2. I also converted a PDF file to basic RTF (rich text format) in WordPad and then downloaded (technically call Hotsync) it too.\n\nApparently, it comes with a scaled down PDF reader and if you want to be able to download 'ANY/ALL' PDF file to the E2, then you need to buy the PDF Pro at at extra cost. I haven't done that yet, so no feedback there.\n\nEven thought the battery will die in 18 months to 2 years, I will have to buy the hard shell case for an extra $40 bucks to put it in my back pocket.  But the basic price is still relatively low.\n\nHere's an update. After 3 weeks, I dropped it and broke the screen. $125 to get it fixed. Naw, just not cost efficient.;Low Price = 4 stars.
16;76.0;1.0;8.0;"I am a very busy facility manager, and I need the Palm operating system (OS).  I believe the Palm OS is superior to any other PDA OS, and I do not have the time to learn something else.  This product is exactly what I need badly, but it is just too expensive to only last from 6 to 18 months.  I am painfully aware of this because my fifth (5th) one of these (always purchased new) just quit.\n\nI do not abuse these units!  I keep them from moisture, shock, and vibration.  All I do is use them gently, a lot. Most of the failures have been related to the beeper which I rely on as a meeting or deadline reminder.  Other failures have been battery related.  The latest failure is the centering procedure for the stylus operation being off "" too high on the display no matter what I do making the alpha-numeric touch screen function impossible to access.\n\nIf this product cost less than $50.00 knowing it will only last for months not years, I may again consider it.  I guess I am saying it is cheap junk only worth $50.00 at retail.\n\nI seriously considered some of the Sharp and Casio models, but I need a program like Documents-to-Go so I can upload my large database of Excel notes which I can search while away from my office.

8;77.0;1.0;5.0;Beware!!!We purchased a Palm Tungsten E2 via Amazon.  The order was fullfilled by Renew Electronics.  This was purchased to replace an older unit that was beginning to fail.  The idea was that since we already had all of our info on the old one and the computer back-up it would be simple to synchronize a new one.  The purchase price was the same that we had paid for the original many years ago which is odd for such a dated item. However, the new unit failed to synchronize with the computer program.  We followed all of the written instructions included with the new unit.  We even went so far as to back up our files, delete the original program and download a newer version.  The new unit still failed to synchronize.  We contacted the seller, explained the problem and also brought up the fact that this new unit had no serial number on the back. They told us that these were surplus units made by Palm for many countries all over the world and that the unit was sold as listed. We again followed all of their intructions.  The unit still failed.  Thank goodness for Amazon.  It was returned with no problem.  We believe that since this unit had no serial number on the back it was probably a foreign knock off.  Apparently Renew Electronics doesn't care where it gets its product.  We would give it 0 stars but that is not allowed.;Beware Tungsten E2
25;78.0;1.0;8.0;My old Tungsten E is beginning to wear out, so I bought an E2. It hot synced one time, when I first started it, but now I get an error message and it does not hotsync. Support answered me promptly, but their suggestion didn't work. I keep trying different things as I get a chance, but so far nothing has worked. It sits in my desk drawer and I'm seriously thinking about taking it apart to see if I can use the buttons from it to repair my old one.\n\nI also have a refirbished Palm TX. It just shuts down when I press hotsync. I even used a different computer, thinking that the programs weren't compatable. But that didn't work either.\n\nKeep your receipts! It does you no good to try and return someting if you don't have your receipts.;Wish I could find a new, old E
33;79.0;5.0;8.0;The Good stuff:  Color, SD Slot, Bluetooth, sound, software selection is great, view videos/pictures/PDF Files without the need for a laptop or cell phone, Great idea for people who tend to forget things or need to write stuff down so they don't forget (Like me!!!), Rechargeable!!, comes on just by hitting one of the 'function buttons'.\n\nThe Bad Stuff:  Flip Cover is kinda cheezy but can be taken off.  These things tend to show fingerprints real well.  Reading PDF's on the tiny screen takes some getting used to.  Playing games/videos from memory or SD Card will eat up the battery.  The HotSync cable end is a bit fragile so if you're too rough you might snap it off if not careful.\n\nOverall, I'm quite happy with it.;BIG Improvement over my old Handspring Visor!!
9;80.0;1.0;5.0;Tungsten E2 was great, would have rated 4.5 UNTIL I bought a new Computer W2, Now NOT Compatible with Win 7!

I would never have purchased the Tungsten E2 if I had known this and there is NO warning on the amazon page for it.;Tungsten E2
93;81.0;3.0;8.0;Received it as a Christmas gift and I regret to say that I am not too impressed. I was hoping that it would have more comprehensive features and be up to date with the latest techno. features. Unfortunately it has not lived up to my expectations. I will say that it is attractive and very easy to navigate though the screens LCD doesn't have the highest resolution;Not Too Impressed
108;82.0;4.0;8.0;"Unfortunately, the E2 comes with a transformer, which makes it unworthy of travel (unless you buy an aftermarket switching power supply).\n\nThey designed the E2 to have seperate data/power connectors, which has its advantages, but then they put a proprietary non-standard data connector on the chassis when they could have gone with a USB connector.  They also used a proprietary non-standard power connector, when they could have gone with a barrel connector that any universal power supply could plug into.  I find it irritating that they did not take advantage of the data/power seperation and use standardized connectors to do away with proprietary cables.  This was a poor design choice; it was probably a choice made by marketing.\n\nThe audio is too hissy to tolerate.  It's a shame, because it's a slick interface, and quite convenient to stash a gig of tunes on an MMC card.  If you don't want to carry a seperate mp3 player, you should pass on this this PDA.  It's too hissy even when the signal is not amplified and you're using quality headphones.\n\nPalm OS 5 is not 100% backward compatible with Palm OS 4.  Some legacy applications will run on the E2 in a degraded state, and other apps will completely crash the device, and force a reset.  Maybe rightly so, but something to be aware of.\n\nThey imposed Graffiti 2 on users that are accustomed to the legacy Graffiti.  There's no reason this could not have been made a selectable option for Graffiti version.\n\nThose are just minor annoyances, and the E2 also has some strong points, but I don't care to take the time to go into it.  Overall I find the E2 satisfactory, hence my 4 star rating.";Connectors are poorly designed - a minor annoyance
14;83.0;5.0;7.0;This seems to be one of the few palms on the market. Too many people wanting Blackberries/Treo.  I had no use for a phone/palm combo, so I opted for this.\n\nPROS: You can put MS Word, Excel and PDF files(conversion step first, but it is simple) on it.  The whole setup is very user friendly. Good battery life. Volume for MP3's is good considering the size of the speaker. You can beam files, games, appointments from one Palm to another in close proximity.\n\nCONS:  The largest SD card that can be used is a 1GB per the Palm site.  I went and got a 2GB card and then found out it wouldn't work. Also, the flap that it came with will work, but you are better off going and getting the Slim Leather Case or Hard Case for it.\n\nThe only other thing is that it doesn't come with a WiFi card.  However, this can be easily solved by buying one.\n\nAll in all the Tungsten E2 is a good overall Palm.;Terrific
23;84.0;5.0;7.0;Great little PDA, fun/easy to use for all our personal and business needs. I am on call 24/7, and the note writing function is convenient where ever I might be. My husband gave his smaller PDA to his daughter, thinking his Q phone would take the place. He found the Palm E2 ease of use to be an advantage....I gave him one as present, now we each have our own. As a note, the portable keyboard accessory has been handy as well. The Sync process is easy/convenient between PDA/Computer or Computer/PDA.;Palm Tungsten E2-Great Product
34;85.0;4.0;7.0;The Tungsten E2 is a good choice for a basic PDA at a reasonable price. But the sychronization connection system leaves a lot to be desired. The handheld is plugged in a computer with a USB2 cord that has a very fragile-looking plug on the handheld end. In addition the plug has to be inserted just so otherwise it won't sync with the computer. There is an optional cradle that can be purchsed but appearently it is only available in a $50 kit that includes adaptors for foreign voltages--a kit that costs a quarter of the price of the E2. In general the plug-in system needs a redesign.\n\nThe E2 comes with a flimsy flip cover. Aftermarket covers or cases should be purchsed for better protection.;Nice basic PDA but the sync system stinks
37;86.0;5.0;7.0;I bought the Tungsten E2 to replace my Franklin Day Planner of 13 years, and so far...so good!  I am still finding out new features and ways to use it, but have been quite satisfied.  Some other reviews had me apprehensive, suggesting charging problems, etc., but a relative's recommendation prompted me to go ahead.  I have found the battery life to be better than expected -- Having used it for three weeks, I have had to charge it weekly, with fairly heavy usage over that time.  From my experience, as a new Palm user, it has been easy to adapt to and use.  One of these days, I will get around to using the software that came with it, in order to get deeper into the available features and uses.  I'm glad I made the purchase!;My first Palm
39;87.0;5.0;7.0;After a few months of using the Palm Tungsten E2, I would recommend anyone thinking about getting one to do so. It has performed flawlessly since day one. I would also recommend getting a hard case, and screen covers - since the screen is quite delicate.\n\nBe aware that I first bought a 2GB SD memory card for it, but the E2 only supports up to 1GB SD cards - which is plenty of memory for most people.\n\nPictures look great, but video doesn't render well on the E2.\n\nRecommended.\n\nJames\n\nLong Beach, CA;Great PDA - no problems
40;88.0;1.0;7.0;When the palm works, it's great. I've grown to depend on it to keep my life in order. After having it for 2 short months, it simply stopped working. The trouble shooters gave it their best shot but the bottom line is it caused me great inconvience. I ended up having to package it (my cost) and send it to be repaired instead of being replaced. I've been without it for 2 weeks and counting, the lastest update on the repair is over a week old despite the website stating repair info updated frequently each day. I have no idea when to expect it back.\n\nI'm so disappointed, I feel that I've wasted my money in purchasing this Palm. Amazon takes no responsibility for a defective product. I will probably not buy another Palm or use this site again.;It died a quick painful death
41;89.0;3.0;7.0;Despite all the research/reviews and cross checks to make sure I made the best choice for my media needs, I missed the biggest issue of hot sync compatibility. Evidently, it's a problem that drives many owners nuts. I've gone to product support, user forums and done all the recommended fixes: drivers, rear ports, all the ports, com checks, etc. Tried it on 3 different systems of 2 different desktops with Win XP, home edition, svc pack 2, Win 2000, and still can't get the computer and the Palm to connect. (All requirements met but a small percentage of owners can't sync) Updated with the software CD provided, oneline version 4.1.4E and still can't fix the issue. This beautiful device is absolutely useless if the owner can't get the desktop to transfer information. This was my Christmas gift that is rapidly becoming a white elephant and I may ultimately have to swallow the loss in restock/shipping and cut my losses. I had 2 previous Palms, last one was V and it has provided a lot of happy usage as an electronic text storage for lessons/books and such at only 2MB. Thought upgrading would be a happy advance but it's just not connecting. So next time, I'm finding someone with a PDA first to test my computer before buying an upgrade. Amazon service was absolutely wonderful. Hot Sync issues are just flummoxing me and makes me sad that I can't get this tool to work. The desktop loaded new code, pictures, and PDFs and it was very exciting until the roadblock on the sync cable. No way to patch up with previous versions/tools. :+(;Hot Sync Issues
45;90.0;4.0;7.0;"I replaced a very old Handspring with the E2 (I have to give it to the Handspring though, it is still going strong, my wife now is using it) but this is a review about the E2.  It is much thinner and lighter, which is nice.  I use it heavily and am quite impressed with battery life.  I was a bit skeptical with the rechargeable battery as opposed to replaceable AAA's like my Handspring had.  I was also basing that opinion on Consumer Reports reviews regarding battery life, however, I must say the longevity even with heavy use is very good.\n\nRegarding other features, it is very versatile and user-interface is very good.  I use my E2 to double as an MP3 player and it works great.  I do wish it was compatible with a larger SD card--it was rather difficult to discern this even from Palm's website.  Suffice to say, the max is a 1 GB card.  One minor complaint, and it is minor.  I used to use a ""floating event"" a lot on my Handspring, for something that you wanted to do that day but if you did not get it done, it would carry over to the next day in the datebook.  There is no way to even set up an event like this is Palm's calender software.  It is a minor gripe, but I still miss that feature.  Overall, though, this is a good product which stands up to heavy use.";a nice slim handheld that is quite capable
59;91.0;3.0;7.0;First i need to say the battery life is HORRIBLE. My  husband has and E2 and his is wonderful.\n\nSecond i got it on mother's day 2006 and on 7/20 the on off button caved in.

I like that can put a ton of information in the contacts.\n\nBut to spend $200 plus on this........um no.;Eh, It's Ok
79;92.0;4.0;7.0;"UPDATE: I installed the Phone Link updater from Palm's web site, and can use my Nokia 6102's (WAP) net connection to surf the net.  Keep in mind how much data you have -- real net access will eat up, say, 5MB *really* quickly, so keep track of this unless you want huge phone bills (or just get unlimited net access).\n\nI also bought a 1GB SD card (Kingston; it was $30.15 on Amazon -- great deal!); it works perfectly.\n\nGreat PDA.  I bought mine mostly to keep track of homework, since my old PDAs (2 Visors and a Sony Clie) were dead or dying.  After months of deliberation between the E2 and the z22, I picked the E2.  I figured that it would hopefully last a while, so I'd get the better of the two.\n\nI love it.  The screen is *beautiful*.  When I look back at my Clie SL10, I wonder how I was able to stand using it as my regular PDA.  Anyway, yeah... great screen.  It comes with a photo viewer, which works well.  A tad slow flipping through photos on the memory card, but that might just be my memory card (it isn't a particularly fancy one; I think it was the cheapest one they had).\n\nThe speaker is... amazing.  It's better than the ones on my iBook.  It actually has midrange and a bit of bass.  There's a headphone jack, so you can use headphones and everything, but it's actually feasible to fill a (small) room with the sound from an E2.  I use RealPlayer for music most of the time; it can multitask.  Occasionally, when another app accesses the card, the music skips or cuts out for a second, but they's expected.  Frankly, I'm amazed that it *can* multitask.  When I want louder music, I use TCPMP (The Core Pocket Media Player).  It's a 3rd-party, free, open-source media player that also plays videos.  Yup... the E2 can do video.  I haven't tried RealPlayer for video yet.  And yes, you can play two MP3s at once (RealPlayer in the  background, TCPMP in the foreground.)\nAs for other stuff... it comes with Documents To Go 7, with native document support, which means that you don't need to convert documents -- just stick them on the memory card.  I haven't actually used this yet, so no word on how it keeps formatting, but if it's anything like it does normally, it's probably better than Pocket Word on a Pocket PC.\nIt has Bluetooth; I haven't tried it, as I have nothing else to try it with, but it does work (paired it with someone's Motorola RAZR to test it.)\nOn the topic of connecting to phones -- I haven't managed to get net access via IR via my Nokia 6102 (Cingular), but it can use the Dialer app to dial my phone.  So I can dial any number in my Palm's address book... excuse me... ""Contacts"".  [goes off and mutters about how Palm changed all the app names to fit Outlook].  Oh yeah -- I can beam photos from my phone (it's a camera phone) to my Palm.  And then put them on my computer.\nI'm on OS X; Palm Desktop works well; it's still basically Claris Organizer.  There's a ""Send To Handheld"" droplet that converts photos, videos, etc. to send to the Palm.  Oddly enough, it seems to be able to install stuff in the middle of a HotSync.  Last time I checked, it wouldn't let you queue up anything to install during a HotSync.  Not with this -- it'll go and install it!  Really cool.\nAnyway, great PDA.  If you're really into music, I'd recommend getting a 512MB or 1GB SD card; it doesn't come with one.  (I'm using the 64MB one I bought for my HP49g+ calculator... not nearly enough space for music.)\nIt comes with a universal screen protector, which, after cutting to the correct size marked on the plastic backing, will be very useful for people like me who are worried about scratching their brand new PDA.\nOne thing to take into consideration is the warranty.  It's only 90 days.  $50 at Palm's online store will get you a 1-year warranty that includes one screen replacement.  If you register the E2 before you buy it, they give you (or at least they gave me) a 20% off coupon, making it $40.  Just keep this in mind...\nOverall, excellent PDA.  Haven't had any problems.  It does everything I need, and probably 20 billion things I have no use for.  It's cool.";Excellent PDA
83;93.0;2.0;7.0;"I own this device since 6 months ago.\nIt's the first palm pilot I ever owned but I had a few pocket pc's I played with for a few days.\nAlthough I would prefer now a pocket pc type of device, this would be a decent handheld if it would communicate with the PC in a better way: its current way of doing it it's by so called ""HotSync"", an old fashioned way of installing new software and backing up your data.\n\nThe problem I got: the PC won't start the sync process, so it's the third time I uninstall and re-install back the handheld utility (on my desktop PC). Pretty painful and frustrating process overall.\n\nOther minuses I would mention:\n-lacking of a better wireless capability then the supplied bluetooth (you must pay at least $80 to add wireless 802.11b and you won't be able to use a memory card at the same time with wireless)\n-the supplied charger is good only for US, so when I traveled to Europe I couldn't use my palm (I could have bought a travel charging adapter for extra $25 but I ran out of time as they didn't sell one at local BestBuy, CircuitCity nor RadioShack).\n-the device heats up pretty much if it's used a little more intensively (I would say playing a game for over 10 min) and loses power pretty quickly (as far as I know the heat is somewhat normal from a battery but it's what it damages a rechargeable).\n\nIf you are in the market for a new handheld consider this one only if you are budget restricted and you get a very good deal (Amazon usually offers one of the best available).\n\nUpdate as of 02/07/2006\nI think I was negatively influenced by the hotsync problem when writing the review. I would give the item just a star more for the following positive things I forgot to mention:\n\n-sleek and sturdy* design:\npeople are telling me that the item look nice, and it felt a couple of times on a hard floor, but the only obvious things were some very light scratches (not noticeable at this time anymore)\n\n* I would compare it also to the hp ipaq I played with, which had a damaged central button after only a few months, and the 2 rubber grips on the sides were falling apart.\n\n-then the display didn't get even a scratch. this compared to the Dell axim X51 (the top model from Dell) of a friend of mine, which got plenty of scratches just from the stylus, after a few months of use.\nHe had to buy protecting foil ($30 a pack), I'm only using regular lens cleaner once in a while, when the display gets dirty of fingerprints and other stuff.\n\nUpdate as of 04/25/2006\n\nI purchased a laptop with bluetooth capability (an HP with Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network w/Bluetooth), and although I'm a patient guy and computers savvy, it was impossible for me to browse the web on my Palm or to Hotsync it via bluetooth.";Messy HotSync
84;94.0;3.0;7.0;I bought this to replace an M500 that eventually broke, and am disapointed. It is less stable, has more sync problems, and is generally less robost as a pim manager. Yes, there are some neat new functions, but they are mostly gloss, and don't augment the basic tasks I want it for, or make up for the fact that the basic tasks are now more difficult.\n\nI wish Palm still made the M500.;All in all, a step down from previous palms
106;95.0;2.0;7.0;"Nice Palm product, but:\n\n- horrible reliability and warranty support; big probability of being stuck with non-working device.\n\n- humongous USA-only power adapter means you can't use your PALM when traveling abroad.

10;96.0;4.0;5.0;The Palm Tungsten E2 is a very efficient and reliable personal data assistant.  This PDA has served me well for many years, but recently it  became erratic.  After much trial and error I sort of fixed it.\n\nSeveral years ago the medical schedule that was prescribed for me  became very difficult for me to manage.  Frequently I would forget a dose of medicine or overlook a required activity.  After numerous missed doses, my doctors asked me to get a PDA.  My occupational therapist recommended this Palm PDA to help me manage my medicine and regimen.\n\nIn January  my PDA suddenly became unreliable.  Sometimes it would fail to reminded me of a medicine time.  Frequently it would sound the alarm at the wrong time or day.  When I notified my therapist, she suggested I get another PDA .  She also informed me that many of her patients had the same problem.  She determined that the PDA was not programmed for 2010.\n\nAfter some thought, I decided to change the date on my PDA to 1999.  The calendar for 1999 and 2010 are exact duplicates.  My Palm now works well again - as long as I can ignore the year on its calendar.;Needs 2010 Adjustment
11;97.0;1.0;5.0;"There are no 64-bit USB drivers for this, so if you want to synchronize with your computer and you have a 64-bit operating system (as on dual core computers), you can only do so using an EXTREMELY slow IR or Bluetooth connection. Start the synchronization before you go to bed; if you're lucky it will be done when you get up. Palm has had over four years to produce 64-bit drivers, and they haven't. The only conclusion is that they don't care about their customers.";Palm doesn't care about you
13;98.0;4.0;6.0;"I just received my palm a few days ago. Ok actually last night. Just thought that I'd pop in here, the place that I ordered it from (I ordered it new from amazon. I recommend it) and give a short and concise review.\nFirst of all, know that I really do like this palm. Once you get past the installing process and get comfortable with it. To any newbies out there, there's a few things that I recommend you doing BEFORE you get your palm.\n 1. order an expansion card with it, or go to the store and get one. You're going to need it if you'll be working with any extra applications like Documents to Go, Music, etc.\n 2. Get a wireless keyboard!! If you are going to be typing anything out on your palm like I do (I ordered it so that I could work; I type long stories and need a REAL keyboard)\n 3. get a cover to go with. Either a leather case or hard case, just go with how much you're going to be handling your pda and how much money you've got to spend. The palm does come with a case, but of course, as usual, its a cheapie so I would say that you should order a new one!\n 4. Enjoy it! Don't let yourself get stressed out when you get the palm. It will probably not live up to your standards for easy to set up and install, sync, etc. But don't worry, if you're at all techie, then you'll get used to it and work out all the kinks. If you're having problems with something, tell someone! Don't just suffer through it. Leave me a comment or go to the palm website. There is a special website that you will be able to find in your installation CD or on the box that is especially for your tungsten E2.\n\nSo go live life, and take the other bits of life with you, in your palm!";My Tungsten E2 is... pretty good actually
17;99.0;1.0;6.0;I hae the palm E and was told that all I had to do was load the palm E2 and it would work in about 10 minutes.  Simple huh!  It would load, it wouldn't sync and it wouoldn't leave my desk top alone.  Kept changing the config.  I sent it back and will keep my Tungsten E until the bugs get worked out.  Amazon took it back without complaints for a full refund.;didn't work
20;100.0;2.0;6.0;"I had thought that the Tungsten line was their top of the line range (now, it seems they only have three products in PDA form).  I was wrong.  Because of hardware problem, I had to ditch my handy Zire 72S (sob) for this machine.  I'm sorry I bought it.\n\nBefore starting in the rant:  the T-E2 is a smart looking machine, it has an MP3 player with a low-end speaker, nonetheless, it has one.  The display is sharp, if a bit over-saturated.  It has a memory card slot, and about 30 mb of RAM.\n\nNow, the tough part.  The machine states that it has 29.7 mb of total space.  That would seem plenty.  But it seems that if you put large apps on it (DateBk5 or DateBk6, French/English dictionary, TealPhone, etc.) that you will find it takes forever sometimes just to switch to another app.  This was never the case with my Zire.  I have literally thought that the machine was hung on numerous occasions.  It is hard to figure out what the pattern is.  But I can now no longer count on being able to have instant access to my data.  Sometimes, I get an error when switching apps, and have to reset.  Why??\n\nTo turn on the machine and go straight into the address book, or any of the four buttons, I find that I have to press the button several times (or maybe I need to wait 15 seconds) before the display comes on.\n\nIn STRIP (the password encryption tool), I find that now I can see the screen updates take place.  Most all apps seem to behave normally once loaded, but they aren't so snappy as they were in my Zire in operation.\n\nI have yet to be able to hotsync to install new software successfully.  While it is doing the ""clean up"" phase, it hangs, and gives me a ""reset"" dialog box.\n\nThis is my fourth Palm OS machine, and it has definitely been the rockiest transition to a new machine.  I can only hope that I can get used to having lower expectations from this, since I can't afford to buy ANOTHER Palm right now.";Unpredictably Slow
21;101.0;2.0;6.0;"My prior experience with Palm was always a little frustrating, but since the device I had worked reasonably well (m515), I overlooked their poor customer service. No longer. My trusty m515 had to be replaced because it went missing, and the E2 looked like a good bet for what I needed. Unfortunately, the happy story ends there.\n\nMy Palm E2 was in warranty when I got the ""grey screen of death"". Palm repaired it. It has happened again, but this time, one month later than the additional 3 months warranty they tacked on (within 7 months: total of two repairs/replacements needed). My option -- $150 to have Palm fix ""my"" problem. I will never buy another Palm. And I won't recommend the devices any longer to my friends and business associates. This company does not back up their products and seems to think they are throw aways. Which is what I'm about to do -- throw it away.";Don't buy this device
24;102.0;5.0;6.0;This PDA doesn't make phone calls, take pictures, or give route directions, but it synchs so much faster, holds its charge so much longer, and has so much more memory than my old model that I am completely happy. Also, I enjoy changing the color scheme on the display (the old model had a black-and-white display).;Just right for my needs
26;103.0;2.0;6.0;Within 3 days of startup the Graffiti 2 help had disappeared and not even a hard restart, wiping all data and third party software, could bring it back.  Because this was a company purchase and I didn't actually start using it as soon as it was bought, the 90 day period of actual technical support had expired.  Never mind that this feature died in just 3 days of use.  I could pay for a technical support call but at this point I'm disgusted with them.\n\nI am leery of this PDA now.  Even with hot syncing and backups I wonder how much else is going to evaporate off it.  While it was nice to have a quick data transfer from my old Palm, I am not so sure I will buy another Palm PDA.  The syncing cable looks likely to die in too short a time, for one thing - it has its contacts exposed to dust and corrosion and just lies on my desk like a naked electrical plug.\n\nSo, think before you buy, and start using it instantly. That way if some supposedly reliable onboard feature quits within days, maybe you can get some help for it.;Disappointing, and don't expect any support
35;104.0;5.0;6.0;I bought this device after two years of trying other devices, including the Blackbery.  By far this is a super product.  I have loaded it with Palm extras as well as a few third party extras and even my Windows Exel spread sheet to do my work on the run.  Very easy to learn and easy to navigate.  I do not use the included cable.  Instead I added a Bluetooth dongle to my computer and it always syncs effortlessly everytime.  Although the more you load into it the longer it takes when you sync.  But what's a few extra seconds when you've saved so much time by having so much information with you all day?;Palm Tungsten E2...GREAT!!
36;105.0;5.0;6.0;After just a couple of days this little Palm has become indispensible to me. Very easy to use and provides tools to help me get organized. Highly intuitive and user-friendly and reliable. Great screen. I actually tried the Palm TX and found it caused me some eyestrain and headaches due to smaller font and the simulated qwerty keyboard having a dark background. I can fly on the Tungsten keyboard but not on the TX. The Tungsten has a very clean and uncluttered display. Excellent little unit. I am glad I bought it.

73;107.0;2.0;6.0;"As usual, Palm doesn't improve with later versions.  The sync and power plugs are much worse than the Tungsten E.  They have plastic tabs and little metal prongs, and to put both in at the same time you have to force them together.  I have had very bad luck with palm service under warranty so now I buy the cheapest I can and consider them ""disposable"".  The Tungsten E2 does nothing to change my mind.  No wonder they have no feedback button on their website, but I did fax them about the plugs.  They are the worst I've ever seen and will break sooner rather than later.  Also, after installing their new software which told me it had deleted some 3rd party programs that might not work, it still wouldn't sync without a fatal error every time.  So their software isn't great, either.  Wish I had another palm platform choice, other than a palm product.";really poor plugs

(I know, you're way ahead of me) everything is erased - on both the desktop and the handheld.  Then I go onto their website and I see lots of people with the same complaint - ""I lost all my data, is there any hope?""  Nope.";Memory Loss Nightmare
19;109.0;1.0;5.0;"BUYER BEWARE!  Read the reviews before considering buying this.  The screws keep falling out on my palm pilot, and I've found that this is a problem that many people have had (just google ""Palm Replacement Screws"").  If you buy this, there's a good chance that you'll be the next person having the exact same issue - so be warned.  It may not seem serious, but screws coming out basically means your unit casing will come off and that leaves the memory and all the important things you write down in your schedule UNPROTECTED.\n\nWhen I contacted them about the issue, I found out what the Palm company was really all about.  That is, getting your money and not looking back.  Instead of admitting that their is a serious design flaw with their product, and doing what they could to rememdy the situation....they figure this is another way they ought to try and add to their profit margin.  Not very smart.  I'm not even asking them to apologize for their imcompitant case designs (which would help them save face imho).  What really gets me is that theres enough people that have this problem for it to be clearly visible to the higher ups, and some executives at the company actually made the decision that they would trade 75 cents in screws for the loss of their company name.  And If the guys running the PALM company are idiots, then it's time to look elsewhere.\n\nI can't believe they wouldn't just ship out replacements and try to fix the product designs.  But as I reseacrch the net to try and find some decent replacement screws for my own unit in the meantime, I just keep finding more and more stories of good people (who don't have problems with screws coming out of other small electronics btw) who are in the same pathetic PALM ownership boat as me.  Am I ever sorry I bought the unit.  Besides the screws, it has reset on me on a number of occasions and luckily I'm religious about backing up data.  Still, you lose some entries and its a major pain.  In fact, I did miss a meeting once because I missed  reentering it after the unit reset and lost data.\n\nWell Palm won't be fattening their margins on me anymore, and I hope you heed the warning I give.  I am in the market for a new Handheld, but I'll NEVER allow myself to get swindled by them again.  They could've used the problem as an opportunity to show their customers that they do value us and score some points.  Unfortunately for them and for us customers, the cold response I've gotten from them tells me that they really could care less and do not have a long term outlook on what it means to sell a business product as important as a scheduling device.  It's best to stay away from them.  I'm through giving PALM any more business.  If you find a better company, please do share.";Palm Quality Control & Customer Service is below Sub Par

I was very impressed with the added functions, the slick design and the long lasting rechargeable battery. I wrote a glowing review of the product (4 stars) on Amazon. The only complaint I had was the 90 days warranty period.  I thought it was too short. Four months later, I encountered a problem trying to power up the palm. It just won't power up. I tried various ""reset"" modes and none worked. I finally contacted Palm support and they informed me that the warranty period had expired and that it would cost me $149 to repair it.  The original cost of the Palm Tungsten E2 was only $199. Obviously I declined. I started searching on the web and I found out there are many others with the same problem.  It turns out to be a defect of this particular device. I am positive Palm knew about this and yet they choose to deny any problem and cover it up. What a sad position for a Corporation to take. At first, I thought the problem was a defective battery, it turned out not to be. I later discovered that the device had a cold solder joint. I found a guy on eBay that repairs Palm devices and it only cost me $46 + shipping. A bargain compared what Palm had to offer.\n\nI am writing this follow up review to warn other customers of Palm's poor product support. They are not playing fair. They will make you pay for their mistakes. This new culture is very disturbing. They have made the financial calculation that it is cheaper to ignore and deny a problem than to offer a recall and an apology. This is clearly a defect of one of their products which they knew from the start. Why else would they only offer a short warranty period? As opposed to 1 year on the other Palm model T2. I will not buy another product from Palm and I would not recommend this to others. Buyers beware!!! It is a shame that an otherwise excellent product should suffer because of bad judgments on the part of their Corp. Executives. I have written a formal complaint to the head office and have not received any reply. I guess it was too much to expect.\n\n-Jack Lee\n\nYorktown Hts.

3;1.0;1.0;5.0;I don't mind if you are going to sell a generic brand cable, but tell me. I ordered this cable from Margin Mart because it said Belkin. At least the ad did, the cable receive was clearly not a Belkin cable. I do not care if it works or not...BUT IT DOESN'T...you should not lie like that in an advertisement.;Not Belkin
5;2.0;1.0;14.0;"The cable I received is not a Belkin cable.  It is a cheap no name cable. The picture is of a gray cable with the Belkin name molded in the plastic ends.  I received a cheap thin plain black cable in a clear plastic bag with the made in china sticker. It was sold by ""marginmart inc"" and fulfilled by amazon.  I feel I was lied to and ripped off.";NOT  BELKIN !!
4;3.0;1.0;6.0;Title says it all. These are very low quality cables and the female end is a joke. Look for ones that actually cover the male end you plug in and not this cheesy aluminum end like this one has.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MT1EQM/ref=oh_o04_s00_i00_details\n\nthis is the cable I went to and it rocked. Worked perfect for reasonable price.  You'll be glad you read this post.  God Bless;Junk cheap and 'dollar store value'  be warned/don't bother
1;4.0;5.0;86.0;Many don't know that their USB devices can actually reside some distance away from their computers, because they've become used to the limitations placed upon them by the cords that come with their peripherals.  But this cable makes it possible to achieve a balance between functionality and aesthetics.  With this Belkin component, you can now think of setting up an entire room as an information hub, rather than just huddling your computer station into a cramped corner.  For those who have multiple platforms in one area, this extension cord will make it possible to more easily share USB devices without having to buy an additional USB switcher.  Just plug and unplug your devices at will with the additional length.\nIf there's anything negative to say about the product, it's that you don't have much choice as to manufacturer.  In a real sense, that doesn't matter:  you're going to be happy with what Belkin has on offer.  But it would be at least psychologically comforting to have more of a choice.;Get the clutter off your desk
6;5.0;1.0;5.0;"Just ordered three of these cables.  Their appearance is slightly different than the Belkin product, and there is no labeling or package.  Tried all 3 on two different PCs.  They get a ""USB device is not recognized"" message.  I have to assume these are knock-off products.  Beware!";Not really Belkin
0;6.0;5.0;60.0;This USB extension is just what I was hoping it would be. I bought a USB scanner recently, and I wanted it placed on top of a shelf away from my computer. This cord solved the distance problem with ease. I have noticed no change in the scanners performance since adding this extension cable.;Just As Promised
14;7.0;5.0;49.0;If you're looking for a basic 10' USB extension cable, you've come to the right place.  Belkin's products have always been reliable, and this one is no different.\n\nThe Belkin F3U134-10 is a 20-gauge 10' USB cable, A plug to A receptacle.  I use mine on an older PC that only has USB ports on the back of its tower. Thanks to this cable, I no longer need to climb under furniture to insert my USB memory key.\n\nIf you plan to use this cable to extend a shorter cable, be aware of recommended USB cable length limits.  Low-density devices (e.g. mice and keyboards) should not exceed cable lengths of 10', while high-density USB devices such as scanners and printers should be limited to a total cable length of 16 feet. If you plan to extend your current USB cable beyond these limits, consider getting a repeating cable such as the Belkin Active Extension USB Cable.\n\nPerhaps the best reason to buy this USB cable from Amazon is to get their hefty discount on Belkin products. You'll pay about a third what you would at your local electronics store.  Now that's a bargain!;Amazon and Belkin team up for another great deal
13;8.0;5.0;35.0;"Ok, let's clear up some confusion about this cable.\n\nAccording to the Belkin site this cable actually works up to speeds of 480Mb/s, which means it's a High Speed USB compatible cable. You can search Belkin's website for part# F3U134-10 for the page.  (For a brief discussion on USB standards see the next paragraph.)  It's unfortunate that Amazon has an obsolete/inaccurate description, but for the price it's tough to beat.\n\nOk now for the promised discussion on USB standards.  The USB 1.1 specification was incorporated into the USB 2.0 specification which has created a lot of confusion.  USB 1.1 had a maximum transfer rate of 12Mb/s and USB 2.0 has a maximum of 480Mb/s.  However USB 2.0 can run at the lower, 12Mb/s rate and still be called USB 2.0 (thus the confusion).  Only if a device says ""High Speed USB"" can you be sure that it's capable of running at 480Mb/s.";Product description inaccurate -and that's good.
17;9.0;5.0;39.0;With this kind of product, it just come down to if it works or it doesn't.  Unlike speaker or video cables, the quality of shielding or core material does not really make the differences.\nThere are standard for USB 1.1, and USB 2.0.  If the cable was manufactured to meet those standard, it works.  If it didn't... Well, it won't work.\nThis product works well with all my needs.  But if you are looking for cables for USB 2.0 products, look else where. USB 2.0 requires much higher quality cable.;It works well
19;10.0;5.0;24.0;"It's ironic that this came with a warning about the length of USB cables which basically meant to say ""Don't use this product"" It should be atleast a foot shorter to avoid exceeding the 10 foot maximum described in their warning tag, since all usb devices come with atleast a foot of cable built in (that this extension plugs into) but no matter, I've used it for over a month on a USB webcam with a 6 foot cable built into it which I plugged into this cord and haven't had any problems yet.";too long
15;11.0;5.0;20.0;"I recently purchased an inexpensive webcam, which came with a 8-inches long USB cord. Obviously whoever manufactured it intended the cord to reach from the PC monitor/LCD to the back of the computer, and nothing more. This was unacceptable.<P>\n\nLuckily I browsed around and found this cable, which was a lifesaver. It's got a female ""A"" plug on one side and a male ""A"" plug on the other, effectively working as an ""extension cord"" (to be plugged in the middle, between your pc and one of your existing USB cables that is attached to your USB device).\n\nVery good quality cables. Inexpensive price. To paraphrase Jerry Pournelle on the legendary Byte magazine: ""Recommended!"". :)";Great, quality cable
7;12.0;3.0;7.0;This works for the practical things such as printers and keyboards. However, if you need to connect something that is data heavy and requires the use of USB 2.0, such as an external hard drive or a HD camera, you need to look elsewhere.\n\nThat being said, the high price disappoints me for such old technology. Although, it overall depends on what you need it for.;Beware that it's USB 1.1
10;13.0;1.0;10.0;I purchased this as an extension form my iMac's keyboard, since the attached cable is way too short. I hooked it up and nothing... Neither the keyboard or the mouse would function. I know it's only USB 1.1 speeds, but that shouldn't be a problem for a keyboard/mouse combo. So if you're looking to pick one of these up, make sure it's compatible with the hardware you are using.;Doesn't work with my iMac
11;14.0;1.0;9.0;Bought 4 of these to get the free shipping. Could not get them to work with web cameras. Tried two different cameras and two different cables with no success. Do not buy these if you intend to hook up a camera to them. I haven't tried any other usb device yet. Good luck.;Didn't work for me
12;15.0;4.0;11.0;I've purchased several Belkin cables and they always seem to be well made.  Only problem with this particular cable is that it is not USB 2.0 which I didn't realize when I bought it.  I had intended to attach it to another cable which I purchased at the same time.  According to the instructions, it is not advisable.\n\nThe mistake was completely mine.  I just didn't think to check for USB 2.0 when I purchased it.;High quality cable but not USB 2.0
16;16.0;5.0;13.0;...That such an excellent piece of equipment could be 'reviewed' by persons that are computer challenged. These JOKERS should seek help before buying a product and writing negative reviews because THEY bought the wrong product! GEEZ!\nThis USB extension cable has performed beyond my expectations for over 8 months. There has been NO noticeable [at least not to me] degradation in performance to my accessories [digital camera, webcam and JUMPDRIVE ] by using this extension cord and it means that I do not have to be fiddling behind or leaning down in front of the computer to attach and detach the equipment.\nIt is a GREAT buy!;It's AMAZING....
18;17.0;1.0;12.0;This might have been a great cable if only it fit into the slot on the Canon i320 bubblejet printer I bought from Amazon.com.  My objection is: why did Amazon.com recommend this cable when I purchased my printer?  It's so misleading and totally betrayed my trust in Amazon.com.  I waited the whole week till I have time on the weekend to unpack my packages and print some photos--now I'll have to go cable shopping instead!;Bad Recommendation from Amazon.com
8;18.0;1.0;6.0;My Flip Video Ultra Series Camcorder wouldn't connect using this cable.  I purchased a Flip Video Ultra Series Camcorder along with this Belkin F3U134-10 USB Extension Cable.  My computer (Dell running XP Pro) wouldn't recognize the USB device (Flip Ultra) using this cable.  The Flip connected immediately when plugged directly into the USB port.\nBelkin is a reputable supplier but this cable got just 1 star for my application.;Flip Video Ultra Series Camcorder wouldn't connect...
9;19.0;1.0;6.0;I bought this cable as it was listed on the same page and as a common adjunct to the Canon laser printer I bought.  Please be advised that there are two styles of USB ends.  A & B.  To hook up a printer you need an A to B cable.  This cord is A to A and will not work.  Wasted my money and then had to buy a cable locally.  Description should have pointed this out.;Be Advised
20;20.0;1.0;8.0;I was ordering a cable to connect my laptop to the desk top and thought this cable would do the job from the discription.  When I received the cable it was just a extention cable to add between unit and computer.  Well I E mailed the supplier and he indicated would not take the cable back but would supply the correct cable for much more than I had paid.  Well I have a cable I can't use and bought the correct cable else ware.;Discription misunderstood
2;21.0;5.0;7.0;"I am totally satisfied with this product, even a little elated. It turned out to be more then I expected, the length was unexpectedly long...I hadn't noticed the measurement in the description. But I figured with the price, I'd take the chance. I definitely recommend this, as they  say, ""as a best buy"".";Best value for your buck
21;22.0;5.0;6.0;This extension cord frees up space without any sacrifice in quality. I am ordering another one.;10ft Extension Cable

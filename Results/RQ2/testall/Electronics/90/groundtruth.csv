84;1.0;5.0;686.0;Half the price of my Tivoli Songbook, the PR-D5 has superior AM/FM reception, dual stereo speakers, and easy-to-use ergonomics, making it even better than the Sangean single-speaker Sonido. As a bedside radio, it has even better FM reception than my Sangean WR-2 but it lacks the WR-2's depth and heaviness, qualities I like in a bedside radio. For a lighter, portable radio with no remote, go for the PR-D5. If you want more luxury in your radio (remote, numerical volume indicator, heavier feel) and don't mind a slight compromise in FM reception, you might want to check out the Sangean WR-2, which is compatible with an upgraded FM antenna attachment.\n\nOne question many will have is why the PR-D5 goes for about 15 dollars less than the Sonido. The answer most likely is that the 2.5-inch stereo speakers on the PR-D5 don't have the richness nor the depth of the Sonido's 3-inch monoaural speaker.\n\nUpdate: Ironically, I don't like listening to talk radio on dual speakers. This is not a technological issue, but psychological. The voices don't seem as focused as they do on the Sangean WR-2's monoaural speaker. So if you're a heavy AM talk radio listener, you might want to opt for the WR-2.\n\nSecond Update: To really test the FM on the PR-D5, I tried to pull in the weak college station 88.9. The PR-D5 pulled in the station with clarity, even better than my Eton S350. The verdict: My PR-D5 is my best performing AM/FM radio, even better than the Eton/Grundig S350. That says quite a lot. Even more astounding, the PR-D5 is 15 dollars cheaper.\n\nThird Update: I brought my PR-D5 to my work office and like all the digital radios I've tried it suffered compromised reception. I succeeded more with my Tivoli Model Three (same as the Model One with the additional clock). So for your office, if it's full of computer interference, you might want to go with an upscale analog radio like the aforementioned Tivoli Model One or Three.\n\nFourth Update:\n\nPower supply stopped working and Sangean replaced my entire radio two or three years ago. Since that time, my speakers have gradually suffered distortion to the point that I no longer use my PR-D5. Mind you, this distortion took place with normal use.\n\nThese speakers were a bit muffled to begin with, as most people agree is a problem with the PR-D5. But distortion made this unusable.\n\nI now recommend a more superior Sangean, the CL-100: Better FM, better crisp speaker sound. And it's cheaper than the PR-D5.;Stellar AM/FM Reception at Attractive Price Point
38;2.0;4.0;270.0;I bought this radio because\n1. This is from Sangean\n2. Digital Tuning with frequency display\n3. Stereo Speakers\n4. RDS Info Display\n5. Can be used as a mobile phone/laptop speakers\n6. Looks sophisticated and modern\n7. Alarm\n8. Black version available against the white one\n\nThe overall built quality is excellent and has a metal body. You can feel\nthe richness. It has an ergonomic tuning and volume knob both has a soft\nrubber feel. Nice to hold. The tuning jogs up/down .1MHz steps and can feel\nthe click. Interesting feature is the frequency scan. You can push the\ntuning knob and it lands to the next audible station! This makes the frequency\nexactly to the .1MHz frequency. Then you can easily long press the memory button\nand store the station into the memory! Cool.\n\nOne of the greatest features of this radio I liked is its Aux connection. ie. you can\nconnect your mobile phone/mp3 player and Laptop using a 3.5mm male to male connector\n(need to buy separately). I bought an 8ft cord.\nI ordered it when I ordered the radio.\n\nIt plays the MP3 songs from my mobile phone nicely. Another interesting thing I do is\nI put Internet radio on my Android phone and play it through the Aux speakers.\nThis opens a huge world of Internet radio!\n\nThe biggest drawback I would like to notify the Sangean company is that the Bass tone\nis hardwired into the circuitry. There is no Bass/Tone knob. At least the Sangean\ncompany can hard wire a bass+treble audio so that it's neither bassy nor trebly :)\n\nMy Suggestions for Improvement to Sangean. (Hope they read these feedbacks)\n1. Add a Bass/Tone knob.\n2. Toggle switch to keep the display lights always on.\n3. RDS to display below the frequency which is done nicely on Android phone FM\nradio application. ie. RDS/frequency and time need to be displayed together.\nRight now RDS info comes after seconds you tune the station.\n4. Battery Re-charge feature.\n5. Five more buttons to store the memory. ie. at least 10 FM stations are okay.\nFive is very less these days.\n6. The frequency scan by pushing the tuning knob is very hard. Make it soft.\n\nTo Summarize, this is a very good radio with just one drawback.\nThe audio is bassy. If you like bass audio, then its okay. It is good\nfor speech. It makes the speech soft. For music, it requires treble response, so that\nthe instruments will be more clear. The stereo capability is not\neasily noticeable on speakers.\n\nCompared to other FM radios in this price range, this is the best available in the\nmarket today.\n\nI think the black version is new. Black is beautiful and looks sophisticated. My laptop\nand mobile phone are all black. White looks odd, and everyone notice it.\nBlack is cool and you can take it anywhere.\n\nI give only 4 stars because of the bassy audio quality and make Sangean to\nadd a bass/treble knob. Once this is done, I am sure, this radio will be\nthe best in the world in this price range.\n\nHope you find this review useful.\n\nUpdate:\nThe memory is not stored permanently. When the unit is switched off today and then switched on tomorrow, all the memories goes EMPTY.\nThis is very disappointing. Not sure, whether this is a defect. If you know about this, do let me know.;Good FM-AM-AUX Stereo Radio
1;3.0;4.0;5.0;I like it because it has an alarm clock, is portable, has good FM reception, and is a great improvement over my last radio.  Two shortcomings it has are poor AM reception, and to tell the current time I have to press a button. $60 is what I paid for mine.;Alarm clock, Good FM reception, Is Portable, Upgrade from Previous Radio
83;4.0;4.0;285.0;The PR-D5 upgrades Sangean's well-reviewed Sonido radio with a second speaker, the 200mm internal AM antenna from their CCRadio, a well designed side-mounted tuning knob, and a few other touches.\n\nThe iPod-generation look of the new radio doesn't appeal to me, but that's a matter of taste, so you can judge that one for yourself. The pushbuttons unfortunately seem to be the same pressure-sensitive foil type used on the Sonido and CCradio, which tend to stand up poorly to prolonged use, but at least the addition of the new tuning knob means you'll use the pushbuttons less, so perhaps that's not a major issue.\n\nI find the dual speakers odd, but the audio is loud and clear, especially in FM stereo mode. Mono FM mode really cleans up the weaker signals. I have not found the dual speakers to be a problem on AM voice, as Jeff McMahon writes. The AUX input is a nice feature given how many MP3 players and other such gadgets people use now. The backlight goes on for a few seconds if you touch any non-analog control - very practical. There's no real handle, just a slender ridge along the top back of the radio for your fingertips to precariously claw at, so don't try picking this thing up with wet hands.\n\nWhat really distinguishes this unit, however, is it's performance as a receiver. This degree of FM sensitivity and selectivity would be outstanding on any portable, but at this price I suspect it may be a first. Really strong AM receivers are rarer still, despite all the hype that gets thrown around, but the PR-D5 is up there with the best of them. When I ordered it I hoped that it might at best match my aging CCRadio on AM reception, and have indeed found them too close to call - with the newer radio at half the price of the older.\n\nI am giving the PR-D5 fours stars because I find the design quirky, and am concerned mostly with AM voice programming. If you are primarily interested in FM stereo, this design makes more sense. On a strictly value-for-dollar basis, it's a strong five stars either way.\n\nHope that helps you decide.;Quirky Design, Outstanding Reception, Breakthough Price
76;5.0;1.0;190.0;I purchased this radio on Amazon and received it today. I am sorely disappointed. Many of the reviews I read online noted the radio's great AM/FM reception quality, which is the main reason I sprung for this model. However, to my surprise, even in the broadcast-rich region I live in, I received only 5 FM stations clearly. For fun I even checked a map to see where they came from, and they're all within 10-15 miles of my home. I cannot receive the NPR news station that has a transmitter 6 miles away. By comparison, I receive about 20 FM stations very very clearly on my car radio even when it's parked right outside my house where I've been trying the Sangean. To add insult to injury, the little radio that came inside of my Microsoft Zune MP3 player gets the same stations as the Sangean clearly, and without any antenna! Perhaps mine is faulty, but either way it's getting returned.;A different story....
3;6.0;4.0;8.0;"I bought this in November 2017 to (finally) replace my GE Superadio III that I've had for over 10 years... telescoping antenna accidentally broke.  I live almost 50 miles from NYC, so to get NYC radio stations requires a very strong radio, and the GE worked great.  Its drawback was the analog dial, which was inaccurate to say the least.\n\nI compared various models from C.Crane and Sangean, and decided on the Sangean PR-D5.  I don't need shortwave or weather bands, and I wanted a digital tuner, but I don't need anything else.  This radio sits by my home office desk, and I listen to it while working.  Worked great for 4 weeks, then stopped cold in the middle of the day.  Granted, I hadn't paid much attention to the screen, so I probably missed the low-battery indicator.  Was just a ""PWR"" on the screen and no  buttons worked.  The only way to reset this thing is to take the old batteries out, wait 3-5 full minutes until the PWR is gone from the screen, then put new batteries in.  In contrast, the Superadio III would begin to fade when batteries were about to die, but it would respond instantly when new batteries were installed.  During the 5 minutes without battery or AC, the Sangean does maintain your radio station settings, but apparently not the clock - not important to me, since I have clocks around me, but could be an issue for someone else.\n\nThe radio performs well, no station drift, and picks up AM and FM stations as well as the GE.  But the battery swap procedure taking 3-5 minutes for no good reason cost this radio one star in my rating.";Good radio, but strange battery-swap procedure
2;7.0;3.0;5.0;"I moved into a new home and could not pull in decent AM/FM radio  not even with a Yagi antenna that worked well in a former residence. Despite the fact that most of my radios and receivers have digital PLL tuners, stations from various geographical areas fight with each other for the same frequency  not only on AM but FM radio and not only at night but even in the middle of the day! Reception was so bad that most of my radios  even when run on battery power to eliminate the electrical as a source of interference  could not pull in more than one or two nearby AM/FM stations. (On the flip side, sometimes the radios I had on hand received stations hundreds of miles North or South of me on AM but not the ones located in my own area  hence my use of the ""Bermuda Triangle"" of AM/FM radio in my review title.)\n\nI listen to a well-known nightly talk show that broadcasts on a 50,000-watt AM station that can be heard outside of the state where I live  but in my current home it was entirely usurped on all but two of my radios (an ancient iHome iPod/Clock radio and a BOSE Wave radio, with only the BOSE holding the station with any reliability). Buying another radio was a must if I was to listen ""live"" to my daily program. (Don't ask me why, but I much prefer live radio over podcasts, iHeart radio and the like.)\n\nAfter searching the web, I came across a blogger who does nothing but review all manner of AM/FM radio. He said that the Sangean PR-D5 was a bargain that had flown under the wire for many radio enthusiasts. He rated it 4.5 stars so I jumped on Amazon and ordered the PR-D5.\n\nThis purchase is only my second for the Sangean brand. The first was a shower radio with a mono speaker reviewed elsewhere on Amazon. My Sangean shower radio developed finicky buttons after a couple of years of use such that attempting to change volume will, instead, change the station. This, too, was among the radios in my new home that can't grab and hold AM/FM stations reliably (meaning next to nill). However, after reading the review of this model  and appreciating that the AM antenna is 200mm, which is about as generous as they come  I took the plunge.\n\nIMPRESSION\n\n4.5 stars: Does what I need and pulls in  and more importantly holds  the desired AM/FM frequency. This, alone, makes it well worth the cost for those of us who live in areas where reception is particularly challenging. (That's not to say I now have a perfect AM listening experience, however. I still experience AM drift at night, however it doesn't lose my station entirely to fade-out, which is a significant achievement considering how many radios could not even tune the frequency to begin with.)\n\n1 star: Audio sounds as if it is muffled by a thin pillow, especially on AM. Whether on AM or FM, the sound quality is not much improved over my mono-speaker Sangean shower radio. This is disappointing because I was really excited to order a stereo radio given the fact that so many radios I own are unusable in my location. Moreover, it's also becoming harder to find anything in this size or smaller in a stereo (two-speaker) design. One of the great mysteries of the universe is why manufacturers are selling Internet and HD radios, even, paired to a monaural speaker. Is this 1954? (But I digress.)\n\n3 stars: The controls are not as intuitive as I expected considering how straightforward the layout per the product images. I am accustomed to picking things up and being able to program and set the time on the spot. With this radio I had to consult the user guide to set the clock and even to operate functions that I had in fact attempted to do correctly. As an example, I tried to set the station presets as I do on my other Sangean  by holding in the button for a couple of seconds to save the station  but instead the radio responded as if I had selected an existing (factory?) preset. I then consulted the user manual thinking I had been wrong about how to go about setting presets. Turns out, I had to apply more force to the button to trigger the preset memory. Another thing I don't care for is that the sleep button shares its function with the on/off button. As a result, I had a similar experience in attempt to set the sleep timer. I held the button in to trigger the sleep function but all I kept getting was ""60 minutes"" (the default). Again I had to consult the user manual to confirm that there were other increments to choose from, and how to cycle through them. Because some button functions are shared and/or are very specific about the level of pressure they require to operate  and because my Sangean shower radio apparently wasn't the exception for having buttons malfunction per other Amazon reviews  I fear the longevity of the use of the sleep button, which is a must-have feature for my needs, may be limited. On the plus side, I do like the ease with which it is possible to change volume and frequency, as compared to my Sangean shower radio. The rotary knobs make it quick to change the station or the volume  an improvement, I think, over having to repeatedly hit an Up or Down button (as is the case with the shower radio).\n\n4 stars: I like that this radio comes with the AC adapter. A trend I noticed while shopping for a radio is that manufacturers are increasingly leaving the adapters out as a secondary (separate) purchase. Not so with this radio. Although I intend to operate the PR-D5 mostly on the C-batteries, it's nice to know that I can plug it in to an electrical outlet. That said, there is a note included with the product stating that because of FCC energy efficiency requirements for AC adapters that the adapter may cause interference to the AM band.\n\n3 stars: The form factor of this radio is attractive (I bought the silver/white version). That said, there is no carrying handle and when the C-batteries are inserted it becomes a bit difficult to use because the unit becomes somewhat heavy. The surface is slick so my concern is that it will eventually be dropped.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI rate the PR-D5 three stars, overall, is because the audio quality is a let-down. On the AM band, at night, the sound becomes a bit muddier  meaning even less treble  which doesn't help. FM stereo is better but not particularly enjoyable. (In fairness, however, I am spoiled by a Harman/Kardon audio receiver paired to Klipsch speakers, a Bose Wave radio and the Sony XDR-F1HD  the latter of which has somewhat of a cult following  so I may be pickier than most although I'm far from a true audiophile.)\n\nThe drawback to this model, much like the Sangean shower radio I own, is that the factory-set EQ is not optimized for talk radio in the least. I find this especially odd when you consider that the top selling point of the PR-D5 is the exceptional AM sensitivity. Because I purchased this radio mostly for AM reception, it's disappointing to have to turn the volume up louder than I might otherwise if the audio were optimized for talk. (In particular, this is not ideal for nighttime listening when you might prefer more treble to improve talk radio audio in lieu of a volume boost.) As a workaround, I hooked my PR-D5 to external speakers only to find the sound was largely unimproved. (If I had to guess, the circuitry's main emphasis is to minimizing the intrusiveness of interference, where present, so that hiss/static are not accentuated the way it is on radios with full-range sound  hence the audio-quality trade-offs.)\n\nIf I had to do it all over again  and since I'm still within the return period I just might  I'd pay more and spring for the Sangean PR-D15, also sold here on Amazon, which adds bass & treble controls, the option to run off of rechargeable batteries and, notably, a carrying handle. In short, I'm still on the fence as to whether or not this particular model is a keeper.";"Does the job in the ""Bermuda Triangle"" of AM/FM Radio"
10;8.0;2.0;38.0;I needed a radio for my office. Selecting features and reading reviews, this radio was my choice. I have used this radio up to 2 hours a day Monday through Friday since January 4, 2016. I attempted to turn my radio on yesterday after my morning meeting, nothing happened. Checked the power supply, it was intact. I tried using it on battery power, nothing happened. Changed the batteries, again, nothing would work, not even the display. Last night I checked the return policy on this unit and found my window of opportunity to return it closed January 31, 2016. It lasted seven weeks. For the money paid, I truly expected more longevity and durability. I will no longer consider this brand for future purchases until I am convinced the manufacturer produces a reliable product.;Very short life for money paid.
0;9.0;4.0;85.0;"As it is with many products these days, a bit more time taken in design and  more attention to detail in the execution would have made this a 5-star product. First, just how portable is a unit this large (and heavy, with the 6 C batteries installed) without a shoulder strap? They do give you a grip rail on the back so you won't drop it carrying it from room to room, but it's not satisfactory for say, a camping or hiking trip. And speaking of batteries, Sangean did not put a foam pad on the inside of the battery hatch lid to help prevent the batteries from shifting around. That lack is not hard to rectify, but it did detract from my score for this unit. This just in: I wondered if there was any protection for the memory, etc. when it is time to change the batteries, so today (8/26/07) I ran some tests to find out. I pulled a battery for various periods up to one minute - the presets and other memories remained intact and the clock held too. A REAL MANUAL would tell you exactly how much time you have to putz around and get the new batteries in. It would also tell you that you MUST install batteries for the memories to be maintained for lengthy periods.\n.  As with the RCR-22 which I also reviewed today, the ""manual"" leaves much to be desired. For the units shipped to North America, Sangean could leave out all the languages except for English, Spanish and French, and use the freed-up pages for more thorough information. Simple things for the non-technical folks like whether you plug the AC adapter into the radio and then into the AC outlet or vice-versa would be useful (the first method is correct for nearly all AC adapters). And for the more technically literate buyer, what happens when you plug in the AC adapter? Does it disconnect the batteries entirely or just protect them with a diode? Apparently the batteries are protected by a diode as nothing happens (the radio keeps on playing and the clock tells the time) when you plug the AC adapter into the radio while the adapter is not plugged into an AC outlet. At least make complete info available from the web site, but noooo... My first Sangean, the ATS-803, AM/FM/Shortwave receiver came with a REAL MANUAL, but then it cost more than twice as much too. Unfortunately some sleazy barstid [sic] stole it from me.\n.  The controls are very easy to use and the reception is excellent (as noted by Universal Radio on their web site). As with many other Sangean models, the AM tuner and antenna system is not simply an afterthought. The speakers give a very good sound for their size and there is a headphone jack for those who want even better sound quality. I tried a pair of self-powered speakers (such as used with computers, etc.) with it to great effect. As Letterman is fond of saying: You can ""blow the roof off the joint!""\n.  I listen to AM radio a lot, so I've looked more closely at that aspect of the PR-D5. This past evening I listened to WSB in Atlanta very clearly (I'm in a deep valley in the Finger Lakes of NY). I recall picking up Charlotte, N.C. and New Orleans too. The length of this unit (10-3/4"") means you will need a good sized, free area on your night stand or table to rotate it for best reception and perhaps a way to elevate it too. Though a couple of my nearby AM stations are working on their transmitters/towers, I am still able to receive them at their current low power outputs.\n.  The other functions of clock, alarm, timers, etc. work as described, and since this unit lacks a direct-entry number pad, the presets are a necessity. I set them to my regulars and fortunately their frequencies are scattered pretty well across the band (from 570 to 1390) so they can serve as starting points for tuning other frequencies. I'd prefer that the available 10 presets could be used for either AM or FM band stations, but the five I have for AM are just adequate for my  needs.\n.  A thorough manual would have gotten the PR-D5 a 9 point or 4.5 star rating from me. One can't ask for more pure radio performance from a unit in this price range. I don't think that anyone would be really disappointed with this radio. .bh.";The PR-D5, an excellent portable radio.
12;10.0;5.0;35.0;I'm not an engineer, but I am an avid radio listener, which is becoming an endangered species.  I wanted a good looking small radio for our remodeled bathroom so I can listen to music and NPR while I get ready.  The look of this is very modern and has nice clean lines, but it had to have good sound, eliminating all the cheap small radios as an option.  I have two Bose radios in other places in my house, so that's what I would compare this to.  The sound is AMAZING out of those two little speakers.  Almost better than my Bose radio!!!  Also, the reception is way better than the Bose, which doesn't have a dedicated antenna.  You can see in the picture that I have the antenna extended a bit.  I put the antenna down and tucked it away, which improved the look and didn't degrade the reception.\n\nThe preset buttons are very easy to program and I love the volume knob on the side, which is easy to turn.\n\nIf this radio had a rechargeable built-in battery like my bluetooth speakers, that would make it completely perfect.  Otherwise, it's *almost* completely perfect.\n\nNote:  The picture looks black and white, but it's not.  Our bathroom is white and grey!;Good looking great radio
30;11.0;1.0;44.0;Beware!  This manufacturer has major quality control problems!  The first radio I received was totally dead right out of the box.  I received a replacement in two days and the second radio worked fine on the AC power supply but the display flashed PWR FAIL when I tried to play it on batteries.  I tried two sets of batteries and checked them all with a voltmeter.  Nothing!  I decided against a third radio and requested a refund from Amazon.com.  I have had a Sangean (CCRadio) portable radio on my nightstand for over 15 years and it has proven to be a quality product.  AMAZON deserves a five star rating for their handling of this transaction, but it is likely that Sangean is not long for this world if they continue to produce defective radios like the two PR-D5 models that I received.;Warning

4;13.0;1.0;10.0;For all the product's blurb and that of other reviewers, the quality of sound on this so-called stereo radio leaves much to be desired. Yes, it looks nice and yes, it was quite easy to program stations. But its sound is muffled. I own a less expensive Sangean radio, the kind that's good for emergencies like no power, where you can crank it to juice it up. Its sound is clear and crisp, perfect to listen to. Every time I even look at the newer one I bought, I get angry all over again. Alas, I waited too long to do anything about it. My advice? Just don't buy it. It's awful. Surely there's a better product for you out there.;Don't buy this model!!

59;15.0;5.0;44.0;"It's been two months since this little radio arrived at my doorstep from Amazon.  Here are my opinions about this radio:\n\nRECEPTON\nI purchased this radio with hope for above-average FM reception, and I was NOT disappointed :)  This radio is capable of receiving low power FM stations without much effort.  No more antenna acrobatics for me.  I can receive a local non-profit FM swing jazz station clearly and without too much special antenna positioning.  Just extend the antenna, turn on the radio, and....that's it :)  This low power FM station radiates only 100 Watts and most of my radios have problems receiving it clearly, but this Sangean unit pulls it in as if it were a large commercial FM station.  No hiss at all in Stereo mode.  RDS is an added bonus :)\nAM reception is also outstanding.  Being in San Francisco Bay Area I can listen to news from LA on KNX and traffic reports from Vegas.  Going through the AM band at night with this radio is so much fun. I am impressed with sensitivity and selectivity of the AM tuner in this little radio.  Outstanding.\nSOUND\nMany (most?) portable radios on the market today sound like cheap answering machines.  No clear trebles, no trace of bass, just a blast of mid-range, which may cause listener fatigue after a while.  Designers sacrifice sound quality for better battery life.  Fortunately, Sangean engineers decided to use long throw speakers for better low frequency response.  These speakers consume more current and eat more batteries, but they also sound much better.  For a portable radio of this size, this Sangean sounds very good.  It sounds ""larger"" than it is.  On FM, treble and bass are well balanced, and there is NO emphasis on the mid-range found in most small portables these days.  Sound quality on AM band is also good.  I wish it were a little warmer on AM but it's fine.  With 0.8 Watts per channel this radio can fill the room with talk or music, and it can do it without strain.  Music on FM sounds surprisingly good on this small radio.\nQUALITY\nTwo thumbs up.  This radio is built well and solid.  With batteries installed it is relatively heavy for such small unit, but in this case heavy is good.  If you don't want to use batteries you can use the enclosed AC adapter.  Controls and buttons provide good feedback, and FM antenna hides away without effort.\nI am an avid radio enthusiast and I can tell you that it is a pleasure to hold this Sangean radio in your hands and to use it.  In my opnion it's an all around fine AM(DX)/FM portable receiver.\n\nI have not used the alarm clock or battery recharge features of the radio so I cannot comment on them, but based just on reception performance and sound quality I would recommend this radio to anyone :)\n\nEdit March 27, 2015:\nIt was brought to my attention that this model can't charge batteries.  My bad.  Please ignore the part about battery charging.\n\nAs of March 27, 2015 my radio is still going strong.  I use it every day for at least 4 hours, and sometimes I fall asleep while listening in late evenings, so it's on until morning.  Superb quality and longevity.";Simply a Very Good Portable Radio
81;16.0;5.0;47.0;I fully agree with nearly all the comments offered on this radio, having received one as an (expected) gift at Christmas.  First a couple of neutral or negative comments.  The radio is just like the picture shows it - not everyone's idea of a 'portable radio' a la the (worn out but more conventionally packaged) Grundig Yachtboy 400 that this radio replaced.  But as indicated below I think the positives way outweigh any negatives and in person I find it a very nice package.  Also the user's manual leaves something to be desired.  Without going into details about all such minutia, the way that the clock can be set while the radio is on requires you enter the clock set mode first (not explained in manual) and the capturing of the correct time from the RDS signal took some experimenting to get to work correctly (can't absolutely state this with assurance but some RDS signals don't seem to have the clock setting signal and I have one station that seems to set the internal radio clock inaccurately - but I have located one local RDS station that reliably can set the clock).  Now for the positives.  The sound is excellent for a radio this size.  The speakers, though small, seem to be of excellent quality and can, if required, fill a large room with pleasant sound.  At close range (say 2 feet away) the stereo effect on FM is very natural and pleasant.  On the AM side, I find the selectivity and particularly sensitivity to be the best of any small radio I've ever seen.  Last night (from Falls Church, VA) I received KOA in Denver, the first time in a long time that I have been able to pull it from the loads of co-channel interference.  All the original clear channels (WSM,WMAQ,WLW,WOR,WGN,Canada,WJR,WABC,WBBM,WGY,WCCO,WHAS,and on up the dial) were received in excellent fashion, some of the nearer ones sounding like locals.  I will use this radio mostly while travelling and am looking to a long and pleasant assoication.;Excellent Radio and Value

26;19.0;1.0;31.0;"This started out to be such a good radio.  Here's how we used it.  In our house, we have a FM transmitter and we play Pandora through it.  So any room in the house that can tune into 90.1 FM can pick up what's playing on Pandora.  Problem is, there are so few decent radios out there and the speakers usually are poor.\n\nThen we got the Sangean PR-D5 radio.  It looks nice, has decent sound and easy tuning.\n\nAs I said, we only tune it to the one frequency that picks up our transmitter.\n\nOK...so it works well for almost 15 months and then, as so many people reported, it began to search for stations all on its own.  It was maddening.  You tune it (or for us, it was just leave it on the one signal) and it begins this searching business.  Also the lighted front started turning on and off as well.\n\nBut it gets better.  I emailed Sangean America and sent them details of the problem.  A representative by the name of Bob, leaves a message on my v-mail saying to please call ""so we can talk about the problem"".  I'm thinking ""great!"" because $70 bucks is a lot to pay for a radio that lasted a little more than a year.\n\nSo now I'm on the phone with Bob and he asks me if I've been using the radio in the bathroom or in a humid area.  I told him that the radio is in an air-conditioned and heated location in the house...we're in Northern New Jersey...and no, the humidity level isn't high.\n\nI asked him how long he thought the radio should last, he replied that he wouldn't venture to say.  I asked what he could do, he offered a repair for $45 (and I assume shipping), but that doesn't make sense for a $70 radio.\n\nAfter I hung up with him (and I was pleasant enough), I wondered....why did he want me to call and talk to him about the radio?  He offered nothing...so is Sangean full of lonely people who want some of my quality time???\n\nWeird.  Too much money for a short lived radio.";Doesn't work after 15 months of light use
21;20.0;1.0;26.0;My office is within 10 miles of the center of Pittsburgh but as with many office buildings the radio reception can be poor.  I spent the extra money on this unit based on the reviews posted and was greatly disappointed.  I only receive 2 stations clearly and one of the two is only because the transmitter is located within 5 miles of my office.  I don't even get other station unclearly. NOTHING.  In addition, most every time I get up from my desk the radio cracks a few times and shuts off, also clearing all of the memory (time and preset stations).  Sometimes it won't even turn back on until I unplug it for a while and then plug it back in.  I contacted Sangean about my issues.  Their first response was only to send me 4 or 5 links on how to improve my radio reception.  WAIT, that's why I spent the money to buy this unit in the first place! They ignored my complaint about the radio shutting off. I contacted them again and stated that the links were useless and ask again about my unit shutting off.  They only responded with 3 or 4 links on controlling static electricity in the home.  Now if you work in an office building you know that you have NO CONTROL over the climate in the building.  Therefore, Sangean's help was USELESS AGAIN.  I contacted them a third time about the same issues and never received a response.\n\nOver my career I spent several years as general manager for a large nation wide electronics chain, so I'm not ignorant when it comes to electronic equipment.  I have never seen a piece of electronic equipment behave like this.  In addition, if I would have ignored a customer problem like Sangean has I would have been fired!\n\nBottom line is I would NOT recommend this unit to anyone and based on my dealings with Sangean I will not purchase one of their products ever again.;HUGE dissapointment
50;21.0;5.0;32.0;Let me say up front that I ordered the Sangean PR-D5 AM/FM radio with the expectation that it would provide excellent (not just good) AM reception. I based my expectations on the overwhelmingly positive reviews it has garnered on many internet sites. Since I live in a rural area, radio reception is an iffy proposition sometimes, particularly for AM stations. I was, therefore, eager to see if this radio lived up to its reputation and I am gratified to report I was not disappointed. Thanks to its benchmark 200mm ferrite antenna, the PR-D5 brings in distant AM stations with ease...including the station that broadcasts my favorite baseball team's games. I have detected no drift and that means once I have tuned in a station it remains locked in for as long as I choose to listen to it. Selectivity has proved to be very good, too, and it is capable of picking out faint stations without the interference of other nearby signals. FM reception is outstanding, as well, and all of the stations to which I enjoy listening come in clearly. Compared to my Sony ICF-SW7600GR, the Sangean has very nearly the FM sensitivity as the Sony and significantly better AM reception, which is high praise, indeed. The controls are blessedly simple and easy to operate, a distinct advantage, in my opinion. The display is large, easy to read, and thankfully clear of much of the unnecessary clutter that afflicts many radios these days. Sound quality is remarkably good for a radio this small, making the listening experience a happy one. Construction quality is quite respectable: there are no loose pieces, no mysterious rattles, and no hiccups in its operation to annoy me: Sangean's QC department was on its toes when they produced this radio!\n\nTo sum up my opinions of the Sangean PR-D5 radio, it provides exactly the performance you would want from a small portable radio, with no bad habits, and at a very fair price. I recommend it very highly.;Punches Above Its Weight
27;22.0;1.0;24.0;I was so excited about this radio.  The reception was good and it was very easy to use.  However, after fewer than four months' use, the speakers cut in and out.  This morning they stopped working entirely.  I would not recommend, especially considering the price for this unit.;Doesn't work after less than four months.
23;23.0;1.0;20.0;"Stopped working a few weeks ago.  Display says, ""PWR FAIL"", changed batteries, tried power cord, no change.  Finally got around to returning it.  VERY DISSAPONTED to learn an item with a ship date of June 3 has a return window expired date of July 8.  Don't most electronic items like this have a year warranty!?!?!?  Very poorly written owners manual, no trouble shooting section, I could not look up what ""PWR FAIL"" means or how to correct it.";Stopped working after six months and Amazon's return policy says I can't return it after only one month!!!
8;24.0;1.0;10.0;I bought this radio off Amazon in June of this year.  After three months of infrequent use (definitely not every day use) I went to turn it on this morning and nothing happened.  I switched from battery power (the batteries were a week old) to AC and the radio still refused to turn on.  $63 up in smoke!;Worked Great Until It Didn't
36;25.0;5.0;20.0;Looked all over for a quality clock radio and finally saw this in Amazon.  Priced right.  Great reception, no more fuzzy sounds from those cheap radios.  Easy to use and looks good.  Only complaint is wish when plugged in with the transformer that the time LCD stays on so I can see the time.;Great reception and sound for small radio
55;26.0;5.0;22.0;This is a great radio for AM reception, with a powerful, thick, long antenna. The great AM reception is THE reason you buy this particular radio. That is its biggest selling point by far. I live 90 minutes north of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, but at night, when radio stations are allowed by FCC regulations to increase their power, I can pick stations up as far away as Atlanta, New Orleans, New York City, Boston, Cleveland, etc. WBBM 780 Chicago comes in crystal clear.\n\nA word of caution: To get the best reception of these farther away stations, you need to have the radio in a room where you don't have other electronic devices. For example, my living room has a 42 inch TV and a 2.4 Ghz wireless phone. So my radio gets lots of static in that room.\n\nThe kitchen is better, but not the best because of the microwave, which runs on the same frequency and causes interference even when you are not using it, though the interference is much worse when it is in use. You also don't want to run the radio near your wireless router.\n\nThe best places would be a room with no wireless interference (preferable a 2nd floor room), or outside.\n\nThis radio also has a digital clock with an alarm and is advertised as portable. But it does not have a handle, and is a bit heavier than I would want a portable radio to be.\n\nThe FM reception is great. The sound quality of the FM is not as good as a car stereo or a 20 plus watt boombox, and you certainly wouldn't want it to replace a stereo system. But the FM sound quality is way better than the average transistor radio.\n\nYou also want to keep in mind that if you live in the northern part of the country as I do, you may need to point the front of the radio to the southwest or south east to get the best reception of those further away stations. It's par for the course that you will sometimes have to do a rain dance with your radio until you have it positioned to get the clearest signal.\n\nBut I am glad I own this radio and it is worth the bucks.;Tremendous AM Reception, Respectable FM Sound
35;27.0;5.0;19.0;I was looking for a really good table radio for my wife who listens to NPR whenever she is in the house. I wanted a radio that had excellent channel reception and good sound quality. Even though the Sangean is a fairly small radio it met the mark on both important counts. So she loves the little thing. Fast forward a year later and she mentions in passing how nice it would be to have a second radio just like it so she could take it with her when she travels- something nice to listen to in the motel room other than the cheesey clock radios they usually have. So I buy her another one, this time in black for christmas and she is so happy! Now she keeps one in the bathroom and one on the counter in the kitchen- she used to have to unplug it and move it back and forth. This radio has no bells and whistles, not even a CD player- just a nice little radio with good sound.;bought two
11;28.0;1.0;11.0;The radio that I received is not the same as the one I ordered,, as seen in the picture.  I ordered a white radio and the one I received is a transparent one.  To make things worse it does not have an alarm button - it is blocked and there is no title on top of the button. (see picture).  It does not have an Aux In input either, so I cannot listen to music from my mobile phone. It is blocked (see picture)  I already own a Sangean PR-D5 radio, and I was very happy with it which is why I purchased a second one. That's how I know that the button is missing.

75;29.0;2.0;23.0;"I have the same problem as one or more previous reviewers.  It worked flawlessly for the first few weeks.  Then, it started to having problems turning on, without messing around alot with the buttons.  Strange.  It shuts itself off for no apparent reason, or will stop playing the station it was tuned in to, and just start scanning repeatedly thru the whole range of the digital channels.  It has been doing this for the last couple of weeks, so I got a hold of Beach Audio, who I purchased from thru Amazon, and requested a RMA.  It took them about a week to get back to me with an RMA number, so now I will begin the process of returning this thing. It's kind of too bad, because we really liked the design and portability of the radio, and it's ""apparent"" overall build quality. I guess looks aren't everything - there must be some circuit board instability issue or something similar. I will look for a similar radio, but one with more reliability.";Same problems as other reviews (lemon?)
78;30.0;4.0;22.0;I purchased this item on line here and recieved it within 4 days. Unfortunately the unit had a defective AC power adaptor. After plugging the unit in, the power kept dis-connecting. Further examination determined the problem to be in the connecting jack of the 9volt adaptor, likely a loose wire at the jack, as just moving the wire slightly disconnected the power. Unfortunately, I had to return the whole unit, rather than just the adaptor.\n\nWithin a 10 days a new unit arrived, and I am quite happy with the radio.\nThe sound quality is very good, with a rich sound that makes music especially enjoyable. A slight dis-advantage, is the lack of tone control, or bass/treble controls. Again, considering the 2 relatively small speakers, the sound quality is quite amazing. But if you prefer deeper bass or higher treble, you may be disappointed.\n\nAs for reception of radio stations, I have found it to be quite sensitive. I receive all local, or near-local high-power FM stations (Bangor, Ellsworth, Mid-Coast and DownEast Maine, all within 50 miles)in full stereo with the antenna fully-extended . Also take note there are no external jacks for AM or FM antennas,so if you are in extreme fringe AM or FM areas, this may not be a good set for you.  There is a Stereo/mono FM switch for improved reception of weaker stations. At 175 miles I can receive WHOM Mount Washington, NH in Mono, but stereo is quite noisy.\nAs for the RDS, surprisingly only 2 local stations have it, and it is quite useful in identifying the songs played. I expected more stations to utilize the feature, but it was not my primary reason for buying this set.\n\nOn AM, I was pleased to receive many high-power Boston AM stations (200 miles away, across open water) My local 5,000-watt AM station, 20 miles away comes in perfectly. Note also on AM that the set is quite directional, so proper orientation is a factor, especially if AM is your primary listening choice. There seems to be a very sensitive ferrite rod AM antenna mounted internally beneath the FM antenna. I do find it is quite sensitive to computer generated noise, so if your computer is anywhere near the radio, expect poor reception of weaker stations.\nNight-time reception of AM can be quite impressive, and this could be a good receiver for those who enjoy long-distance night-time DX reception.\n\nThe timer/alarm function is very convenient to use, and it makes a great radio for dozing off to at night, and/or waking up. Battery use appears to be reasonable, although I have yet to use a full set of batteries on it (6 C-cells) Having the battery level indicator is a nice feature.\n\nOne other added bonus is the AUX input, for plugging in a CD player or other device.\n\nFor the price, I find this to be a great little radio. My only other minor grudge is that it does not have a handle. Although it is lightweight and fairly portable, it just doesn't lend itself for a lot of mobility.\n\nAgain, for the price, I find this a good bargain.;Great radio!!
72;31.0;5.0;21.0;Wow! What great sound from a little radio! I first ordered one of these as a gift for my brother, who lives in the inland empire. He was amazed at the quality of sound. It was because of the reviews I read on this and different radios that I decided on this particular model. I also ordered one for myself to use in my kitchen, but the sound is so good that I carry it around with me and use it in different rooms in preference to the radios I have in these other rooms. I get clear reception on stations that only give me problems on my other radios.  I highly recommend this model. It's a real winner!;A Five Star Product

47;33.0;5.0;17.0;Bought the Sangean PR-D5P. Here is my initial review after having the radio for 4 days. I cannot comment concerning battery life at the moment\n\npros\n1) small, lightweight with or without batteries\n2) I am not an AM band talk show dxer but I heard AM stations from all around.

Comparisons are opinions of the persons making them and others will certainly disagree or agree. I compared the Sangean PR-D5P to the Bose wave radio for sound quality. The Sangean did good compared with the Bose but is not in the same class of the Bose. If I had to choose between the 2. the Sangean for $72 or the Bose for $500 I would choose the Sangean. I do not think the price  difference between the 2 can be justified based on sound. I own a Henry Kloss Model 88 which i think is a better sounding radio than the Bose and at the time i bought it, it was around half the price. I like radios and own many.\n\nImprovements for the Sangean PR-D5P which would for me make it a $100-$125 radio which I would purchase if made available..\n1) Fold in handle\n2) on/off display light switch\n3)more presets\n4) remote control\n5)weather stations\n6) 3 inch speakers\n\nOver all I am very happy with this Sangean radio.;great little radio
13;34.0;5.0;10.0;I built my first radio when I was eight years old back in the early '60's.  Knew from that moment on I would make electronics my career when I was a grown up.  Work in the engineering departments in radio and TV broadcasting over the years and serviced many consumer electronics products too.  So I just wanted to let you know I have some experience behind me to base my review upon.\n\nMy wife was getting tired of lugging around her 40 year old Sony portable which is an excellent unit and still works great after all these years so I went off to the various stores looking for something of equal quality with modern features that would bring in all the signals just as well as that 40 year old Sony has done.  I was really astounded at the lack of availability of decent quality portable radios in the stores so I hopped online to see what I could find.  Came across the Sangean brand, checked out the company, read so many great reviews, so I decided to get one for my wife.\nProblem I had was which Sangean model to get..haha.  Well I decided on this one, the PR-D5, and I am absolutely floored at how well built this unit is, how great it pulls in the signals, and how sweet it sounds.  It pulls in more signals than the ole Sony, and no crosstalk whatsoever.  This is truly a great product and I'm so glad Sangean has made a commitment to produce really high quality portable radios in today's super high tech world.  Oh yea, my wife loves this unit and she uses it daily as she did with the good ole 40 year old Sony.;My wife was getting tired of lugging around her 40 year old Sony portable which is an excellent unit and still works great after
79;35.0;5.0;20.0;I bought this radio for a senior citizen in a marginal reception area.  It was an ideal choice.  The strong AM antenna allowed clear reception of a station that other radios in the home could not bring in as well.  It programs easily and has five preset buttons for each of the bands (AM & FM), much as a car radio.  Although digitally tuned, a dial does the work, & below that is the volume dial.  This proved easy for the 90 year old user of the unit. The radio has non slip feet and a very nice appearance, so it looks great & is not too big to fit on a small table.  A nice bonus for me, when I visit, is that it has an AUX input, so I can attach my IPOD or CD portable.  The FM reception is clean and the dual speakers were ideal to bring a little stereo sound into the room. The radio can easily be used as a bedside unit, as it's dial can light and can function as a clock radio complete with sleep mode in 15 minute increments.  It is a bargain.;Stylish cleverly designed  hi-perforing radio
34;36.0;4.0;15.0;"This little radio is awesome. The size is great for sitting on a desk, which is where I have mine. It would also fit perfectly on any shelf or table top/work station. I believe it is even streamline, and light enough to hang on the wall! Just get some of those command hangers and stick her up there haha!\n\nOk, now to the ""radio"" function..... Its great! The sound is awesome, more than enough to fill a normal size room. The music is deep and ""bassy,"" and sounds great. It gets great reception, no more frustration over only half of my area radio stations coming in at any given time!\n\nI also purchased a 3.5 male to male audio cable, so I can plug my Iphone into the auxillary jack on this radio and listen to my own music. The cable was only 3 bucks and is 6 feet long, so I find this much more convenient than a ""docking station"" type radio. The cable was made for large cases, and it accomodates my otterbox perfectly.\n\nThe radio may seem a little pricey, but because of its size, reception, and beautiful, ""more than room filling sound,"" it is deffinately worth the price.\n\nThe ONLY reason that I am giving this radio 4 stars instead of 5, is because it only comes with 5 radio station presets. (you get 5 for AM and 5 for FM) If your the type of person that just works and plays the radio on one staion all day, then no problem. This radio picks up lots of stations though (at least in my area) I would like to be able to store at least 10! All that would need to be added would be a 5+ button, and you could use the same 5 preset buttons to store another 5 stations, for a total of 10 presets...then this would be the mother of all radios!\n\nAll in all, I am extreemly satisfied with this radio! I also love the fact that I got it in black! It matches my TV and Computer nicely. If you enjoy listening to the radio, then you should be listening to this one!";Great Reception, Great Sound.
56;37.0;5.0;17.0;I researched several brands and models looking for a radio with excellent AM reception as we live in the country and are remote from big city signals.  This radio was touted to have all the features we were looking for and after opening the box and hooking it up, we were pleasantly surprised at just how much better it performed than our home entertainment desktop model.  The am reception is as good as we could expect from even a top of the line radio costing much more, but this radio performs beautifully.  We were equally impressed with the quality and volume of sound from its built in speakers, they provide ample volume and clarity even from a distance.  The radio is sleek, beautifully designed, simple to operate, lightweight and functional.  If there were to be a drawback or a downside, it wuld have to be that it has no carrying handle, but the back is designed with a comfortable lip that allows it not to slip from your fingers when you pick it up.  We can deal with the loss of a standard handle, it clearly was designed with quality in mind.  I would recommend this radio to anyone, and it is seldom that I am so overwhelmingly satisfied with an internet purchase.  The purchase price was half of the radio we started to buy and I am convinced that it would have been hard pressed to compete with the features this little beauty gives us!  This is one purchase that made my day!;Packs a lot of features for a reasonable price!
20;38.0;5.0;11.0;After reading some of these reviews on the PR-D5 I have to wonder whether they are talking about the same product. This is a fantastic radio, great value for the money, simple to operate and has great sound from its stereo speakers, sound that rivals way more expensive radios. There are no Bass and Treble adjustments on this radio but I find it is not needed. The balance is just right for me. The quality of the stereo sound is wonderful and rivals the sound from more expensive stereo systems. Remember, this is a portable unit, not a house Hi-Fi system.\n\nI saw a review that said there were no AM stations that could be heard. There are three inputs with this radio that can be selected using the push button (labeled 'Step/Band') in the front: 1) FM 2) AM 3) Auxiliary (you can plug your iphone, ipad, etc, in and play it through the radio). If the input was at the AUX position then there wouldn't be any AM stations playing. The reviewer should carefully check to ensure that they didn't accidentally select the AUX position.\n\nThe PR-DE pulls in FM stations very clearly. In case you are picking up a weak FM station (station is far away from you) there is a Stereo/Mono switch on the side of the radio. Selecting the Mono setting will eliminate the hiss on weak stations. Very nice feature. So far I haven't had to extend the FM antenna, the stations I listen to were all coming in loud and clear! The PR-D5 is superior in picking up FM compared to the rest of the 'many' radios I own.\n\nThe AM ferrite antenna is built into the set. It doesn't use the telescoping antenna for AM. Just lay the radio flat and turn it to get the best sound. The Sangean PR-D5 has a 200 mm ferrite bar which is larger than the average radio has. This results in superior AM performance. One reviewer mentioned that they don't hear many stations during the daytime. That is the way AM propagation works. During the Daytime you will hear local AM stations well, The AM band comes 'alive' in the evening and you can hear stations from hundreds ( or more) miles away. The local stations reduce their power which also allows you to hear the other less powerful stations which are now in the clear. Not hearing AM stations in the daytime is not a radio problem, it's the way the AM band works.\n\nI travel between upstate NY and Washington, DC and I love to listen to 880 AM WCBS New york station. In the evening it comes in load and clear from about 300 miles away. Many other DX (distance) stations can be heard throughout the AM band during the evening hours. This radio does a great job in picking them up. Because it's a portable, the PR-D5 can be rotated to get the best sound on AM. If this was a bigger tabletop radio that would not be so easy or feasible to do. It's a portable but the sound is comparable to a big tabletop radio. Rich tones and great stereo from the two built in speakers. To test this out, find a classical music FM stereo station and listen yourself. It's a beautiful sound for just a $60 radio.\n\nSetting the time on the built in clock is very simple to do. The easiest way is to tune to a FM station that is broadcasting in RDS (Radio Data System). You can tell because the display will have text scrolling about the radio station that is currently selected. Once a RDS FM station is playing then press and hold the 'CT/Display' button (on the front of the radio) for two seconds and it will update the time from the radio station. Couldn't be easier! You can also set in manually by pressing and holding the tuning knob for 2 sections. When doing this the hour display will blink and you can turn the tuning knob to advance the hours. Press the tuning knob one more time and you can adjust the minutes, press it again to exit out.\n\nOnce the clock/time is set you can set the alarm to wake to music. you can also set the radio to turn off after playing for a set time (sleep mode). Once the clock is set it continues to display. You can see the time display if there is any light in the room. You can also press the 'CT/Display' button to have the display line lighted for about 10 seconds. Not having the display lit all the time is not a problem. That would unnecessarily drain the battery and is not really needed. With any ambient light in the room, the display can be read just fine.\n\nThe Sangean PR-D5 takes 6 'C' type batteries or you can use the included wall plug. If you use Alkaline batteries, they will last a very long time. The manual says 70 hours of play. I have gone several months without having to change the battery. I also purchased a 12 pack of C Alkaline batteries for about a dollar a piece, total of $12. If the batteries last 3 months then that is about .13 cents a day for the added advantage of being ready for a power outage and the flexibility of easily moving the radio from room to room at will without needing to unplug and replug the wall power supply. You can also use  rechargeable batteries which work fine but are not as powerful and will not last as long as Alkalines. The rechargeable C type batteries are not cheap plus you need to also purchase a recharger and recharge the batteries (which can take several hours, depending on your charger). I prefer to just buy the alkalines, since they last over three months.\n\nThe PR-D5 does not have a carrying handle but I don't see that as a problem. The radio, even with the 6 'C' batteries loaded is not that heavy and you can easily pick it up to move it from room to room.\n\nIf you are in the market for a portable AM/FM radio and you are looking for a well-made (constructed), affordable radio that delivers on quality sound, picks up FM and AM stations from hundreds of miles away and does it well, then for $60 this is a no-brainer. Great radio!;Outstanding AM/FM portable radio
6;39.0;3.0;6.0;"This was supposed to be the ultimate DX machine for AM radio. Well, I didn't find it to be; at least not the one I got. It's a decent radio, but it's not stupendous. It exhibits soft muting between stations. Weaker stations drop down quite far in volume and if you didn't turn up the volume, you'd think there was nothing there. The sound quality is OK, but also not particularly stellar. It plays in stereo but unless you're sitting right in front of the radio you would never hear it because the speakers are so close together. If you crank it up, it produces a decent amount of volume for a portable radio but it's not ""loud"" by any means. My overall rating is ""meh"". But it does work OK and if you're just looking for a middle-of-the-road table top or portable set, by all means go for it. It does the job.";OK but not great
7;40.0;1.0;6.0;Revised review.  Sound is good for FM but AM which is what I listen to has horrible horrible interference.  I followed the instructions and placed the radio away from AC adaptor and tried in various locations and nothing helped.  Returned it.  I am somewhat dismayed I can't rely on Amazon reviews as this should have been a good radio and is worse than the one I have now for $10.;Five Stars
9;41.0;5.0;7.0;I did a LOT of online shopping and it  paid off with this very fine little portable.  First I wondered about the price but further checking told me it was a better PORTABLE (with C batteries) than most.  Controls are simple and pretty neat for ole man and two speakers are very good for size.  I like more base, not much treble, so it suits me well-----some may want a choice switch?  Reception is excellent usually without extending the antenna very high.  C batts play a looong time (copper tops) ---- I stopped counting at 26 hrs and haven't run them down yet!!  (low to med volume).  No top foldable handle is fine for me-----they can break or get in the way.  It's small enough to grasp by the ridge on the back.  Some want the digital readout to stay lit but I think that's a battery saver feature.  Maybe a choice of backlight (on fulltime) would be nice?  I usually can read it without the backlight on especially in dark room.  OF course, more options----more $$.\nMost important, it's a well built, user friendly, compact, two speaker portable with long battery life and very handy for moving around.\nVery happy with features and the sound with a reasonable size and weight.;Quality portable
48;42.0;5.0;14.0;"Let me start off by saying that I am the type of person who always takes reviews with a grain of salt, and I rarely comment unless I have a very strong opinion one way or another. I did read lots and lots of reviews about radios because I found that being in SW Virginia I don't have options of places to see one of these in person so I relied very heavily on what people told me about their experience.\n\nI got this radio about 2 months ago and it hasn't been off much since! I have taken it to work with me, had it on the back patio, used it as a bedside radio, and even entertained a small party with it (it is very loud and clean for a radio of its size)\n\nThoughts:\n-No handle on top makes transport tough but this radio is super light so it is easy to get over (I think the AC adapter on the power cord weighs more than the radio itself- but don't be fooled this little guy is sturdy and very well built. The buttons and knobs are all very crisp and exceptional)\n-Digital tuning, in my opinion, is a very dangerous thing. No minor adjustments means you either get the station or you are out of luck, but in my experience with this radio so far, the tuner is dead on.\n-It is sturdy-I work in a greenhouse and it got knocked off of a table onto a concrete floor from about three feet up and one little scratch later, it is still playing like a champ.\n-The AM reception is out of this world. I googled ""clear channel stations"" and went all the way through the dial one night and correctly identified all of them. I live in the the mountains of SW VA, and reception of any kind is difficult but this radio does the trick. I go to bed with 650 AM out of Nashville playing and it sounds like Eddie Stubbs is in my bedroom the reception is so good. Most people think I am a bit old fashioned for it, but I love listening to 740 out of Toronto for big band music and then switching to the Grand Ole Opry out of Nashville. It is fun and sounds great!\n-The AUX input is great for plugging an ipod in. Don't be fooled into buying one of those ipod docking radios because the sound quality and radio reception on those in the same price range don't compare to this with a $10 adapter cord from Walmart.\n-FM is great as well. I listen to a station that is about 50 miles away as the crow flies that usually only comes in well in a good car radio but this radio get it fine.\n-Haven't tried the battery power option on this yet but with spring camping and fishing trips coming up, I will probably give it a whirl.\n\nIf I had more money, I would buy one for work, and one for home. Everyone laughs at me because I carry it around with me now.\n\nThe thing that will amaze you is how talk and music sounds on this radio. You don't know what you are missing until you hear it on a radio of this quality- and for half the price of some of the radios in its class. My buddies went from mocking me for spending $60 on a radio in the day of smartphones and high speed internet to asking me to bring it upstairs from my bedroom when they stop by after work so that we could listen to it.";Best $60 I have ever spent
61;43.0;1.0;15.0;I will return this radio.  I bought it to get the FM stations my car gets, but it does not.  In fact, it gets the same exact reception of FM stations as a $10 radio I own.  Perhaps the addition of a high quality FM antenna would make a difference, but unlike many high end radios, this one does not have jack or screws where another FM antenna can be attached.  The silver whip FM antenna it came with has absolutely no effect whether it is fully extended, fully compacted, half way up, or pointed left, right, or in any other direction.  If you are looking to get FM stations your car can get this radio may disappoint you severely.;Terrible FM Reception
5;44.0;3.0;5.0;Mostly liked this radio, but the deal-breaker was the extra static and interference on weak AM stations when using the supplied AC adapter.  No such issue when using batteries.  A separate single sheet explains that AC switching power supplies can cause AM noise and recommends the radio be at least 1 foot from the power supply, which I did, but I couldn't detect any difference in the extra static using the AC adapter as a function of distance from the radio.  For strong local AM & FM stations, the sound was crystal clear using battery or AC adapter.;Static and Interference for weak AM stations using supplied AC adapter
24;45.0;3.0;10.0;Pros -\n+ small\n+ good sound\n+ good reception\n\nCons -\n- AC adapter is big and covers 2 sockets on power strip\n- Clock does not stay on when radio is on.  To see the time you have to turn the radio off\n- Clock does not stay illuminated.  To see the time in the dark, you have to turn on the radio, then off.  Then the clock will be illuminated briefly.;Meh
65;46.0;3.0;13.0;The main reason I got this radio was bcuz of its slim, compact design to fit on a narrow shelf. It doesn't have any CD player or tape deck to clutter up the unit and increase its size. Reception is very good for both AM & FM. This unit has one serious omission: no bass-treble tone control. The resulting default sound quality is still very good for FM stereo music,in fact it's amazing for such a little radio. However,a tone control would seriously help the voice clarity when listening to AM talk. Keep this in mind if you like listening to AM talk.;FM stereo music sounds great, AM talk sounds so-so
69;47.0;5.0;13.0;The Sangean PR-D5 is an excellent stereo radio with an electronic Radio Data System feature that permits automatic clock setting by tuning in to stations equipped with this feature. Like a Bose, it has a 3.5mm stereo auxiliary-in audio jack (for a CD Walkman, tape deck, or computer), a full-range and mellow tone with excellent bass and treble, but it works on batteries (not included) or an automobile accessory plug (not included) as well as AC power with the included adapter. It is appealing and pleasant in appearance, has a small footprint, and is not too heavy to carry even when loaded with six C-cell batteries. One note: I found that the manual is incorrect in stating that the time can be set manually with the radio either on or off. In my experience, the radio must be off. And don't look for a Time Set knob to press: the station tuning dial doubles for this purpose.;Comparable to a Bose Wave Radio, but portable
39;48.0;5.0;11.0;Just recieved it , took only a couple of minutes to set my favorite stations , time and alarm , TONE quality is nice .\nI like it !!!!! I got it in Black , and I have to tell my son the radio he he got me 20 years ago has just been replaced LOL\nI purchased it thru Amazon fron Ant on line .\nThank you , was a good buy .;It DOES WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO !
49;49.0;4.0;11.0;I read some of the reviews on Amazon and some people said the Sagean PD-D5 was comparable to the bose acoustic radio.  I said to myself, this can't be.  I own four bose radios and have yet to find a radio the compares to the sound of a Bose.  I went ahead an ordered one.  Curiosity got the best of me.  I have to admit, that it sounds almost, if not a tad better than the Bose.  There is a fine line between them.  I find the Sangean to have a sharper and clearer sound when listening to talk radio, like NPR.  I am 100% satisfied with this radio.  It brings in FM stations quite clearly weather I use the AC adapter or just batteries.  I highly recommend this radio.  For the price, you can't beat it.  The music is also clear and sharp.;COMPARES TO BOSE
37;50.0;5.0;10.0;I did not pay that much attention to the size when I bought this but it is pretty small. This is a quality radio and has excellent am and fm reception. The sound quality is great. It says that it is portable but there is no handle to carry it. I would highly recommend this radio.;great LITTLE radio
73;51.0;5.0;12.0;One reviewer was annoyed by what he considered a stereo effect when listening to talk radio.  I listen to talk radio a lot and have never experienced this dual voice effect the reviewer complained about.  In addition, the music quality of the radio is excellent.  I have never experienced any problem with the reception of any channel I want to hear.  Overall I consider this an excellent purchase and worth the price.;Pleased with decision to purchase Sangean PR-D5
68;52.0;2.0;11.0;The Radio is smoking hot on AM. FM leaves much to be desired. It does have RDS though.\nThe Sangean PR-D5 is a battery hog. Have plenty on spare cells on hand If you are not using the AC adapter. Also, my radio just froze up after only a few weeks use. It would light up when turned on, but did nothing. Since it was a gift, Sangean would not fix it because I did not have the receipt. Luckily, it started working again, but to be honest, I will never buy another Sangean product. Too much $$ for what you get, and I am not happy with the customer service. A better rig would be a Kaito.;Great AM Radio, FM is mediocre
51;53.0;3.0;10.0;I wanted a radio that got good AM reception so I could listen to Coast To Coast at night.  I live in an area, (central Illinois) where the reception is bad.  If I got a station it would fade out.  This radio was advertized to have great AM reception and it was a good price so I bought it.  I now get three AM stations with 'my program' but they still all fade out and in. (at least they usually come back in)  The best station is Clevland!  I get one FM station with 'my program' but it is usually faded out.  The ease of use is great and the sound is very nice.  A basic radio with nice digital features.  I like the manual tuning and volume dials on the side. I am disapointed that the reception is not better. At least I can listen to most of the program now.;Sangean radio
58;54.0;5.0;10.0;Previouly, I have had two different clock radio's that had poor AM & FM reception.  With the Sangean PR-D5P I am able to get the AM stations that I have been wanting to listen to for years.  I can get a station that is 300 miles away that I have never been able to get in the past.  As an added bonus, I am also able to get KNX in Los Angeles and that is two states away.  The reception is great and I really enjoy listening to these stations.  I also like the FM quality of the sound that comes from the two speakers.  I listen to the radio late at night and in the early morning hours when I wake up and the sound & reception are great.  I would like to have more station preset buttons, but with the reception that I haven't had before, I am not complaining.  I like the feature of the light on the dial automatically shutting off after just a few seconds so it isn't bright at night.;Great AM reception
15;55.0;1.0;6.0;A very nice radio with good quality sound but i found the reception to be no better thn any cheaper radio i've used. The preset buttons would have been great if i could get more than one station. Do not recommend spending the extra money if you work in an office away from windows like i do as reception is terrible.;Reception poor if used in offices away from windows.
31;56.0;5.0;8.0;When I am interested in buying a new product, I read the reviews to find out what other people think of the product.  In this case the product is the Sangean PR-D5 AM/FM portable radio. A problem in doing this is how much credence to give to the reviews.  Some of the  comments about the PR-D5 show a lack of understanding on how radios work and on how radio waves are propagated. The performance of a radio should be evaluated during daylight hours when propagation conditions are very stable, and not at night when propagation conditions are very unstable. Some reviewers blamed the unstable performance at night to the radio rather than the propagation conditions.\n\nThe external whip antenna is for FM reception only. Adjusting this antenna may improve the FM reception. The AM antenna is inside the radio and rotating the radio may improve AM reception. Some of the reviewers seemed to be unaware of this.(Judging from their comments.) The manual could be more helpful in this area.\n\nWhat do I think of the PR-D5? It is a remarkably good AM/FM radio. Sensitivity is excellent on both AM and FM. The AM band (on all radios) is susceptible to interference from computers, microwave ovens, calculators, telephones and any number of electrical devices. The more sensitive the radio, the more susceptible it is to this type of interference.  One reviewer thought his old radio was better than the PR-D5 because the old radio was less susceptible to interference.  ( Less sensitive, and therefore better?)\n\nThe audio quality is outstanding on both AM and FM. Some of the older reviews say that there is too much bass in the AM band and it is difficult to understand speech.  That might have been the case in earlier production units, but it is not true in the one I have. It is not unusual for manufacturers to continue  making improvements after they have been selling the product for some time.\n\nI have been interested in electronics for over 50 years. I have owned portable radios costing $500, and table model radios costing almost $2,000.  As far as I am concerned, the Sangean PR-D5 is the most cost effective radio that I ever purchased. (The best performer per dollar.);A superb radio-- The Sangean PR-D5
66;57.0;3.0;9.0;"The Sangean PR-D5 is very easy to use, and it has very sensitive AM reception. From my perspective, the sound quality is poor, with too much upper bass and muffled treble, which makes voices hard to understand. If Sangean had provided full-range bass and treble controls on the PR-D5, then some of this sound quality issue could have been fixed.\n\nThe 10 kHz tuning step on AM is sometimes a limitation, because there is no way to ""tune around"" hets (i.e., tones) that may accompany a desired signal. A digital radio like the CCRadio 2, with 1 kHz tuning steps, can get around this issue.\n\nThe bottom line is that I bought the PR-D5 to listen mostly to news and talk on AM. Since the sound quality is so muffled, it isn't acceptable for my purposes. Almost every other radio I own has better voice quality on AM than the PR-D5.";Very good AM reception, but poor sound quality
14;58.0;5.0;5.0;"Perfect in every way.  Every aspect of this machine has been intelligently engineered to be simple, yet exacting.  Take the digital tuner, accessed by the tuning knob on the side rolls to let you tune like an old-fashioned analog radio but with soft little clicks to tell you each 0.1 increment of frequency change you're making, and the display that shows exactly what frequency to which you're tuning.  Two high-quality speakers deliver Bose-like sound (having had Bose radios before, I can assure you the sound is full, resonant, nontinny, like a Bose, yet never thumpy or causing the radio to vibrate, like some of the cheaper digital boombox I've used in the past (http://www.amazon.com/Creative-D80-Wireless-Bluetooth-Speaker/dp/B004X28I0A).  A 3.5-mm line input lets you effortlessly hook up your mp3 player to the radio, and best of all (again unlike the aforementioned cheaper boombox) the volume knob does indeed actually modulate the volume of the mp3 input.  The up-to-the-minute RDS (Radio Data System) display scrolls whatever outgoing data accompanies the radio signal (like the name of the artist and the name of the song for FM music stations), then unobtrusively shifts back into showing the time when you turn the radio off.  Pre-sets make it easy to tune five favorite FM stations, and five AM stations.  The AC power supply ensures you won't have to add this radio to the growing list of electronic gadgets that constantly need to be charged, yet it also accepts 6 old-school C batteries, if you want to take it to the beach.  The 10-inch-wide by 5-and-a-half-inch high size (plus leave a little room for the unobtrusive but effective antenna that picks up even low-signal-strength college stations without having to even be extended) makes it a perfect size for a 12-inch-high bookshelf or pretty much anywhere.  The brief instruction manual is carefully written, and in intelligent English.  Finally, the white color is cheerful and brightening.  I like this radio so much I got one for the bathroom, one for the kitchen table, and one for the physical therapy gym where I work (where, by labeling it ""this radio is from the rehab department of a nursing home,"" I hope to shame any prospective thief from taking it).";A radio for the future, with the best elements of the past
71;59.0;5.0;9.0;We purchased this radio as a gift for my 80-year old mother.  The area where she lives has very poor radio reception, only one local station.

I would recommend this radio to anyone, and especially for those who will be using it in a remote area.;Sangean PR-D5 Radio
29;60.0;1.0;7.0;"I purchased this radio specifically because of the ""enormous 200mm ferrite antenna providing the best AM reception you have ever heard"" claim, and am returning this radio because the quality of AM reception is at best equal to a very inexpensive non digital tuning radio I already own. I followed the owner's manual steps to make sure the radio was set correctly for US reception, which it was out of the box.\nUpdate- I purchased the Tecsun PL398BT DSP Digital AM/FM/LW Shortwave Radio and have found the radio I needed- great AM reception.";Poor AM reception

33;63.0;5.0;7.0;I bought this to deal with bad reception at my workplace but did not want to spend a lot of my own money for a workplace radio.

17;65.0;2.0;5.0;"I bought this two years ago to bring in distant AM stations, and in that respect it's excellent. FM sound is also good; and it's handsome, to my eye anyway. But recently it's developed a problem: the ""Step/Band"" button on the top row that switches it between FM, AM, and Aux has started to fail. More often than not now it switches not from one band to another but between memory stations on the same band; and if it's not doing that, most of the rest of the time it doesn't do anything at all. In order to get it to switch from band to band you have to press it extremely hard, much harder than anyone should have to push a button on any device. I think there's a membrane below the keyboard that's deteriorating; I tried to clean it by blowing air from an air duster can in and around all the buttons, but it didn't help. In my experience it's a good radio, but the manufacturer's claim that this is the last radio you'll have to buy is not true. Even if you like it at first -- which you probably will -- if it's like mine, you're going to have to replace it in a year or so.";Be careful -- may fail in a year or so

52;67.0;2.0;7.0;I purchased this radio last January.  For 6 months it worked great, the reception was terrific, and I was delighted with my purchase.  However, yesterday it started randomly changing stations, then began scanning for no reason and wouldn't  turn off  when I pressed the power button, next it started displaying random digits, then finally quit working completely.  Even tho there had been no electrical storm, I tried unplugging it so that it would reset after a power surge as per the instruction manual, but all that happened is that I now have a blinking time display, no radio and nothing at all happens no matter which button I press.  I see that a couple of other reviewers have had this problem, so I assume there must be some kind of defect in the circuit.\n\nIf you are lucky enough to buy one that works properly, this is a great radio.  If you have the bad luck to get a defective one as I did, you've bought yourself a blinking clock.;Nice radio, but didn't last long.
32;68.0;2.0;6.0;"After reading the reviews I was expecting this radio to be something ''special"". but it isn't any different, or better than the Sony or GE that we currently have, both of which cost some what less than the Sangean.  We live in the foothills of Central California (2000' elevation) and my husband has a hard time getting the San Francisco Giants games without a lot of static, and I was hoping this radio would pick up the games without all that static, but it didn't.  It doesn't even pick up KNPR clearly and it is in Fresno, which is only about 30+ miles away. I'm glad it is a great radio for some, it just isn't anything special for us.  Maybe we got a lemon!?";Disappointed
80;69.0;2.0;8.0;"After its terrible HD-radio, Sangean makes another loser with the PR-D5. The AM section easily overloads if you are within several miles of an AM station's transmitter. You'll hear the local station faintly in the background of nearly every AM station you tune in. This is because the designers neglected to put in a simple ""LOCAL/DX"" switch like the cheapest radios have, to reduce the signal and thus prevent overload and bleed-through... Even the similarly priced Grundig 350 has an RF attenuator dial FOR AM to prevent this problem, as do other well-designed radios (see the Kaito 2100 for instance). I have 10-buck radios that don't have this problem and are just as sensitive. And orienting the AM antenna doesnt help either. Even though the FM is good, don't buy it.";DESIGN IS FLAWED, AM-SECTION  EASILY OVERLOADS

It picks up FM easily and pulls in the AM talk radio stations quite well.  I don't really use the R.D.S capability, but do now and then notice a title scrolling across when playing music on FM stations pushing R.D.S.  I haven't used external connections since I'm just using it for an office radio.  Good, strong sound, quality reception.;Great for an office environment
62;71.0;5.0;7.0;After reading so many rave reviews of the Sangean PR-D5 radio on Amazon, eHam, RadioIntel and DXer. CA, I sprang for this radio and didn't look back. I ordered the PR-D5 on Monday and had the radio on my doorstep by 1PM today (the next Wednesday)...I guess it helps that Amazon has a huge warehouse here in the greater Phoenix area.  Of course, since I'm retired, free shipping is always a motivator.\n\nThe PR-D5 deserves the rave reviews and has replaced my Sangean PR-D7 radio as my primary office radio.  The AM band capabilities are well documented on the world wide web, but let me say that the FM band is also stellar given the PR-D5's price point, both in terms of reception and sound quality.  There are better sounding tabletop radios in the marketplace, but none have the feature set, flexibility or low initial investment of the Sangean PR-D5.\n\nBTW, the PR-D5 fits very nicely on a stand designed for world band radios.  I'm looking forward too many hours of enjoyment listening to my new PR-D5 and will update this review if I can add to the buzz on this radio.\n\nUpdate December 2009:  I have found that the PR-D5, like most tabletop radios, sounds best when placed on a hard wooden surface, so I no longer use a stand.  I have had this radio for over a month and I am very happy with my purchase.;Best Value 4 Small Tabletop/Portable Stereo Radio
64;72.0;4.0;7.0;I bought my new Sangean PR-D5 to replace a 10 year old Sony.  It will be used during power outages and on camping trips.  I'm no expert and only go by the products performance.  It does a wonderful job of picking up both AM and FM stations in our poor reception area.  I have a passive antenna that I used with my old Sony, but the PR-D5 doesn't need it.  It doesn't improve the reception at all.  I liked it so much I'm buying two more for Christmas presents this year.;I Love It!
67;73.0;3.0;7.0;I bought this radio from Amazon in early July 2009.  Decent sound, good reception in my office.  I basically wanted it for the rated as above average FM reception, which for my purposes, this radio was fine.  At that, I would have rated it 4 stars.  However, I also use the aux in plug for an iPod.\n\nMy problem relates to workmanship.  I leave the radio on my desk at work, so it receives little to no movement.  I leave a 3.5 mm cord in the Aux In plug.  When I want to listen to my iPod, I plug it in to the other end of the patch cord.  I do this maybe twice a week and listen to the radio the other days.  After just over 2 months of this, the Aux In plug has started to short out.  I have to finagle the cord about 1/2 plugged in to get the sound to come out right.  This does not always work, so I often just listen to my iPod through the headphones (that confirms the short is not on that jack on the iPod).\n\nI'm just over the return period for Amazon.  I contacted Sangean support via their website.  They responded within a few hours saying my only option is to return for repair or replacement.  This bothers me as I have a Tivoli PAL at home and use it the same way and have done so for about 3 years.  Not a single problem.  I didn't buy another Tivoli for work as I really didn't want to leave a $150 relatively small radio out on my desk.  Now I own this Sangean and am really concerned with the workmanship for something so basic to simply just stop working.\n\nAny ideas or has anyone else had a similar problem?;Pretty nice, but Aux Line In problem concerns me
41;74.0;2.0;6.0;I bought this radio for use in the bathroom, and have been using it since August on battery power for safety reasons.  It is used about one hour a day at most.  The radio has been going through batteries like there is no tomorrow.  A set of six C cells lasts less than eight weeks.  At this rate I will own Duracell in no time!.  Had I known the battery life was so short I would certainly not have bought it.  Time to move on.;Eats Batteries for Breakfast!
70;75.0;2.0;7.0;This is like the other Sangean I have, which we love, but instead of +/- audio volume the volume is set by a turn-knob on the side.  I found that inconvenient and sloppy, as I use the radio behind and above me in the office -- hard to reach and tend to turn the tuning knob.\n\nAM reception exceptionally good, like the other sangean.  But the FM reception is not good, terrible.;What happened to the volume buttons?  FM reception not good.
43;76.0;2.0;6.0;Unfortunately, this radio does not work in Australia, as the wave lengths are set to jump at a length 10 mghz, and Australian uses 9 mghz. Of this I was unaware when I purchased the radio. It is incredibly expensive to return to America (A$53 to return surface mail). Had I returned the item as you requested, the cost would have been A$89, almost as much as the original cost, and according to your policy, I am likely not to receive a refund should the article not arrive with you in 30 days.  The item itself, I'm sure is OK, but insufficient information is given about this anomaly, and I bought the item blindly as it turned out.\n\nI am considerably out of pocket over this matter, and believe it might have been reasonably avoided was I properly informed. Might I suggest that information concerning such anomalous conditions relating to items for sale be posted with advertisements for their sale.;Difficulties
44;77.0;4.0;6.0;Bought this for our bathroom radio (no electricity, don't ask).\n\nSound:  Very good, solid.  The sound leans more to the bass than I would have guessed.  I listen mainly to public radio, so the bass helps with the voices (with my prior radio, I turned the bass way up and the treble down).  My kids listen to contemporary pop, so again bass is good.\n\nThe player has a stereo/mono switch.  I couldn't hear much difference between the two, which was good and bad.  A little stereo separation may have been nice, but practically difficult given the size and speaker placement.  On the other hand, I notice a big difference between stereo and mono on our regular stereo receiver, so much so that I always need to switch it to mono to cut down on the fuzz sound.  Here, no fuzz.\n\nReception:  So far, rock solid.  Our prior radio, a great RCA model, had some problems with reception but the stations here came in spot on.  I'm using the antennae fully extended against an inside wall.\n\nSize:  Most surprising.  The player is much smaller than I had guessed.  It is a bit narrow, so that freestanding I suspect it may be a bit tippy.  There are four rubber pads on the bottom.  There is no handle or loops for a strap.  A ridge extends on the back side, just below the cut out for the antennae.  If you put your hand over the top, with your fingers under the ridge, your thumb can control the buttons of the front easily.\n\nThe tuner and volume are on the right side.  I suspect that confusing the two will be common, with the tendency to reach for the top button (tuner) to control the volume.  The buttons adjust the volume nicely, no clicks, just smooth control.\n\nThe body is completely plastic but feels like good quality.  The speakers are set back slightly from the covering grill, presumably to avoid damage.\n\nSet-up:  Tuning the stations in to the presets is easy.  There are only five presets, no second level for another set of five presets.  This is OK but it would have been nice to have two levels.  We often use the two levels in other equipment to differentiate between kids and adult stations.\n\nThe sleep function will be nice, in case we walk out and forget to turn off the radio.  Haven't used the alarm.  The LCD panel light up but then shuts off, to preserve battery life I presume.  There's a clock.  There's the obligatory external auxiliary device (a/k/a iPod) plug-in on the right side as well.\n\nThere is no weather radio, which is a disappointment.  How difficult would it have been to add that in?\n\nPower:  Six C-cell batteries.  I guess the C size was a compromise.  D's would have been too heavy and AA two light.  Still C sizes are harder to find, especially in rechargeables.  Still, if this player is anything like the RCA, the batteries may last years. Also, there's a plug in on the right side for AC power and a wall wart comes with the unit (not used by me, see above).\n\nHated to see our old radio die after twenty plus years, but this will be a great replacement.\n\nOctober 2011:  Battery life is short.  My first set of five C cell batteries lasted about 40 hours.  My guess is that the display drains the batteries as radios themselves don't generally suck much power (our old radio, no display, used to last years on a set of batteries).  Replaced with rechargeables and am getting just a little less play time.  Be warned.\n\nOther than that, we love this radio.  Sound is great for the entire family.  I particularly like listening to public radio programs.\n\nOne unexpected use was the auxiliary plug in.  My kids plug their MP3 players in while taking a shower and I use for podcasts.  I don't know if this use drains the battery more or not.\n\nJune 2013:  Still going strong.  Batteries (rechargeable) last about three weeks in our house (four people, in the bathroom), mainly radio listening, probably about an hour a day.;Great portable!  Short battery life!
77;78.0;5.0;7.0;I bought this radio so that we could listen to some remote signals and be able to tune them in electronically.  The radio works great.  The sound is crystal clear and the tuning is very easy.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good radio to listen to both AM and FM.;Great Radio - sound and reception
25;79.0;5.0;5.0;"I bought this for my mom, who is in her 80's and has difficulty with tiny buttons. With Hurricane Sandy behind her, she wanted a radio with a battery-power option. I did a pretty extensive search before choosing the Sangean PR-D5. A ""con"" in a few other reviews, about the Power button in the front, was a real ""pro"" for me. I saw that Sangean has other models -- smaller side switch Power button, more channel presets, maybe some other bells and whistles, but if that's not what you need or want, this model is great. My mom can easily turn it on and off, adjust volume and stations on the side knobs, and save a few favorite stations on the presets. Now... the part I hadn't counted on -- IT SOUNDS GREAT TOO. I could not be happier with this selection. In fact, I'm thinking of buying one for myself!";Perfect for My Needs (Gift)
57;80.0;2.0;6.0;It tunes AM and FM well but the almost no high frequency sounds escape from the speakers, even on FM stations. It sounds a little like a rug or a wall is in front of the unit. It could be defective, or it could be that  it's designed this way.\n\nI actually like the sound of my Sony Shower radio better.\n\nI am returning the product.;Not happy with the osund
45;81.0;5.0;5.0;"Great reception except for some buzzing caused by electronic ballast fluorescent lights in the shop. This usually occurs only on the ""lesser signal"" stations, but otherwise this is great.\nI read a LOT of reviews about this radio, and other similar. Main reason chose this one was Sangean reputation and AM reception. MP3 port was big plus as well.\nControls are really smooth and intuitive and has big sound.\nI thought size might be a negative as I was looking at smaller portable ones, but though this is a bit bigger, it is a really nice size. No, won't fit in a pocket, though perhaps a big jacket. It will easily fit in a fanny pack or backpack.\nSo far, LOVE this thing, which is rare for me.\nI'm the kind that expects quality for my money, no matter how much something is. Just a funny quirk I have. I wish everyone would expect this from manufacturers and maybe we wouldn't get so much crap out there. It just does NOT cost that much to do something right and it seems so many businesses are cutting ridiculous corners or just not thinking things out in their products from a quality consumer / common sense point of view.\n\nI would probably give this thing 10 stars if I could.\nHopefully this opinion will hold out over time.";I'm picky - this radio is GREAT
46;82.0;5.0;5.0;I had suffered from a lot of AM interference when trying to get some stations and was using a pretty decent AM/FM/Short Wave radio.  I'm a former engineer and I read a lot of review on this radio and it was highly recommended.\n\nI live in upstate New York near Rochester.  WHAM 1180 sends out a powerful signal and it was difficult for me to pick up a station (1160) out of Ithaca, pretty distant.  This unit did a wonderful job.\n\nWhen it came I just sat it down next to my existing unit and there was NO comparison.  It performed beautifully.  The digital tuning and having 5 presets for AM and FM is great.  The large display is easy to read and the sound quality is excellent.\n\nIt's just a very nice product at a great price.;BUY THIS RADIO IF YOU WANT GREAT AM!
53;83.0;5.0;5.0;The Sangean PR-D5P is an outstanding AM radio.  I live in a rural area, so I do not have access to many AM radio stations.  The Sangean clearly pulls in a number of AM stations I previously could not receive.  Its performance is far superior to the GE SuperRadio.  I highly recommend it.;Sangean has Winner in PR-D5P
54;84.0;4.0;5.0;The first thing I've noticed about this radio is that its AM performance is OUTSTANDING, and eclipses all other features. If you want a GREAT AM portable at a good price, this is the one to get. I've found that AM performance is incredible even in the daytime when groundwave signals at my location are weak. FM performance is outstanding as well, pulling in stations with ease with no static for the most part.\n\nI disagree with one previous reviewer that the twin speakers makes talk radio sound indistinct. I think it boils down to personal preference. I for one find the reproduction of human speech quite good with this radio's speaker setup.\n\nI own a GE Superradio III and can honestly say this matches it in receiver performance, and far exceeds it when features are taken into account. The Superradio sounds a little better though, but not by much!;Quality radio at a reasonable price
63;85.0;5.0;5.0;I currently own a Sony ICF2010, unfortunately in no long works, but when it did, it was wonderful.  I also own a 20-year-old GE Super Radio and a Sony SW7600GR, both get very good AM reception, but neither of them compare with the PR-D5.  What is astounding to me is that the PR-D5 gets very good AM reception in an office environment.  I listen to a lot of AM and in my opinion the PR-D5 is as good as it gets for the price.  The FM reception is also very good.  The only shortcoming of this radio is the lack of a handle.  It weighs a couple of pounds and should have a handle.;This is a GREAT portable radio

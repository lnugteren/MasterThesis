7;1.0;5.0;1009.0;I have never bought a non-Canon lens because I just love the look, feel, and optical quality of the Canon line particularly the L series lenses.  But I kept reading glowing reviews about this lens.  On multiple websites.  So, I went out and took a look.\n\nFirst impression:  the build quality is not as good as a Canon L series lens.  Duh!  It costs about 1/4 as much for goodness sake.  This is a plastic lens - not metal.  But I must admit that the build quality was pretty darn good.  Better, I think, than the Sigma lenses I've seen.  Fit and finish was very nice and tight.  I'd give the build quality a 4/5.  Not bad.  I figured I could live with it.\n\nNext, I put the lens on my camera.  I'd read reviews complaining about the speed of the focusing.  It may not be quite as quick as my 200 f2.8 L series lens but it was pretty darn good and for my purposes, plenty fast.  A 4.5/5\n\nI'd read reviews complaining about the noise and the fact that the AF was not USM.  I thought the AF worked very quietly.  Not at all distracting and barely discernable.  Noise - not an issue.\n\nThen, I took pictures with the lens and I was absolutely floored!  How in the world did Tamron manage to produce a lens that performed so well optically for such a reasonable price?!  Beautiful contrast, excellent resolution, gorgeous colors, and extremely sharp, particularly above f2.8.  But, f2.8 is very good as well.\n\nObviously the first comparison that comes to mind is between this lens and the Canon 24-70 f2.8 L.  I would say, I kid you not, that this lens is in every respect optically the equal of the Canon or better than the Canon.  I could not believe it.\n\nI tested this lens directly against a brand new copy of the Canon 24-70 f2.8L.  Method: I tested both lenses on a tripod @ F 2.8 and 8.0 @ 28mm 50mm and 70mm. Target limestone wall 9.5 feet parallel to the sensor plane. Remote release employed. No mirror lockup. Center and all four corners were evaluated to my naked eye on a monitor using 100% crops. Both lenses were new copies received within the last 7 days.\n\nThe limestone wall lent itself perfectly to evaluating sharpness and subtle contrast and color rendition. There was enormous detail present in the wall with subtle colorations present.\n\nFindings:\n\n28MM F8: Tamron definitely sharper in the center and corners\n\n28MM F2.8: Tamron definitely sharper in the center and corners\n\n50MM F8: Tamron slightly sharper in the center and very slightly sharper in corners\n\n50MM F2.8: Tamron slightly sharper in center and equal in corners.\n\n70MM F2.8: Canon sharper in center and at corners. Incidentally noted was inability of Tamron to focus as sharply as I was able to achieve with manual focusing.\n\n70MM F8: Tamron sharper in center with Canon slightly sharper in corners.\n\nSome have said that there is less flare with the Canon, but if you use the lens hood that should not be a problem.  I didn't notice excessive flare in my copy.\n\nAdmittedly there is significant copy to copy variation in both the Canon and the Tamron, but my findings convinced me that at 1/4 the price, and with the Tamron weighing 1 pound less than the Canon that the Tamron was the lens for me.  Optically 5/5!!\n\nI cannot recommend this lens highly enough.  It is the first non-Canon lens I have owned and I am thrilled.;Outstanding lens!
103;2.0;5.0;712.0;"I was a fool to have believed that the kit lens(18-55mm f/3.5-5) from the 350D was enough, but I was more than a fool when I thought the ""nifty-fifty""(50mm f/1.8) was the only lens I needed. The kit lens was only a ""so-so"" lens at best. And the nifty-fifty was hard to take pictures when I must be standing at least 5 feet back to capture my subject. The 1.8 of the nifty-fifty was brilliant but having almost everything except one small spot in focus is not worth my ""Kodak moments."" I needed something more versatile, something efficient and cater to the budget photographer like myself.\n\nI scoured the internet for a lens that could be titled as the ""King of the Walk around Lenses."" Many lenses were nominated by photographers across the net. Lenses such as the Canon 17-40 f/4L, the Canon 17-85 IS USM, Sigma 18-50 f/2.8, the Canon 50mm f/1.8(Nifty Fifty), Canon 24-70 f/2.8L, Canon's 28-135mm IS USM, and much more. A good walk around lens must have versatility, which for me meant a decent zoom range. Something that a prime lens like the ""oh so perfect"" 50mm f/1.8 nifty fifty cannot satisfy.\n\nHere I shall digress a little and talk about the nifty fifty. It's definitely a great lens, a lens that is extremely affordable, approx 80USD. It is outstanding in low light and again, it is CHEAP. Many people love this lens for its value per price, myself included. That is why that the 50mm f/1.8 was my very first lens besides the kit lens. I began using it all the time but always found myself stepping back, way back, in order to achieve a good composition of the subject at hand. This annoyed me a little and I decided to continue my search for the best walk around lens.\n\nBack on topic now, versatility is important, zoom range is important. Something like the 17-85 IS USM, 28-135mm IS USM definitely interested me. These are definitely not as expensive as the other lenses out there, especially the L-line. I was holding back because the prices on the mentioned Canon lenses were still quite steep; they were as expensive as the camera body! I could not come to grip with a lens that costs as much as the body, here I would like to mention I'm new to SLR photography. Price was a major factor for me and the zoom range was important as well.\n\nAlong with zoom range, another aspect of versatility included the lens' ability to be useful for indoor or night photography. This is the reason why I bought the nifty fifty in the first place. I took more interest in the lenses that had a larger aperture; something about f/2.8 just screams sexiness to me. Well with these criteria in mind, I started to really look at the Canon 24-70 f/2.8L. This lens has received epic reviews from every photographer. Its built quality and its pictures are perplexingly amazing. My versatility requirement has been met at every angle. When I look at the price, my jaws dropped and suddenly this lens just became a lens beyond my reach.\n\nAs price is a huge factor in buying anything these days, the price of the Canon 24-70 f/2.8L scared me away. But through my meticulously investigation into the 24-70L lens, I came across a small group of people who had found an alternative.\n\nThat alternative is what I am really reviewing here: the Tamron 28-75 f/2.8.\n\nAdvantages of this lens are the best part. This lens is incredibly versatile, good zoom range, great for low lighting shots. It was the perfect alternative to the beloved Canon 24-70L. The major factor that really pushed me into buying this Tamron was the price. It was a HUGE bargain. The Canon sells for more than a thousand dollars while this Tamron is in the very reachable range of 350USD.\n\nNow there are only a few sample images by fellow amazonites so I was hesitant in believing what others were saying about the quality of the pictures. And there weren't many in depth review on this lens either. I also heard this lens has to seek focus for an image in low lighting areas. I took the plunge and bought this lens anyways.\n\nTo my surprise, this lens is tremendously useful. The 28mm is decent enough for landscape. The other end at 75mm is quite good for portraits or just typical zoom images. My pictures were very sharp comparing to the kit lens and the nifty fifty. I have taken pictures indoor during a cloudy morning, indoor night time with halogen lights in the room, outdoor nature, and outdoor people. This lens produces exceedingly sharp pictures.\n\nThe constant f/2.8 was the best part. I can shoot rather well in low light. For some ridiculous reason, I walked into a national park as the sun was setting, so when I was a mile in, it was already dark. My Tamron was able to still take pictures at ISO speeds of 800 and I thought, ""Wow, I couldn't do this with my other lenses."" With that said, there is one minor annoyance. This is not a USM obviously, so it does take a little bit of time searching for that focus. In extreme low lighting, like that of a hike after the sun has set, it was impossible for me to obtain autofocus. I guess this is true for all lenses so it is not that big of a problem here.\n\nThe Tamron's build quality is quite sturdy. This lens was very strong from when I was playing with it. The 28-75mm is much heavier than the kit lens I received with the 350D so I was still getting used to it. When this lens sits in my 350D body, I couldn't really hold the camera if my hands were only on the camera. I needed to place my left hand on the barrel of the lens in order for a good feel. Mounting this combination onto a light weight tripod gave me moments of fear. The top of the tripod would start tipping forward. When I tilted my camera vertically on the tripod, the tripod tipped to the left. Of course adding weights to the tripod solved the problem but be warned that this is a real lens that has a good weight to it.\n\nComparing to the Canon 24-70L lens, which weighs twice as much and cost three times as much, this Tamron is a steal! Even though this lens is not that well known, I love its ability to compete with the 24-70L. I especially love the price of this incredible lens. For those that are hesitant to buy this lens, please don't be. It's an excellent lens with good quality.\n\nTo sum it all up, the price, the zoom range, the large aperture, the built quality, and again the price make this lens the best ""bang for the buck"" lens for a Canon SLR. I love the ability to just take photos in any situation while producing sharp pictures. This lens claims the title ""King of the Walk Around Lenses"" in my book. And last but not least, a good walk around lens will definitely encounter battle scars so the low cost of this lens would not take a week's worth of pay to buy another one. Two thumbs up, five stars, top 10 rating from me.\n\nI am sorry if this review was too long, I just love this lens.\n\nUpdate(2006-07-12):\nJust came back from a 40 day backpacking trip through Europe. I brought this lens with me along with Canon 50mm f/1.8. The whole time, I only used the Tamron. It was heavy to be strapping the 350D around my neck walking around in 85F heat but i managed.\n\nThe lens performed commendably! It was truly a great walk around lens because when you're out, you're going to be out all day. So from morning to night, my lens was able to capture every moment I wanted to remember. Though I did find myself saying ""I wish I had a wide angle lens"" almost everytime I visited a museum or a church, I still recommend this Tamron whole heartedly.\n\nAfter my long trip, I have learned that no single lens can truly claim to be everything you need, but with this Tamron, you'd have a blast with its sharp pictures! When I was in museums and churches, people were flashing about with their cameras while I took all my photos with my amazing 2.8 aperture so no flash was neccessary, capturing the true lighting on the subjects. People were just amazed and asked ""Wow, you don't need a flash?""\n\nHope I can update every one out there with my experience on the Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8\n\nUpdate 12/13/07: 1 year later......\nThe lens is great, I did a lot of portrait shots over the year and with the 2.8, it made the subject stand out from the background. But I guess I'm still a beginner at photography. I looked back at some photos and realized my portrait style cannot be applied to taking photos of objects. Extending the focal range, I had tried to capture a car from a distance but my shaky hands and the f/2.8 made everything blurry! I have to review my basics and use a smaller aperture.\nStill a great lens, for its price, it's definitely unbeatable.\n\nI have now added a Canon 10-22mm to my collection, which is extremely fun to play with.\n\nUPDATE 4/28/2010: 4 years later!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nOMG can you believe I'm updating this review 4 years later? Well it's because I LOVE this lens!!!!! I've shot a lot in the past 4 years with this lens, and I've grown into loving portrait photography even more. This lens is AMAZING performing portraits, great depth of field with the 2.8 at 75mm. I usually turn up the f-stop to 3.5 or so, 75mm, lower EV -1, and shoot in raw so I can edit the brighten up the photo later on in photoshop. The lens is still very sturdy, I've traveled to Ecuador, Hong Kong, South Korea, and throughout the US since then.\n\nThis lens was so cheap back then, now it's about $440.. wow... what happened?!";Looking for a Good Walk Around Lens? Look no further
9;3.0;5.0;11.0;"I bought this lens used as a backup lens or for a second shooter for use on a full frame Canon (5D mkiii & mkiv).  It represents an incredible value, especially used, I bet I could use it for a few years and sell it a loss of less than a Benjamin.  But beyond being inexpensive it's a sharp lens!  I'm not sure why this doesn't pop up all over youtube when you search for a good starter lens, it's relatively obscure.  Don't just take my word for it, check DXO Mark's web site for a rating, compared to Canon it's superior in several aspect, not all of them, but it's also 500-800% less expensive.  If you're looking for your first sharp lens with shallow depth of field I'd recommend this over the nifty fifty or 85 f/1.8 - if you could only afford one lens, ditch the kit lens, book a model and go shoot with this lens, you will love the results.\nPros:\nObviously price\nFlaws are easily correctible in Light Room\nf2.8 is useable and close to the actual transmittance (it's a fast lens)\nLow Chroma\nBeautiful out of focus area\nVery light weight\nMild macro capabilities\nCons:\nAutofocus is slower than the comparable Canon and it hunts just a little but a 1/2 second of patience isrequired for the best shots.  Focus on breath control & brace just a little while it finds the exact focus\nAppearance of the build quality but if you like the low weight, it's probably a function of that\nLooks inexpensive & perhaps dated - for paid gigs I'd keep this in the bag for a backup or until you've showed off a lens with a red ring\nAutofocus mode is not full time override, you have to flick the manual focus switch to manually set focus.  I'm only mentioning this because this seems to be a point most reviewers will point out about a lens but there is a plus side of this - once you find focus, if you use back button focus, the lens elements are locked down and will not creep - great for astral photography when you've got the camera aimed up high.\n\nAs an aside, there is obvious vignetting below f/4 which could be a problem for landscapes but if you're using Light Room, the program has the Tamron 28-75 corrections programmed in, just check the box and it will be corrected.  For portraits I can see myself shooting wide open and adding a little extra vignetting in post so this is a non issue for my style.\n\nTo help with the look and also lens flare (which appears well controlled in my anecdotal home test) amazon sells an OEM Tamron lens hood.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0010CDWIY/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_dp_T1_vEiozbW0EYWY1\n\nI've attached two photos, the one with the chart in the center was taken at 75mm, about 8 feet away, and at f/2.8.  It should give you an idea of the depth of field. You can see the photos on the wall, about 20"" away are nice and softly out of focus.  You can also see the vignetting at f/2.8 since I didn't correct for it.  I also didn't correct for chroma.  The second photo is real life - one of my dogs.  She was moving around but even with the slow focus I was able to lock in - I added a little extra vignette and processed contrast and colors to taste in light room with only the remove chroma option selected.";STOP, don't buy new.  Used value meter pegged...
89;4.0;5.0;272.0;"Let me start by saying I didn't want to like this lens. I've been a Canon lens purist since my first camera. I've always considered second party lenses to be inferior and not worth my time. Recently, however, I acquired another body (EOS 1). I wanted a dedicated walk around lens for it, since I'd been alternating my 24-70L between my digital and this new body. Unfortunately, my funds are a bit limited at them moment, so I wasn't able to purchase another 24-70L as I would have liked. So I began an extensive search for a lens that would fit my needs AND budget.\n\nAfter a while, I started leaning toward the 28-105 f/3.5-4.5. However, although I got close to purchasing one several times, I just couldn't pull the trigger. It seemed good enough, but I just wasn't convinced. Then just by accident, I read a review of the Tamron. The review went on and on about the performance and sharpness of the lens. I thought it was all just hot air. Then I saw a second review that stated the same thing. I became intrigued. I started my research. I went to several different sources and a clear picture began to emerge: this is a lens that a lot of people really like. This is a lens that consistently gets compared to my beloved 24-70L, and consistently holds its own--or even out performs it. At first I thought it unfair to compare it to the 24-70L, but then I saw sample images. I saw sharpness tests. I was impressed.\n\nSo I took the plunge, and I'm so glad I did. As soon as it arrived, the first thing I noticed was that it did not feel like a cheap lens. I had expected it to be feather-light and almost flimsy. Instead, it feel substantial. It also came with a lens hood.\n\nI threw it on my 400D and fired off some shots and took a look. I was very happy with the results. The color reproduction was great. And so was the sharpness. Just for my own edification, I set up my tripod and made some test shots with the Tamron and then the same shots with the 24-70L. The first go 'round was done at f/5.6. I made exposures at 28mm, 35mm, 50mm, and 70mm with each camera. I had a friend rename the files so I wouldn't know which shots came from which camera, so I couldn't claim bias either way. I then examined the shots. It didn't take nit-picky scrutiny to see the differences. After I selected the photos I found to be sharper in each group, my friend gave me the exif data on each one.\n\nHere is what I found:\n\nFirst Impression--At 25% magnification on my screen, all the photos looked fantastic. This puzzled me because I figured I'd be able to spot the 24-70L right away. I really couldn't tell the difference.\n\nThen I zoomed in to 100% and the fun really began.\n\n28mm--The difference in sharpness was very pronounced at this focal length. One photo was the clear winner, and that was the Tamron, particularly in center sharpness.\n\n35mm--Again, one of the photos was a clear winner, and again it was the Tamron.\n\n50mm--For the third time, the Tamron's sharpness outperformed the Canon. I was beginning to really develop an affinity for this little baby.\n\n70mm--At this length, the photos were pretty comparable. I picked one, however, and, to my surprise, it was the Tamron once again.\n\n-----\n\nAfter these tests I felt like a heretic. I had preferred the Tamron lens over the Canon in each trial. Granted, there are more I need to do, from wide open to fully stopped down. But this initial test has made me very happy.\n\nI have seen no evidence of CA so far, and given Tamron's claims, I would have been surprised if I had.\n\nThe AF is a touch on the loud side (no USM), but it works well and is accurate. A bit of noise from the AF is nothing to complain about when one sees the results in the photos.\n\nIt's not weather sealed like the 24-70L, but that is not as important to me as to someone who is out in extreme weather with some regularity.\n\nFinally, given the fact that this lens is just a third of the price of the 24-70L, and given that I am so impressed with the results, I'd have to say this is one of the better purchases I've made in a long, long time.\n\nI know all Tamron lenses do not perform this admirably, just like all Canons are not ""L"" class. However, I will certainly add them to my research when I have a new need for a lens.";An Unbelievable Value
47;5.0;1.0;170.0;"*******PLEASE READ UPDATES AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS REVIEW TO LEARN WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH MY LENS AT TAMRON***********\n\nI bought this lens after reading so many positive reviews from Amazon customers.  However, I did note on a multitude of websites such as slrgear.com, dpreview, and photozone.de that these lenses have quality control issues.  These websites all had to use multiple lenses from Tamron before receiving one that worked good enough to test.  When the lenses work, they are great.  Unfortunately, I RECEIVED 3 BAD COPIES!!!\n\nLens 1\n------\nThis lens, though tac sharp, was completely unacceptable.  Randomly, with all camera settings the same, the aperture would get stuck and overexpose pictures to the point of a white out.  When this happens, I would have to zoom in or out and return to the same position, then the lens would work again.  Then, after 20 more shots, the over exposure would occur again.  Needless to say, I returned it.\n\nLens 2\n------\nThis lens blurred randomly through out different points in the zoom range.  I tested it side by side with Lens 1 and Lens 3, the blur was outrageous and f2.8 to f5.6 was incredibly poor.\n\nLens 3\n------\nThis is the lens that (unfortunately) I decided to keep.  This lens has the least amount of issues.  Unfortunately, I did not notice its problem until too late, particularly because the error with the lens is not readily noticeable and I suspect the way it behaves is probably the same that so many customers have not yet noted and are not examining their pix close enough to see this behavior.  The behavior/issue is this...\n\nLens 3 between 28mm and 45mm focal lengths has a left side blur at the lower left quadrant of the pix.  It is most noticeable in peculiar and very particular settings.\n\nSetting 1 - shooting less than infinity focus at a 45 degree angle downward at a target low to the ground (example, my cat on the floor).  I am holding the camera standing up, aimed down at 45 degrees.  The cat is center.  Take the shot, review, and the carpet is completely blurred on the left side.  Stopping down to f8 helps, but it is still very bad up to 5.6 stops.  Who expects to shoot at f8 indoors at close distances any way???  You should be able to shoot at f4 minimum, let alone f2.8.\n\nSetting 2 - same 45 degree angle shooting scenario, this time outdoors in a landscape shot of flowers focus less than infinity.  The grass, just like the carpet, is a complete blur on the left lower quadrant. Shot at f4 to f8, blur still persists at any setting, just a little better at f8.  Then again, I should easily be able to shoot at 4 stops, instead of stopping down to 8 stops.\n\nSetting 3 - This is the most critical for the issue really becomes very evident when shooting at infinity focus from 28-45mm at 2.8 to f8 stops.  I shot a row of trees straight on at f5.6 to f8 (and just to test, I stopped down to f10 to f16 which did not make a difference).  The trees were blurred on the left, and more so, the grass was completely blurred into a green slur.  This happens every time.\n\nSetting 4 - shooting low to the ground (about 2 to 3 feet off the ground) aimed down range about 15 feet or more.  Again, grass on the right of the pix is clear and sharp, left side is a total mess.\n\nNow, with extreme inconvenience, I have to mail in my lens on whim of hope that the blur can be fixed, though so many have complained Tamron was not able to fix their blur issues.  I have had the lens for a little over a month, and now I am stuck.  All I have to say is this:  If my lens does not come back fixed I will NEVER, EVER give Tamron another dime or even a thought of their products in the future.  It is completely unacceptable to have purchased 3 of the same product and have 3 outright defects where all the lenses behaved differently.  This lens is just glass, no special features are packed into this lens (like image stabilization or an internal IF motor). At 450 bucks, their is no excuse for this poor quality.  I might have paid only 300 bucks and still not be satisfied with this lens, especially after going through such a long drawn out process of having to test 3 lenses, and ship 3 lenses, and type this review with no 28-75 lens to be found in my house for they are returned or sitting in the repair shop!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nTamron has no quality consistency at all, and I would advise anyone who has a Tamron lens to double check their pics by doing infinity focus tests..basically, take a picture of a tree sitting by itself in the yeard 25 feet out, aiming the camera in a 45 degree downward angle and at the trunk right where the trunk meets the ground and another shot at the tree straight on. Then observe grass in the photos.  This is the best way to do a ""real world"" test, not a flat chart test, to see if the lens is acting appropriately. Keep in mind, portraits, pet photography, and action photography are not going to show corner softness or de-centered sharpness for the very center of the picture (human face, the pet's face, etc) is the only thing in the plane of focus.  Architectural and landscape photography are what demands corner to corner sharpness and I have a hunch people are not using this lens for such, thus so many good ratings.  I do see this lens as being a good portrait lens and that seems to be the primary (only) use for this lens by so many using it that are ALSO into extreme photography.  This lens just does not yield good results in any other condition.\n\nAlso, as quoted from Photozone.de regarding test results of the Tamron 28-75 (a professional photography equipment test website): '...it should be mentioned that this is the 2nd tested sample of this lens and both showed centering defects - this is worrisome. The build quality of the lens is decent but nothing to rave about. If you can live with the rather odd zoom range within the APS-C scope the lens is worth a deeper look - assuming you can get a good sample.'\n\nOther websites had the same findings concerning quality control.  On a positive note, they all had the same findings when it came to a good copy of the 28-75 lens - tac sharp results at f4 stops through the entire focal range, if not at f4 stops, then at f5-f5.6 stops.  Overall, you have to roll the dice, or be patient and send your new lens in for repair or replacement once you get it.  This is NOT how to run a business, but it seems to be the market standard for photography equipment. Canon and Nikon (and sometimes Pentax) users all have the same complaint.  PATHETIC!\n\nOTHER POOR QUALITIES-BASED ON ALL 3 LENSES USED\n-----------------------------------------------\n1- This lens colors photos with about +15% amber.  I have to tweak my white balance on my Pentax K-R to get the proper color (with a Pentax K-R, +4Blue, +1 Green).  I actually used a 4th Tamron 28-75 on a Canon T2i, the results for poor color were worse, on top of this, the T2i did not have but one customizable white balance setting where the K-R can be changed on every preset (just one reason I chose the K-R over the T2i, though the T2i is a good camera - I am not reviewing cameras here and do not want to disrespect Canon or Canon users).\n2- Poor manual focus ring - it has extremely short travel making it very touchy to manually adjust focus - barely touching it quickly puts you out of focus again\n3- Often miss focuses\n4- Not a 2.8 lens.  Count on f4 stops maybe, if not, 5.6.  However, 2.8 stops can be used to add nice soft focus effects, so it has its advantages - but this is not per specs and not using the lens as intended.\n5- Lens glass is very sticky and attracts particles.  My Pentax lenses are smooth thus clean easily and do not attract dust like this Tamron\n\nNOTE:\nAs entry level as my Pentax K-R kit 18-55 DA L lens is, it performs nearly as well as this Tamron lens in some, not all, settings.  Since having problems with the Tamron, I acquired a Pentax 18-55 AL II which improves on the sharpness of the 18-55 kit lens and the color and contrast is much better.  To this point, the AL II has proven better than the Tamron and has a more useful zoom range allowing more wide angle shots while also allowing for better focusing, a quick shift focus ring so using the AF/MF button is not necessary, and the focus ring has longer travel that is far smoother and more accurate than the Tamron 28-75.  Additionally, my Pentax 55-300mm, while not RATED as sharp as the 28-75, easily outperforms the Tamron as far as consistent sharpness and focus accuracy, and from 70 to 270mm little difference in sharpness can be made compared to the Tamron at its best settings.  The Tamron 28-75mm is RATED sharper at any given stop, but I can almost not see a difference.  Honestly, I would rather have a consistent performer than have a lens I cannot use at all from 28-45mm when advertised to be 28-75mm unless I want to intentionally blur pix all the time!!!  I did not buy a 45mm-75mm lens, I bought a 28-75mm lens and expect it to work as such.  Not a big expectation for 450 bucks!!!\n\nI gotta say, buying a camera lens is the hardest thing I have had to do in my 3 decades of shopping - quality control and poor performance really plagues this market.  It is not limited to Tamron, though I am extremely disappointed with them.  All I can say is I hope you have better experiences than so many of us who have not!!!\n\n***UPDATE 12-20-2011***\nConcerning my 3rd Tamron lens for Pentax which I chose to keep, as you recall in my review above, I had a lower left quadrant blur in pix taken at 28-45mm focal lengths.  I sent my lens in for repair on the 32nd day of ownership the first week of November in which I was told policy is that first time for repair customers must pay shipping - so I did.  I was told there was a 5 day turn around, and I did receive the lens back timely, but WITHOUT REPAIR.  I called Tamron immediately and resent photos showing the blur.  Rep 1 dodged my calls and emails for a week.  I called again, getting Rep 1 again, I refused to speak to him since he has been dodging me, and asked for another Rep which I then proceeded to deal with.  I sent pix to this Rep, Rep 2, and he did immediately confirm there is something wrong with the lens based on the pics I sent in.  I was sent a shipping label and told to return the lens, and told they will definitely be able to repair it this time and that there is a 5 day turn around.  So, I shipped the lens on December 8.  On December 14, I receive an email that they got the lens, but UPS confirmed its delivery on December 12.  Okay, I will deal with the lag, maybe Tamron is busy.  So, another week goes by, the lens has been there for 7 business days, I call and nobody from Customer Service at Tamron has contacted me to this point and nobody knows the status of my lens, just that they have received it.  I then demand a call back from a manager.  So, rapidly, a manager did contact me...now the bomb....the Lens as of December 15 has been sent to JAPAN!!!  I was informed I will not see it for more than 2 weeks - now I don't have my lens I bought 2 months ago for Christmas.  The only reason why I kept this lens was due to the fact that within the Amazon returns window of 30 days, the first 30 days I had the lens, I contacted Tamron to tell them I had a 3rd defective lens and they said they can just calibrate the lens if I chose to keep it.  Keep in mind, the only reason I went this route was because I already purchased 2 outright faulty lenses and so many people have said this is a great lens so I wanted to give Tamron a chance.  WOW, what a HUGE mistake.  I was never told I would have to pay for shipping for calibration of a new lens which should be working to begin with - I guess I should never have assumed otherwise.  Also, I was told prior to deciding to keep the lens that the repair facility is in New York (NOT Japan) and turn around times are 5 days.  Another LIE.\n\nI explained my situation kindly to the manager I spoke with and requested I at least get a refund for the shipping costs of $15 for the first time I had to send the lens in.  This manager upheld all remarks I have heard back from Customer Service Reps to this point, ""we at Tamron do not pay for your initial shipping to have a lens repaired - the customer has to pay the first time""  Okay, so, the lens is brand new, it should not have been faulty to begin with, but it is the customer's responsibility???  WOW. And now they see they are at fault, but will not refund $15.  SO, I demanded a full refund of the lens for it is brand new, it is out of the country for which they have chosen to do after lying to me the repair facility is in New York, they possess all the paper work, the box, the lens and it is out of my hands - I told them I don't want it back.  I was told they do occasionally refund entirely in this situation.  WOW AGAIN.  They would rather refund me $460.00 for this lens than just $15 for my initial shipping to have this lens fixed that should have been functioning to begin with.  You think they would give a 10 percent discount on future purchases, refund a portion of the amount paid for this lens, offer a new lens, do SOMETHING to promote their product and take care of the customer while making them feel good about a product that was purchased from them....NOT so...they just take the lens away from you and propose to give a refund.  Amazing, to say the least.\n\nI kept this lens past the 30 day return window at Amazon in good faith that this is a good lens according to reviewers.  I kept this lens in good faith that Tamron would stand behind their recommendations that I should keep the lens and that they could just calibrate it to fix it to the condition the lens should have been in to begin with, and within 5 days.  You think they would promote their product by returning it to new condition within a reasonable time frame and fix it at the location they said their repair facility exists.  You think maybe they would replace the defective lens with a new one.  NOPE!  Wait for MONTHS, get a run around, or just don't use Tamron products...\n\n***UPDATE 2/6/2012***\nTamron did in fact conclude the lens was not reparable and refunded me in full for the amount I paid for the lens from Amazon.  As difficult as this has all been, it is very credible to them since they backed up their warranty/quality guarantee.  This does make me feel more trusting towards them for possible future considerations of their products, though at this point, I will still not buy from them.  Shockingly, it has been 5 months to the day since my fiasco with the 28-75 lenses began!!!";SERIOUS QUALITY CONTROL ISSUES
80;6.0;4.0;89.0;"It's been about 2 months that I've had this lens and it almost never leaves my camera.  I'm came to buying this lens after being lured in by the ever-so-attractive constant f/2.8 aperture.  It was a contest between this lens and the Nikon 16-85 f/3.5-5.6 VR and now, I know I've made the right choice.\n\nFirst and foremost, the constant f/2.8 is what makes this lens worth every penny.  I don't know how I ever got along with my old 18-55 kit lens.  Here's a little breakdown of the good and bad of this lens:\n\nTHE GOOD:\n- Constant f/2.8 aperture (*angelic singing*)\n- Extremely sharp even wide open at f/2.8 (although I'd recommend f/4 for maximum sharpness)\n- Zoomed in at 75mm and wide open at f/2.8, this lens makes beautiful portraits with nice bokeh.\n- On a purely subjective scale, bokeh is pretty awesome, 8 out of 10.\n- Focusing is relatively fast and very accurate (about as fast as the 18-55mm kit lens, which is almost always good enough)\n- Zoom action is well damped although I would've appreciated a very slightly shorter throw between 28 and 75mm.\n- Autofocus/Manual focus switch conveniently located on the side of the lens.\n- Internal autofocus motor! (Works on my D40x, will work on D40 and D60 also)\n- Close focus ability enables shots with a closer perspective.\n- Metal mount is always a good thing to see.\n- Looks pretty awesome on the camera :)\n\nTHE BAD\n- For travel and other things, 28mm will not satisfy some, buy a wide angle (and telephoto if you need it) to go with this lens.\n- External focus ring moves during autofocusing (keep your hands away!)\n- Focusing is noisy (much noisier than my AF-S Nikkors and HSM Sigmas)\n- In manual focus-mode, the focus ring is a tad loose\n- Lens hood doesn't seem to work too well, doens't look that great either, in my opinion.\n- Rear lens cap sucks, throw it away and buy a Nikon one.\n\nOVERALL\nI'd rate this thing 4.5 stars if I could, but I gave it 4 so as not to give the impression of a fault-less lens.\n\nThis lens has a great deal of good points and very few bad ones.  Most of the bad I attribute to the construction of the lens: somewhat solid, but not.  It's a little loose inside since it zooms and is made mostly of plastic.  Optically though, the lens is amazing, especially for the price.  For me, it's created amazing portrait work, some cool close-up (see the ""PS"" section at the end) shots, and many others.  Until you build up the money and arm strength to buy and haul around the Nikon 24-70 f/2.8 go with this lens.  You cannot pass this up for the price, it's capable of so many things, and all for about 400 bucks.\n\nPS\nTamron may call this ""Macro"" but it's not really macro, it's more of a close focus (I have the Nikkor 60mm Micro, and this is not it).  However, the close-focus can be really useful and can add some creative shots to your collection.  However, do not confuse this lens with a real macro lens, it can't focus as close and can't reproduce 1:1.";Perfect walk-around lens, my new favorite
105;7.0;5.0;84.0;I am someone who swears by Canon and would not buy any other lens.  Tamron has made me swallow my pride with this lens, I have to admit this is one gorgeous piece of glass, especially for the price and the 2.8 aperture.  Comes with a hood, body kinda feels a little cheap, but to me, all that matters is the quality of the pictures and I am completely satisfied, thoroughly impressed with the quality of the photos.\n\nVery sharp images at 2.8, through out the zoom range.  I even took a portrait with this lens at 65-70mm 1/250 @ 2.8, ISO 400 with my EOS 3 (35mm)...one of the best portraits I've taken.  Incidentally, this is the first photograph I clicked with this lens and I have to admit that I am floored.  Honestly, I am toying with the idea of buying one more for my 20D.\n\nGorgeous background blur, which is one of the factors that impressed me the most and the DoF is good enough to focus the subject completely.  I like to focus on the subject's eye and have enough DoF to cover the entire body (depth) of the subject rather than blurring out any part of the body.  This lens serves the purpose and would give the portrait a really professional feel.\n\nThe other factor that impressed me is the minimum focusing distance - I took some macro shots in a tide pool in Point Loma / San Diego and I am thoroughly impressed with the sharpness @ 2.8 as well as the distance.  I think I went as close as 7-8 inches ( did not measure, as seen by my friend) and was happy with that too.\n\nIn short, if you are toying with the idea of buying the 24-70 2.8L (which was the case with me) and want to leave that for an upgrade, you won't regret buying this lens.  I think I will wait for the Canon 1-2-3 rebate for the 24-70 2.8 and will still keep this lens as a part of my kit.\n\n5 stars, must buy!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nUPDATE ON 17 MAR 2007\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nDecided to go for an upgrade to Canon 24-70 f/2.8L and conducted amateurish tests side by side at various focal lengths and apertures, all else being the same.  Ended up returning the Canon and decided to keep the Tamron.  The Canon was certainly a good copy, tacccckkkk sharp, but couldn't beat the sharpness out of the Tamron.  The Tamron came out much sharper across wide open apertures (centers & edges, as examined by the naked eye at 100% image size) and equal sharpness between the two lenses at f/8 and above.  Stunning image quality in both, the Canon locked the exposure much more consistently than the Tamron (which moved a half a stop or so while trying to focus).  The only two areas where Canon beat Tamron was\n(1) Canon focussed silently and much more smoothly compared to the Tamron\n(2) Build quality, Canon is really built like a tank, cant think of any other word.  Tamron feels cheap and plasticky when compared to the Canon.\n\nFinally, I didn't feel like I was getting much value for $800 more, as my Tamron was already giving superior, TACK sharp image quality.  However, for 1/3rd the price, 1/3rd the weight, I decided it was too pricy and upgrade and returned the Canon.  Go Tamron!\n\n-----------------------------------\nUpdate on 23 Nov 2007\n-----------------------------------\nAlmost 2 years with this lens, couldn't be more satisfied.  this lens has never failed me during multiple trips in extreme conditions of heat, cold and extreme (S California wild fire) winds.  No dust or other issues.\nI did notice that images were soft after f/16 due to diffraction, but I do not think that is the lens' fault.  Images at f/22 and f/32 are very soft and unacceptable for professional prints or enlargements above 8x10 when shot at 8MP (20D), but that was more my fidgeting to see what happens at those apertures.  I almost never use anything narrower than f/13, so it doesnt concern me.  Overall, very satisfied with this purchase, this one is a keeper even if I buy the 24-105L or 24-70L.;Excellent lens - might buy one more for myself
22;8.0;5.0;37.0;"First of all, this lens is fantastic. There are a few reasons why, and I will go over them, but if you are looking for a great walk around lens that is nice and fast, look no further. This lens is heavy, built well, and produces wonderful images.\n\nVisit Tamron's site to download the lens guide PDF: http://www.tamron-usa.com/lenses/prod/2875mm.asp#ad-image-0\n\nLet's get down to brass tacks, the pros and cons of this lens. I will tell you why I like this lens and how I use it.\n\nI am a working photographer. I earn a living shooting weddings and events in Hampton Roads, Virginia. This lens helps me earn money because it produces great results in a wide range of applications. To be truthful, I push the limits of both my camera and the lighting situations I find myself in and would consider my knowledge at an expert level.\n\nFirst there must be a basis for comparison. Lenses are not created equal, and the price of a lens is volatile, that is to say that once a professional level of optics are attained, very small advances in performance can come at a very high cost.\nTherefore, I consider the Category, Sensor Size the lens is designed to work with, Distortion, Chromatic Aberration, Aperture, and Price, in that order.\n\nCATEGORY: Constant f2.8 28-75 Full Frame Lens.\nThis Lens is competing with other Lenses with constant aperture at f2.8 with a focal length between 16-75. Tamron\nDoes offer a weather sealed version of this lens for around $1100. It has a pezio drive and is directly competing with the Nikon 17-55mm f/2.8G ED-IF AF-S DX Lens. You can find these two lenses here:\n\nNikon: http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-17-55mm-2-8G-ED-IF-Nikkor/dp/B000144I2Q $1399\nTamron: http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-17-55mm-2-8G-ED-IF-Nikkor/dp/B000144I2Q $1099\n\nSENSOR SIZE:\nNo, the lens does not have a sensor in it, but it is made for a Full Frame camera. You can use this lens on an APSC sensor size, which is good. Some even believe that you will have better results using a FF lens on an APSC sensor because of the crop factor pulling the sharpest part of the lens, the center area, into focus and discarding the edges of the lens.\n\nDISTORTION:\nDistortion, This is a legacy designed lens. This is important because the lens was designed when cameras did not have built in line correction and micro correction. Moreover, this lens was designed when the average consumer did not have access to programs like DxO Optics Pro 9 and Light Room (both of these programs have built in profiles to correct lens distortion on specific camera bodies).\n\nThis is important to you because it was designed when the lens had to be good optically because corrections in post production were very difficult. This lens Hit the market in the  at least 2003.\n\nThis lens has some soft areas wide open at 28mm. They are mainly in the edges of the lens. Center is tack sharp. This is not a bad thing though, remember that an aperture of 2.8 should give a very shallow depth of field, and an extremely narrow focus. Therefore one would expect the edges to be soft. I absolutely love this. DXO optics has tested this lens and approves of it. But don't let someone else's numbers confuse you. All their numbers mean is that it is a great lens for the price. I'm sure that someone will begin comparing this statement to some $4k plus lens, but remember, this lens is not competing in the $4k arena. It does, however, hold up very well.\n\nIn my use I have seen very little to no distortion. I take portraits of individuals and groups, so I would not expect to see a lot of distortion. If I were taking photo of buildings, any distortion the lens has would become more apparent.\n\nCHROMATIC ABERRATION\nSo far I have seen nothing that I would say detracts form the image. The Lens is prone to flaring when pointed toward direct bright light, like a sunset, but what better of an image to get than a silhouette of a bride and groom with a natural lens flair? For me its great, maybe not so much for you.\n\nAPERTURE\nThis is an f2.8, constant throughout the zoom range, right? Yes. but do you know what that means? Are all 2.8's equal? The answer is both yes and no. To make this simple, aperture is nothing more than a mathematical ratio. it actually looks like this f 1:2.8, We just drop the ""1:"" and display it as f2.8.\n\nSo now that you know it's a ratio, what is it competing? It is comparing goal length to the diameter of the aperture, or how big of a whole the aperture has at a known focal length. To find out how big your aperture is in MM just divide the focal length by the current aperture. So a focal length of 100mm at an aperture of 2 would be 100mm/2=50mm. This means that your aperture would be physically open by 50mm at a focal length of 100mm.\n\nThis is important because, as ratios are always comparing aperture diameter to focal length, they should be constant across different lenses. So you could say that a 50mm prime at an f2 has an aperture diameter of 25mm. The example above showed that a lens with a focal length of 100mm at an f2 would be 50mm in diameter. This is correct, but would be costly to build and quite heavy. Instead many lenses have an articulated aperture, which is to say that their maximum aperture changes throughout the zoom range. you will usually see something like an 18-55 f3.5-5.6. That means that on the wide end of the lens the max aperture is 3.5, so 18/3.5=5.14mm and 55/5.6=9.82mm.\n\nThis lens example from above is almost always going to be bad in low light, and would probably be a kit lens. The Tamron Lens that this article is about is a 24-75 f2.8 which means that the max aperture on the wide end is 24/2,8=8.57mm and on the zoom end the aperture diameter is 75/2.8=26.78mm.  Let's compare them:\nCommon 18-55 f3.5-5.8  Max Aperture diameter wide angle: 5.14mm  max aperture zoomed in: 9.82mm\nTamron  24-75 f2.8  Max Aperture diameter wide angle: 8.57mm  max aperture zoomed in: 26.78mm\n\nBigger diameter aperture is better because it gives you more usable light in low light situations, it also gives you more control on depth of field.\n\nPRICE: It's $500. This is a steal for this lens. It works in many situations and gives you the most control over your creativity- considering the alternatives, it is about  or less the price. I have truly enjoyed this lens and you will too. My suggestion is to buy the body of the camera you want- do not buy a bundled lens- and get this lens as your walk around lens.\n\nCheck out samples with this lens and others buy visiting www.

15;9.0;2.0;28.0;"I hardly leave reviews, but considering the crazy amount of great reviews on this product, I figured I should warn potential customers on what this lens is and isn't good for.\n\nI bought this lens primarily for low-light live music venues - my other lenses are all Canon brand prime lenses, with much wider max apertures, but I really wanted a lens with more flexibility in zoom range so I didn't have to carry two camera bodies around at venues to have two different focal lengths. I bought this lens with extremely high hopes and was so excited to test it out, and it simply didn't perform for what I needed.\n\n1. Focus extremely soft at 2.8 - I have no idea if I simply received a soft copy of this lens or I was expecting too much compared to my prime lenses, but shot after shot the focus was just not sharp enough, even in bright daylight.\n\n2. Autofocus ""hunting"" - Autofocus is extremely slow and clunky, especially in low-lighting. Seems to ""hunt"" for the AF point even when I have a single point selected.\n\n3. Zoom. Ring. Is. TERRIBLE - the zoom ring is so hard to turn compared to other zoom lenses I have played around with, and is simply not smooth. The amount of force it takes to turn this thing is ridiculous. You can forget about taking video with this lens because if you want to zoom in or out, you will be struggling so much you won't be able to keep the camera still. The focus ring doesn't seem to have this problem. Again, I'm not sure if it's just my copy of the lens or if all of them have this problem.\n\nI hate to be a ""hater"" and really had high hopes for this lens. I'm sure it would perform fine as a general walk around lens in generous amounts of light, but I prefer primes over zooms for that any day. It definitely beats the pants off of any 18-55 kit lens.  I'm sad to return it because I wanted it to work out so badly. I guess you really do get what you pay for, I'm going to save up for the Canon 24-70 L";Had high hopes, disappointed
10;10.0;5.0;12.0;I, like many others, had autofocus issues with this lens. I was about to send it back. Then, I began reading up on lens calibration and thought I would give it a try. If you have a higher-end camera body (not a Rebel series), you are able to calibrate individual lenses. Mine had a rather severe front-focus. After calibrating the lens, it stopped hunting for a focal point and selected the one I wanted.\n\nThis lens gets some of the sharpest pictures I've taken, and they really have a beautiful shine to them. I have a 7d Mark II body and consider myself a hobbyist, not a professional.;Don't Give Up Too Soon!
13;11.0;5.0;21.0;I just bought this for my Nikon D750 full frame DSLR and I'm coming from using my neighbor's fancy Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8 lens so I was skeptical on how it would measure up to an expensive lens like that. After a day of shooting in the snow with a lot of shots featuring the sun over a snowy field I can say it holds it's own. I did notice a bit of color banding when the sun reflects off the lens from an angle but this is a minor issue that I'm sure a filter will clean up. I put it to work last night capturing an astro-lapse for a couple hours and the image quality is on par with the Nikon lens. I'm amazed at how sharp this lens is. I was thinking I would be down-grading going to a cheaper lens but so far my pictures haven't reflected any loss in quality. I was thinking the lack of vibration control would be an issue but even when it was fully zoomed in I was able to capture shots at 1/30 seconds exposure without using stabilization and this is what I had come to expect from the Nikon lens. All in all it's a great value if you want f/2.8 at 75mm without breaking the bank.;Nice affordable Full-frame lens
2;12.0;5.0;59.0;"I've been shopping for a new lens for quite some time now. I got my 20D a few months ago and I finally settled on this lens. I did my research on this lens. I have heard nothing but good about it. I've only tested the lens for a couple of days now and I am totally amazed with the quality of this lens. And the price is right too. The lens is fast and sharp. The build of this lens is excellent... it fits well in my hand and the weight is not too light [junky] and it's not too heavy... it's perfect for keeping on the camera at all times. The images captured by this lens are just ""wow"". I don't think I could have found a better zoom lens for my 20D. This is the lens that I am going to always leave on my camera. I couldn't suggest a better one.";Just what my 20D needed...
1;13.0;5.0;49.0;Well first of all let me start off by telling you that I purchased this lens from Amazon for my Canon Digital Rebel XT. This was my first dslr and was looking for a replacement solution for the 18-55 kit lens.\n\nI was researching the Canon 28-135 and this the Tamron 28-75. I had  taken a look at both of them in-person at my local camera shop. The build quality of the Canon did seem a bit better but the Tamron by no means is a pig when it comes to quality of craftsmanship. So after taking a look at both of these lenses, I decided on the Tamron and I content with the purchase.\n\nThe good:\n\n1. Nice build quality\n\n2. Not too heavy\n\n3. Has a zoom lock\n\n4. 2.8 throughout focal range although it seems as though mine is not as sharp at 2.8 vs the slower speeds but this is to be expected.\n\n5. Tamron rebate came super quick\n\n6. 6 YEAR warranty\n\n7. Included a petal shaped hood\n\n8. Metal mount\n\n9. Overall nice focal range (would have preferred a bit longer, but this will do just fine for the moment)\n\n10. Amazon had it in stock, free shipping and no tax\n\nThe bad:\n\n1. At 2.8 doesnt seem as sharp as it possibly can, but this can be remedied by sending it to Tamron for calibrating (hey i have 6 years to send it back)\n\n2. Nothing else!\n\nOverall I really enjoy this lens. Ever since I got this lens, I do not use my kit lens at all. Focusing is pretty quick and spot on. Some complain of the lens being loud, but to tell you the truth, its not loud at all but not super silent either. I am happy about this purchase and will continue using this lens as my main walk-around lens. Perhaps later, I will send it back to Tamron for calibration, but overall is a really nice lens at a even better price.\n\nHope this helps.;Wow what a lens!
84;14.0;5.0;37.0;I purchased this lens to use for the majority of my shooting on my D300.  I have one of the latest copies with the built-in motor.  I'm amazed at its focusing capabilities with the D300 - fast and quiet. Images are sharp as a tack and the blurred background is perfect at 2.8. You can easily see the three LD glass elements at work!\n\nI enjoy this range (28-75) for everyday shooting and portraits. Also, the macro capabilities of this lens makes it a fun one to keep on the camera. I sold a more expensive new Tokina lens and this thing blows it away in sharpness and color contrast. I was a little curious of Tamron's build quality, but this SP lens is very good quality, especially for the money. Low light and indoor photos on the D300 have been great with this lens!\n\nI can't say enough about this lens. You get a lot for the small price of this lens...buy it, if this is the range your looking for. It fits perfect in the gap of my other lenses: Sigma 10-20 & Nikon 70-300VR. GREAT GLASS!!;Incredible Lens! Great with D300! One of my favorites!
5;15.0;5.0;42.0;"Got my Digital Rebel XT (350D) about a week and a half ago and was deciding between this Tamron (28-75 f/2.8), the Canon 24-85, and the canon 28-135IS, and for my money, this became the hands down choice.  I researched this decision for a good month and a half (the digital rebel XT was not yet released in the US so i had some time to decide) and my goal was to buy a lens to start out the XT with that was able to bring out the true power of the new 8MP XT.  The lens is faster and better quality than the Canon 24-85, and although it isn't as long-range as the Canon 28-135IS, it is smaller, lighter, cheaper, and ""feels better"" on the rebel than the 28-135 for everyday use.\n\nIf you are looking for a solid lens to cover most of your subjects (from telephoto to portraits to some strikingly sharp up-close Macro shots), and be able to leave it on the camera without much hassle, this is the lens for you.  As far as image quality goes, this lens is comparable to the much much pricier Canon 24-70L series, and furthermore, it is smaller and lighter than the L-Series.\n\nI was skeptical at first about buying any third party lens, and i still am, but this specific lens speaks for itself.  The lens speed was the final straw in my decision... at f/2.8 this lens is quite a bit faster than the Canon 24-85 (f/3.5-4.5); and it comes with the Tamron 6-Year warranty.  I bought this lens for $399 and it was worth every penny.\n\nIf you are looking in the long range for setting yourself up with a multi-lens system, this lens fits quite well without much overlap with other high quality lens.  I plan on getting a Canon 50mm (f/1.4) for fast portraits, a Canon 50mm Macro for super close shots, and the Canon 70-200L for longer range shots to round out my ability to shoot a variety of subjects.  The only overlap with the Tamron 28-75 is the 70-75 range which is nonconsequential to me.  Hope this was helpful.";Great Leave-On-The-Camera Lens for D-RebelXT!
61;16.0;4.0;29.0;"Hey guys,\n  Well i am a beginning, self taught, photographer. I am currently going to college so that means i CANNOT spend $2000 for an amazing nikon 24-70 or 70-200 vr II. I was in this situation. It is easy for someone with $2000 to spend or a professional photographer to say oh just get the nikon 24-70. I do agree with them that the nikon 24-70 etc. is going to be better, but for your money you get the best value with the tamron 28-75. For $500 this is a great deal. I have had this lens for about six months now and taken around 1000 pictures with it. Here are some pros and cons.\n\nPros\n.Only $500\n.large constant f2.8 aperture\n.great picture quality\n.works on full frame camera\n.lock mode on camera to prevent lens creep(this only works in the lowest focal length setting)\n.comes with petal hood to prevent lens flare\n.internal auto focus, it is the nikon af-s equivalent and CAN autofocus on d40's and d60's\n.light and small size\n.67mm diameter=cheaper filters buying a 67mm and 77mm have a big difference in price especially for top quality brands like b and w\n.good feel to the manual focus ring\n\nCons\n.zoom isn't smooth throughout the whole zoom range, slightly sticky at the lower end\n.okay build quality\n.third party brand(i'll talk more about this later)\n.some odd flaring situations\n.okay auto focus(much better than non on a d60)\n.awkward zoom range, not wide enough for a good landscape(plus the 1.5x crop factor on my d60 which comes out to the lowest of 42mm)\n\n  I love how tamron put an internal focus motor in the tamron 28-75. This is a life saver. Of course there are times in low light situations or doing macro work when this does not apply; but in everyday shooting this comes in handy. I would love to purchase a d90--it has a built in auto focus motor--but then again it's $750 new. I would much rather buy a tripod or adobe lightroom than another body.\n\n  As a beginning photographer one might not realize the benefit of having a CONSTANT f2.8. It does not change during the zoom range. This is great for shotting in the gymnasium, portrait work(for bokeh), and action shots(you can get very nice shutter speeds of 1/1000 and still have a nicely exposed image).\n\n  Some people believe that just because it has sigma, tokina, or tamron on it that it's going to be horrible. This is not true do not listen to those people. Yes third party companies are known for a slight worse quality control when compared to Nikon and Cannon. But, with those brand names you pay about four times as much. It's your choice. Make sure to test your lens as soon as you receive it. Make sure it doesn't back focus or front focus and that the image quality is good. If there are problems send it back to tamron. They have very night costumer service from my experience. Don't think of buying a tamron as taking a chance. This is a great buy; don't let the name deter you.\n\n  The flare generally speaking is very well controlled. The petal hood helps a lot. But i ran into a few situations where my pictures had quite large lens flares. I was shooting in the snow on a very sunny day and i was very low to the ground looking up. This is probably why it happened as when i took a picture looking at the sun at an angle there was no flare. I had sun spots when i was shooting directly into the sun but that was a special situation. Generally speaking it preforms well with lens flare.\n\n  The autofocus is okay and just not quick enough for basketball or other fast sports. You may want to manual focus during sports, but i got good sharp photos when i shot some basketball games. Up to you.\n\nOverall\n.Great price, 4 times cheaper than nikon\n.great image quality\n.autofocus's on d60's and d40's etc.\n.constant f2.8\n.great beginning lens\n\nLast note. The only reason why i gave it four stars was because, of course, the nikon is better. Heres the way i look at it. There are three categories. Good image quality, good build quality, and low price. You can only have two. The tamron has good image quality and low price. The nikon has good image and build quality. Good luck on your decision. Hoped this helped.\n\nP.S. I am going to put up a few pictures i took to give you an idea of the image quality etc.";Best Lens for a Beginner
92;17.0;3.0;34.0;I don't know about you, but I don't want to lose important photo opportunities while changing lenses - yes, resolution and detail are a must, and I'm quite sure this one packs great quality in a affordable package, but the reason people use zooms instead of primes is basically avoiding lens swapping in the first place - along with price as well (1 zoom vs 2 or 3 primes), so if you are shopping for a walk-around zoom lens, I believe you want to avoid as much as possible the stressing and often risky lens swapping. Considering a study I did I believe you'll be swapping lenses a lot with this one, since it is so long in a 1.6 FOV body. It becomes a 44.8mm lens, for Christ sake, a NORMAL lens! If I made you curious, keep on reading.\n\nMy research:\n\nI have analysed the EXIF tags of all the pictures I took with my point-and-shoot Powershot A520 in certain days. It has a great range (35 to 140mm equiv). I have considered ONLY albums that were about travels or strolling around, no toddler parties were analysed. Boat rides, travels and sightseeing in general only. I made a frequency analysis of the lenses I used for every shot, and lately I compared with the ranges possible of many lenses in the market.\n\nThese are the percents of photographs taken with each lens (converted to 35mm equiv)  range:\n\n35mm - 41,7%\n\n47mm - 7,0%\n\n59mm - 4,0%\n\n71mm - 10,0%\n\n83mm - 13,0%\n\n96mm - 4,0%\n\n112mm - 11,0%\n\n140mm - 44,0%\n\nNow, these are the percentages of the shots taken I could do with each of these lenses on a 1.6 FOV cropped sensor camera. Here are my findings:\n\nCanon EF-S 17-55mm (kit lens)  (74.6%)\n\nCanon EF-S 17-85mm f/4-5.6  (100%)\n\nTamron SP AF17-50mm F/2.8 XR  (74.6%)\n\nCanon EF 17-40mm f/4L USM  (63%)\n\nCanon EF 17-55mm f/2,8L IS USM  (74.6%)\n\nSigma 17-70mm f/2.8-4.5  (82.1%)\n\nCanon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L  (82.1%)\n\nTamron SP AF 24-135mm f/3.5-5.6  (100%)\n\nCanon EF 24-85mm f 3,5-4,5 USM  (100%)\n\nCanon EF 28-105mm f/3.5-4.5 II USM  (58.3%)\n\n*** Tamron AF 28-75mm f2.8  (40.4%)\n\nSigma 24-60mm f/2.8  (65.8%)\n\nCosina 19-35mm f/3.5-4.5  (63.0%)\n\n(I considered 319 shots in my research, should you be willing to do the math. To be fair, I considered 38.4mm to be close enough to 35mm, hence the good results of 24mm+ lenses).\n\nAs you can see, should you believe my research, the 28-75mm had one of the worst coverage-based hit ratios on a 1.6 FOV crop (for the considered lenses). Barely 40%. Even the considerably short Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L USM scored a 63%. Indeed 40%  means a lot of lens swapping. BTW, in a full-frame camera (film SLRs included) the story is another one completely.  The 28-75 coverage leaps to 68.3% of the shots. I personally wouldn't consider anything far from 70%.\n\nThere is a reason Canon packs a 17-55mm zoom with their cameras, though a soft one: it's a pretty commonly used range, as 74.6% of my shots would be covered by that lens.\n\nHave I ever used a ~50mm as a walk-around lens on a SLR? Definitely, and for a long time. My opinion? It was a real pain. Never wide enough indoors (ever been to a crowded restaurant during a stroll around?), never wide enough for group shots (picture yourself inside a trolley car, trying to photograph your friends, as I did once. Wrong lens). Never the creative options even a modest 35mm wide-angle would give you. My idea? You don't want to loose the 35mm range in your everyday lens. It is a great loss.\n\nMy advice? Study another alternative, such as Tamron's highly praised SP AF17-50mm F/2.8 XR (scored a very fine 74,6%, and has the juicy 2.8 aperture as well). Or at least consider a lens that starts at 24mm. These extra 4mm become 7mm wide, and that's a great difference.  A 38.4mm wide angle is no big deal, but close enough to 35mm, and in my opinion a world apart from 44.8mm.;20D, 30D, RebelXT (350D) owners: beware of lens swapping!
101;18.0;5.0;35.0;"I was skeptical about the rave reviews and have had mixed luck in getting sharp copies of Canon and Sigma lenses but decided to give Tamron a try.  I tested the lens on both a full-frame 5D (comparing to my Canon 24-105mm L lens) and on a cropped-frame XT (comparing to my Canon 17-85mm IS lens).  I was very pleasantly surprised that once stopped down a little, this Tamron lens is ultra-sharp and the focusing is right on for both near and far objects.  As carefully as I tried, I could not manually focus this lens any more accurately (even in the bright viewfinder of the 5D) than the autofocus and in most cases my best manual focus attempt was much softer than autofocus.  Not only is the lens sharp, it has the same eye-popping contrast that is sometimes found on the best L-lenses.  Details in the image have a 3D quality not usually seen in ""cheap"" lenses.\n\nComparisons:\n\n28mm:\nThe Tamron has usable sharpness wide open at f2.8 but gets super sharp in one stop down to f4 and slightly better by f5.6.  It is just as sharp in the middle as my excellent Canon 24-105 when wide-open at f4 but not as sharp near the edges on the 5D.  At f5.6 both lenses are essentially equal over the whole full-frame on the 5D.  At 28mm on the XT the Tamron sharpness greatly exceeds the Canon 17-85 lens at f4.5, 5.6 and f8 over the whole frame.  The Canon lens is not soft, but the Tamron is just eye-popping sharp.\n\n50mm:\nSharpness of the Tamron at f2.8 is less than at 28mm but still usable on smaller prints (maybe 8x10).  Sharpness increases greatly by f4 and is almost as sharp as the wide-open Canon 24-105.  Again, at f5.6 both lenses are essentially equal over the whole full-frame of the 5D.  Comparing to the Canon 17-85 on the XT, the Tamron is slightly sharper at f5.6 and gets sharper still at f8 over the whole cropped frame.\n\n75mm:\nHere the f2.8 is quite soft in my opinion (maybe ok for a 4x6) but gets much sharper at f4.  At f4 the Canon 24-104 is still definitely sharper but gets only slightly sharper at f5.6 while the Tamron gets significantly sharper, almost matching the Canon L-lens.  At f8, the Tamron equals (maybe a tad better) the Canon sharpness.  My copy of the 17-85 is strongest at the long end.  At 75mm f5.6 it matches the Tamron sharpness and contrast but does not improve as much by f8 where the Tamron sharpness pulls away.\n\nOverall, the Tamron appears to be an outstanding lens for either full-frame or cropped-frame (if you don't need wide angle).  It does not have IS but does have a usable and fast f2.8 at the wide end.  It becomes very sharp by f4 for 28mm, by f5.6 for 50mm and by f8 for 75mm.\n\nI suspect that the Tamron is similar or better in performance to the Canon 24-70 L which weighs twice as much and costs 3 times as much.  The Tamron matches the 24-105 across a full-frame when both are stopped down a little.  The Tamron is about the same size as the Canon 17-85mm lens, costs about $200 less, but seems to have superior optical qualities, especially at 28-50mm.  It also provides the f2.8 option for increasing shutter speed to freeze motion.  The 17-85 is much slower (f4 to f5.6) but gets wider and slightly longer and has IS for static scenes in low light.  It's a tough choice which depends on the camera and intended usage.";Superb Optics and Dead-on Autofocus for a Bargain Price
76;19.0;2.0;26.0;This is the second copy of the Tamron AF 28-75mm Di lens I ordered, both copies had front focus issues.  Both severely front focus at 60mm to 75mm but at the 28mm to 50mm zoom range, focus was excellent at all apertures, very sharp pictures..I'am very satisfied just using at the 28 to 50mm range but may decide to send it back to Tamron for calibration.

I'm looking for image perfection....and to me, great photography is ONLY about image quality and nothing more.\n\nI shoot with the Canon 7d, Canon XSI, Canon XTI, all great camera if you know how to use their controls...My Canon lenses include 70-200 F/4L(beautiful sharpness) I/S, 400 - F5.6L(razor sharp), 50mm 1.8 (very sharp), 50mm 2.5 macro (unbelievably sharp) 10/22 Super Wide angle(extremely sharp for such a wide angle)\n\nLens Testing: Like most of you I read the reviews, how they were done and see the results, but remember, lens testing is not an exact science and many factors come into play, especially if the lens reviewd is not a great copy.  I put very little faith in lens testing reviews, but enough to make me want to do my own research.\n\nMy own lens testing:  My testing is done in the field period.  I shoot in various weather conditions and circumstances and they all challenge me in varying degrees.  Shooting from the hip, shooting off the fly, shooting at night, bright sunlight, rain, cloudy, cold or hot, moving subjects or even from a moving car...doing weddings, private sessions, children playing etc, etc:...so for me the true test of a lens is to satisfy my appetite for ""impeccable image quality"" in all circumstances.\n\nEnter the (Tamron Zoom Wide Angle-Telephoto AF 28-75mm f/2.8 XR Di LD Aspherical (IF) Autofocus Lens for Canon EOS)\n...and remember, you must have a good copy or send it back, or get it fixed.  You won't be sorry!!!\nI put this lens through my own tests and it surpassed all my desires and hopes, actually exceeding most.  It's as sharp as any lens I have, even sharper than the Canon 70-200 f/4L, as sharp as the 50mm 2.5 macro and 400 5.6L.  For many photographers the standard of excellence depends on Photodo.com and its lens testing results on the MTF scale...Anything with a 4 is an excellent lens.  The 50mm 2.5 macro is at 4.4 on the scale, which shows its incredible image quality.  Not even many of Canon's best L series lenses make it to 4.4.  The Tamron 28-75 lens is not rated on Photodo...I don't know why, probably because if it were, why would anyone spend many thousands on L lenses rated less than the Tamron.  I really don't know the reason why, but I can assure you that the Tamron 28-75 is on par in image quality with the 50mm 2.5 macro as well as any other L series lens Canon makes, but only proof in the field will prove that to you...and if you're wondering about comparing the Tamron 28-75 and the 24-70L canon...make no mistake, the Tamron is every bit as sharp...but how do the other factors stack up for or against the Tamron?...The Tamron is fast, it's detailed, it's clear from corner to corner at all apperatures, at least my copy...and it's quality build...So, is there anything negative about this lens?....why does there have to be?  It does everything I need it to do, especially produce some of the finest image quality I've ever seen...Unbelievable portraits, natural rich colors, perfect contrast and much more...but the amazing thing about this lens is its price.  I purchased my copy for 500 bucks and I could have spent 3 to 4 times that for other lenses which do NOT exceed this lens quality...and yes, there will be others who will disagree with my evaluation and that's ok, but one thing no one can disagree about.  The Tamron 28-75 is much more bang for the buck than just about any other lens out there, but the proof is not in this review...The proof is based on your own standard of shooting and testing it yourself.  Once you do, then you decide if this review is spot on or not!!!!!...and if you don't like the lens, it's simply .... send it back!";"Tamron 28-75 lens  ""A Sleeping Giant"""
16;21.0;5.0;13.0;I have owned this lens since 2013 and I love it!  I bought this after realizing the limitations of my 18-55mm kit lens on my Rebel t3.  I wanted a zoom for the flexibility that it offers and at a fixed aperture.  I researched lenses for a month before deciding to go with this one and I have been very pleased.  I like the 28-75 focal length as it is pretty close to the 24-70 focal length of Canon's L series lens and both have the 2.8 aperture.  Obviously the Canon 24-70 L is going to be a higher quality lens but I was surprised at the great picture quality of this Tamron lens for so much less money.\n\nI have found the lens to produce images with great color, contrast, beautiful bokeh and sharpness.  I did notice some vignetting which seems more noticeable now that I have upgraded my camera to a full frame (6D).  In the bright sunlight the vignetting is more noticeable but nothing too distracting.  I usually crop in a little and its good.\n\nThe focus isn't nearly as fast as Canon's L series but it isn't painfully slow like the Canon 50mm 1.8 either.  Same with the noise, it makes some noise focusing but it hasn't ever bothered me or disrupted a photo.\n\nOverall I love this lens, it remains on my camera the majority of the time!  I may in time upgrade to the 24-70 Canon L but right now I see no reason to do so as I am getting great results with this lens.;Amazing walk around lens!

If anything changes, I will update as needed.\n\nWell the lens is still tight, photos are not tack sharp.  The lens kit that came with it takes sharper images, so it's not user error or my 60D.  Can't return it (30 days) have passed.  Save up a bit more and buy a better quality brand and product.\n\n**updated 11 May 2014**\nI really hate this lens.

The shorter lenses like the stocker 18-55 isn't very zoomable but does have a wide angle aspect. The digital SLRs with 1.6 or 1.3 crop factors benefit greatly from the 28-75mm lens for uses where ultra wide and telephoto is not required. This is a very useable walk about lens. the fast 2.8 aperature is very helpful.\n\nFor the price, you can get other canon or non-canon consumer grade lenses that may have a bit more 'reach' than the 75mm reach of this lens, BUT, they have either much slower lenses (harder to take low light situations without a tripod) or even with image stabilization (that this one doesn't have) or the image quality is far less.\n\nYou will be VERY surprised with the quality of this lens. I have never been one to blindly buy a lens just because it is a Canon lens. Even some of the ""L"" lenses are easily comparable to the off-brand sigma or tamrons.";great all around lens

95;26.0;5.0;25.0;"Over a year ago I settled on a Canon Rebel XT digital SLR, but reviews said the Canon 18-55mm kit lens wasn't up to snuff. One of my main considerations was taking action photos in poorly lit high school gyms for my daughter's volleyball team. The Tamron 28-75mm f2.8 filled the bill. At roughly $350, it was the fastest lens I could afford with a reasonable zoom range. In 2005 I took at least 1500 indoor action photos at F2.8 to f3.2 at around 1/250th without a flash. This year I made every game and took nearly 5000. The Tamron lens continues to perform as well as it did when it was new. With an Epson Photo R1800 printer, I've printed 13""X19"" enlargements for the girls, with no loss in quality. An advantage of the no-flash shooting is that you're less obtrusive, and officials will allow you to get closer to the action. It's also a great way to get a lot of candids of facial expressions and quieter moments between action without an attention getting flash. I highly recommend this lens for the purpose I put it to. There are better lenses out there, but they cost a heckuva lot more. In a little over 1 year I've taken nearly 10,000 photos of all types, and the lens is still going strong!";Best Buy for the Money
86;27.0;5.0;23.0;"The Tamron 28-75 has become somewhat of a legend due to its phenomenal image performance for the price.  Yet, when you take price out of the equation, this lens still holds its own surprisingly well against the top-dogs from Canon and Nikon costing anywhere from two to four times the price of the Tamron.  So far, I've found this lens is consistent with what I've been hearing across the Internet: image quality is at a professional level.\n\nThe lens looks and feels like most Tamron lenses I've seen, plastic but reasonably well built.  The zoom ring is at first a little snug in operation, but I suspect it will loosen a bit over time.  The focus ring rotates during automatic focus operation, but that's really a non-issue in my view of things.  However, everything still feels generally solid and of quality construction, in contrast to the loose and rattling lens barrels, zoom and focus rings of the Pentax ""kit"" lenses: the 18-55 and 50-200.  Autofocus operation with the 28-75 is a bit on the noisy side, but I've found it to be fast enough so far.  What's most important, it's been spot-on in typical shooting situations (a welcome relief to the Pentax DA* 50-135 f2.8 I had to return due to poor autofocus performance and resultant soft images).  Some comparison shots between this lens and the Tamron 18-250 taken in the 28 to 75mm range show that the 28-75 is clearly a sharper lens and maintains that sharpness nicely boarder-to-boarder.  The 18-250, my basic walkaround lens, is a strong performer in that lower range, but it is simply outclassed by the 28-75.  Contrast and color saturation is also superior to the 18-250.  Interestingly, color tone with the 28-75 looks to be ever so slightly warmer.  I've found that CA (chromatic aberration - purple fringing) is present in some rare shots near the boarders such as with the edges of overhead florescent lighting in a gym where that lighting is overexposed in contrast to the rest of the picture, but I haven't seen it appear in many other situations where one would expect to find purple fringing.  At f2.8, I've found that this lens still produces impressive images, especially at the long end, but not quite up to the sharpness at f4.0 and higher. So far, I haven't really noticed any issues with vignetting or distortion.\n\nThe 28-75 is also a full-frame lens, meaning that it is designed for cameras with a 35mm film frame-sized sensor, but it will also work on the smaller APS-C sensor of the Pentax D-SLRs (dedicated APS-C lenses such as the Tamron 18-250 will not work properly with a full-frame sensor).  The positive of using a full-frame lens with the APS-C sensor is that the smaller sensor benefits from being more in the lens' ""sweet-spot, "" that is, the potentially softer/distorted boarders seen by a full-frame sensor for a particular lens are just outside the reach of the APS-C sensor.  Kind of makes one wonder why all D-SLR lenses aren't full-frame.\n\nConsidering the limited lens options for Pentax D-SLR owners, especially higher-end products, this is certainly the lens to have.  While the Pentax APS-C factor of 1.5x, and an effective focal length of 42 - 112.5mm is perhaps not quite wide enough for some shots, it does, however, work great for general use including portraits and low-light interior shots without flash. A nice surprise I found with this lens is that it has an aperture ring which means I should be able to use it on my old Pentax ME Super film SLR for a true 28-75mm focal range.  As I continue to be impressed with the 28-75, I'm hoping that the new Tamron 70-200 f2.8 due out in a few weeks will be in the same league as this legendary lens bargain.";Legendary Pro-Level Bargain Performer

This is a full frame lens. The max aperture 2.8 is available on all focal lengths. Tested this at various focal length/aperture/shutter combos under different light conditions.\n\nHere are my observations:\n\nPros:\n\n1. Awesome value (price/performance). Nikon and Sigma equivalent costs more (nikon way too much).\n2. Decent walk-around lens covering key focal lengths of mid range zoom\n3. 2.8 aperture available at all focal lengths\n4. Relatively fast and quick to focus\n5. Great DOF (min aperture 32)\n6. Pleasing blokeh effect (shallow DOF)\n7. Usable sharp picture at  2.8. Stop down to 4.0 and you can get realy sharp pictures\n8. Surprisingly decent close-up performance at various focal lengths (including 28mm). I was able to shoot a 2"" x 2"" object at 28mm at a distance of about 6-8"". This was taken under room light conditions with flash from nikon d700. The pictures were sharp, and usable. (Will post pics later)\n9. Less weight compared to other lenses in this class\n10. Price, Price, Price !!\n\nCons\n\n1. Sometimes hunts for focus. This could be my camera setting (I have set focus priority for shutter release. I have to change this setting and try it out)\n2. Nikon and Sigma will be better built lenses compared to this (obviously you pay a premium for that built)\n3. AF can be perceived as noisy by professional and hard core photographers. I am an average joe. It did not bother me as I was paying more attention to the picture quality. May not be suitable to take pics in a quite setting without drawing some attention to yourself.\n\nI would highly recommend this lens for anyone who is looking for decent zoom with excellent picture quality and on a budget.\n\nI returned Nikon 50m 1.8D lens&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nikon-50mm-f-1-8D-AF-Nikkor-Lens-for-Nikon-Digital-SLR-Cameras/dp/B00005LEN4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nikon 50mm f/1.8D AF Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras</a>&nbsp;because I was not satisfied with picture sharpness at wide aperture. I needed to stop down to 2.8 or 4.0 in that lens to get reasonably sharp pics. This lens gives me good sharp pictures at f/2.8 50mm. So I traded that lens for this, so that I can also get some basic zoom for about 250$ more. I am not a professional photographer and do not want to start a religious war between prime lens and zoom lens. Obviously prime lenses are better. For an average customer who wants to take pictures around house, kids birthdays, soccer games etc. this lens is a good bargain.\n\nAlso, I bought this elsewhere for about 120$ cheaper than here. You may want to shop around to save some $$$.\n\nGood Luck !";Good Price/Performance Value
97;29.0;4.0;24.0;"It's certainly better than my kit lens.  Very sharp (@ f/5.6).  However, I don't find the ""wow"" factor like many reviewers said here.  I had difficult time to get the right focus at a diamond. Is it because of the diamond or the lens?\n\nAt f/2.8, Tamron lens is soft but still a bit better than the XTi kit lens at f/5.6. Tamron lens is much sharper at f/5.6. I find both lenses perform well at f/9 (Tamron is slightly sharper).\n\nI bought this lens because of the f/2.8 feature.  However, I don't find any surprises for its sharpness at f/2.8.  Is it because I got a soft copy? I posted three tested images comparing Tamaron and the Canon kit lens 18-55mm.\n\nI'm kind of reluctant to give this Tamron lens a 5-stars (1) because I found a few discernable (maybe not) lens flaws, (2) because I only compared it to the kit lens, (3) sharpness is not up to my satisfaction at f/2.8, (4) lens is assembled in China with Japanese and Chinese parts!\n\nI will find out whether I would keep this lens or not after my Hawaii trip.  Hope this helps.\n\n*** Added comment, 12/01/2006 *** I am happy to say that this lens is a keeper. Very very sharp, good focus in low light condition.  Allows to take pretty darn good sharp portraits at 2.8!  Happy with my purchase.  Posted 2 low-light pictures.";Good lens...
109;30.0;5.0;25.0;I had a specific need for a 28-70mm, F2.8 lens.  Having owned lenses of this specification by Tokina and Sigma, and finding that neither was a very good performer, I had some reservations about purchasing another non-Canon lens, particularly since I had no previous experience with any products by Tamron.  After doing some research, and reading a number of glowing reviews at different reputable photo related forums, I decided to take a chance.  The cost differential between the Tamron (including rebate at the time), and Canon's 24-70mm L series lens was a major factor in the decision to buy the Tamron.\n\nUsed with a Canon 20D, I'm pleased to report that the Tamron produces very good results in a wide range of shooting conditions.  The lens is well-built, relatively light, and comes with a small lens hood.  Auto focusing is sharp, fairly fast for most applications, and relatively quiet.  In lower light situations, the Tamron replaces Canon's 28-105mm IS as my general-purpose lens.\n\nThere are reports that some of these lenses have focusing issues.  Another comment is that the auto-focus is slow, which may be true, particularly when flash is not used.  The lens does not produce the greatest results shooting basketball in a gym, or in a variable low light situation, such as a rock concert in a club.  However in most normal situations, performance is excellent.  If you need an F2.8 zoom in this range, do yourself a big favor and give this excellent value due consideration.  In addition, Tamron is very efficient at processing rebates.;Tamron's very solid performer . . .
108;31.0;5.0;23.0;Everyone always compares 3rd party lenses to Canon's L series.  We can't all drive a ferrari.  For the price, this lens overperforms.  I wouldn't trade it for any of the comparable Canon or Sigma lenses.  This lens is enhanced for digital cameras but usable for film cameras - an excellent choice when upgrading cameras in the future (5D for example).  Its sharp and its contrasty.  Only negative is its a little louder than my Canon USM glass.;Not an L but...
20;32.0;5.0;12.0;Out of current 4 lenses which I using, this is only non-canon, all other are Canon L series.\n\nI mentioned 'budget' in headline, please note that sometimes 'Budget' doesn't mean a compromise on quality of pictures. Quality of pics i get is top notch. Compromise is there on other things: autofocus consistency, focal range, lack of IS, lack of weather sealing and probably less life than L lens.\n\nFirst I wish to mention that biggest compromise/disadvantage is inconsistent autofocus system in low light when you compare against Canon 24-70 costly lenses. In some situations, this Tamron will hunt  longer and may focus inaccurately while a Canon L series will more likely get a good focused shot. So, if you have lot of money or you earn decently from photography, don't cheap out, purchase Canon 24-70 L II and no real need to read this review further.\n\nIn good light and normal situations, auto focus will be do a good job (not excellent like Canon L glass). I get decent number of keepers out of this lens specially when I have learnt to use it well with time.\n\nI got Canon 24-105 L F/4 IS lens with my Canon 6D (Full Frame) which i could never love since i mostly shoot indoors and take pics for my young child for which i need faster shutter speed keeping ISO in limits.\n\nWith a full frame, i can use higher ISO without much issue. So, on paper 24-105 F/4 IS L is a formidable lens - 24mm wide while allowing decent zoom range, image stabilization, weather sealing, constant F/4 max aperture. It was focusing well. I don't know why but i could never fell in love with it.... probably it is not really good for portraiture.\n\nI purchased a used copy of Tamron 28-75 F/2.8, used it side by side with 24-105L and finally sold 24-105. This Tamron doesn't really complete with 24-105L, instead it competes with 24-70 F/2.8 L.\n\n24-105 L has very good image stabilization, effective 3 stop 'IS' will be better than 1 stop aperture advantage of Tamron in the conditions when you can (or wish to) shoot with slower shutter speeds. Also, IS is better for hand held video work.\n\nWhat i Like about Tamron:\n1) Very much usable at f/2.8 and get very sharp at F/3.5.\n2) Nice colors\n3) Good for portraits. Yes, i also use Canon 135 mm F/2 L so i know what is quality and sharpness.\n4) It is tougher than my expectation. It may not be built as a L lens but for me, it survived a 2 feet fall on hard marble floor without any kind of damage. No, i won't drop it from more height to add spice to this review :)\n5) Small size and light weight with this focal range make it excellent walk around / general purpose lens.\n\nWhat i miss:\n1) 28mm is not really wide enough, those extra 4 mm on wide (Canon 24-105) side matters. For wide angle situations, i need more switches to my 17-40mm F/4 L which is also an excellent lens. If this Tamron had 24mm, i could be switching less often.\n2) Although i don't really miss extra 30mm on tele side as compared to 24-105mm L, that extra focal length can give you more flexibility.\n3) Lack of IS. IS comes handy for shooting videos and hand-held low light situations specially when shooting still life.\n4) Obviously you shouldn't expect built quality of a L lens\n5) Canon 24-105 IS L even while being max F/4 lens has more accurate AF, silent and more predictable than Tamron.\n\nIt was a difficult decision to purchase this Tamron mainly due to auto focus accuracy issues. With my Canon 6D allowing Micro AF adjustment, i got the courage and purchased a used copy on ebay. I know that ebay is full of lenses which need focus adjustment. My copy needed some good micro adjustment but finally, i am able to get perfectly focused pictures from it.\n\nMy advice to you is to be cautious in buying this lens if your camera doesn't have Micro AF adjustment.\n\nLens i own:\n1) Canon 17-40 F/4 L\n2) Tamron 28-75 F/2.8\n3) Canon 50mm F/1.4 (Sold)\n4) Canon 85mm F/1.8 (Sold)\n5) Canon 135mm F/2 L\n6) Canon 100-400 IS L\n\nOut of above all mentioned lenses, if i need to do a family vacation with just 1 lens, it will be Tamron 28-75 with little regrets!\n\nTamron also makes 24-70 F/2.8 VC (image stabilization) but it is costlier and uses 82mm filters. I have most filters at 77mm and don't wish to incur the expenses of upgrading to 82mm at this point of time, else after using this 28-75, i feel confident with Tamrons.\n\nEdit: 29-Dec-2014\nMy Tamron is still working great:\n1) I think that i have very sharp copy of this lens (although i micro-adjusted on Canon 6D). I am getting prime like quality from this lens. So, it stops me from even looking at options like 40mm F/2.8 pancake or 28mm prime\n2) People often complain of poor corners on full frame but corners are sharp on my copy when used with 6D (full frame), can't say how it compares to Canon 24-70 ii. It does vignet a bit but can be corrected easily into Lightroom easily. Yet, i don't really care for Vignetting much, i end up adding more vignetting via lightroom to most of my pictures to draw viewers attention.\n3) I purchased used Canon 60D (Crop) recently as a back-up body, my Tamron is very sharp on 60D. 60D doesn't allow micro AF adjustment but still its very sharp probably since crop is more forgiving due to greater DOF. Compared the shots at same focal length against 60D's kit lens 18-55 IS ii, simply no comparison, Tamron leaves it behind by miles. If you pixel peep, Tamron captures lot of fine details while 18-55 is muddy.\n4) Sold my Canon 85 F/1.8 because my Tamron is so good at 75mm limiting the use of Canon 85mm while giving me flexibility of zoom.\n\nEdit: 07-May-2015:\nI have sold my 50 1.4 and 85 1.8 primes while Tamron 28-75 has survived the re-alignments in my kits. It shares the same kit which has legendary Canon 135 F/2 L.\n\nTamron 28-75 is not the best lens in this focal range but has best price/performance ratio. If I were a pro entirely supporting my family from photography, I would not hesitate to purchase $2000 canon L zoom but not because of image quality (vs Tamron) but because of more consistent auto focus meaning less lost moments.\n\nFor my kind of photography, I mostly use ultra wide & super telephoto most of time and use smaller cameras (Sony RX100 and Fujifilm X100S) for walk around situations. But whenever I mount Tamron on my camera, I get the quality I wish for. Earlier, when I didn't have those good small cameras, I used Tamron as walk around lens and stil cherish the pictures I shot with it.\n\nI can sell my Tamron only for Canon 24-70 F/2.8 L II\n\nAnother important thing I forgot to mention earlier is that I get excellent results when using this lens with Canon Speedlite (I use Canon 430 EX II), even autofocus becomes better due to AF assist beam from Speedlite.\n\nAlso, i found that this lens is slower on crop camera. I tried it on mu Canon 60D and found that sometimes fails to focus in situations where my canon 17-40 will focus without much issue.;Best General purpose budget lens for full frame
104;33.0;4.0;22.0;"Before I decided to invest my hard-earned nickel in this lens, I did thorough research. I was tempted more than once to shed my coins for an ""L"" series Canon (24-70 F/4) since the raving reviews fly right and left. However, I knew what I wanted and I knew my realistic budget and expectations. After reading a lot about both lenses I decided to give this Tamron a try. With the rather inexpensive price tag I figured I didn't have much to lose. Well, to my baffling surprise, this lens delivered quite a punch! Great colors, great bokeh, great contrast and great sharpness. Zoom creep is almost non-existant, the auto focus is admittedly slower than Canon's USM, but fast enough for most situations. In short, I think this lens delivers the quality of lenses costing four times as much.\n\nMy only minor concern is that the manual focus can be tricky and touchy. However, if you're well-versed in manual focus with other lenses, you shouldn't have much a problem getting used to this great lens' focus sensitivity.\n\nDefinitely a keeper.";Outstanding Performance, Great Value
41;34.0;5.0;14.0;Have had this lens for 30 days or so. Used it for portraits and macro type of photography. Its not a bad lens for the money, would have been nice if it had VR, but with these optics and VR feature, expect to pay much more.\n\nUsed this lens in three different types of scenarios, i will say i had about 80% keepers. I ran into certain situations to where i had enough light, a nice steady hand, but the image still didn't come out as sharp as i wanted. when i slightly overexposed my shots, this lens was awesome. I was also shooting in hard lighting situations, with the mid day sun (too harsh) and indoors. I was able to get some really nice images shooting indoors at wide open (2.8).\n\nAF seems to work just fine, i read some reviews about hunting issues...i have yet to experience such issues.\n\nThe build quality seems fine, granted its no Nikkor, but it seems pretty tight. I wouldnt go out on a safari expedition or anything with it, but it will survive normal day to day use with absolutely no issues.\n\nI highly suggest this lens for portraiture photography and macro photography. I took some really nice shots coupled to my D3100 and also tried this lens with a SB700.\n\nWB seemed a bit off when shooting..left a different tint than what i am use to shooting with Nikkor lenses. Nothing way out there to where i wasn't able to fix it in LR with very slight adjustments. a grey card will help aid in such issues, but again, its minor and nothing worth worrying about, especially if you shoot RAW images.\n\nI uploaded some example photos taken with this lens, again, pretty impressive for the price of this lens (photos by Jesse Martinez).\n\nAs you can see in the pics, the Bokeh with this lens is really good..actually very good.\n\nIf you are on a budget and looking for a nice daily lens, or even for portraiture, this is a great choice especially if you don't want to spend 1800 on the Nikkor equivalent. Granted the Nikkor is slightly better (not by much at all) but this lens will go a long ways for the money, especially if you want a nice lens for macro and portraits.\n\nI am not too sure how well their customer service is, as i have yet to even deal with them, but i was able to call and get a hold of somebody within minutes when i registered this lens online. Rumors say they are accommodating to most, as long as you have the original sales receipt.\n\nTamron did well thats for sure.\n\n:Update to my review: Owned this lens for a year now..has been dropped once, still works as good as new and its still producing remarkable images! Tamron did very well with this particular lens. Im even considering their 70-200 f/2.8 over the Nikkor equivelant.;EXCELLENT lens for the money!!
26;35.0;5.0;12.0;What a wonderful lens.  This has become my go-to walk around lens.  I, like many others, was debating between this and the canon 24-70L.  Clearly I bought this, and I'm not disappointed by the cost to quality ratio.  Would I prefer a 24-70L?  Absolutely!!  However, is that lens worth an extra $1000 to me?  Absolutely not!!  This is a wonderful lens in its own right, able to create fantastic photos that are crisp and vibrant.  It was my first non-canon purchase, and I am very happy with it.  I only wish it was 24mm on the low end like the canon.  I find myself shooting at 28mm all the time, while wishing I could go a little lower.\n\nBottom line: If you are even CONSIDERING this lens, go ahead and get it.  You're not looking at this page if you can truly afford the 24-70L.;Tamron vs the Canon 24-70L? Get this!

70;37.0;2.0;17.0;I bought this lens for my Nikon D5000 to take photos of my kid doing her gymnastics routine (competitions, parties in the gym, etc).  I have free reign while on the floor so I can move where I need to to line up the shot.  Despite that freedom, 75mm just wasn't long enough for some of the shots.  Not the fault of the lens IMO, but wanted to let everyone know I stayed at 75mm the entire time so most of my shots (and this review) is based on pix taken at 75mm at f/2.8.  That said, I'm a newbie to the SLR realm.  It's my first SLR and bought it so I can take low-light indoor shots, hence the Tamron 28-75mm purchase.\n\nFirst, the reason for the low rating is b/c the autofocus is frequently 'off'.  It either front focuses or back focuses in almost half of my shots.  I enlisted some semi-pro SLR enthusiasts to help me determine this so it's not just me blowing smoke.  I can verify this claim by looking at my photos in the Nikon Capture NX software.  On there it lets me highlight the focal point in the photo as how the Nikon D5000 sees it.  The focal point is always in the middle (I use center AF) but the center is almost always out of focus, despite what I and the software say.  Since I'm always at f/2.8 for the low-light action shots, there's not much room for error b/c of the shallow DOF.  It could be b/c of the slow autofocus.  It's not dreadfully slow, but for fast action sports it's best to look elsewhere if you're relying on AF like me.\n\nSilly me, I thought the focus problems were due to only action shots (slow focus not keeping up), but I was wrong.  Even with pictures taken of stationary objects, it will tell you at the time of the shot that you're focused on the center, but that'd be a lie if the frame is full of many different objects.  The camera says the center is locked/focused, but after looking at the picture immediately afterwards, the focal point will be off to the side on some tree just peeking into the frame.  Conversely, when using the Nikon 18-55 kit lens all of the photos are tack sharp, no focus hunting, no OOF shots.  I realize the kit is f/3.5 so I changed the Tamron to the same f/3.5 setting and it still couldn't get the shots in focus.  Sending it back/forth for warranty work is too much of a hassle, especially right out of the box so I just sent it back to Amazon.\n\nI was lured to this lens by it's low price, but what's the point if the pictures are out of focus?  I say there's no value in that type of lens, plus it's too slow for action shots.  I've seen fast (friend's Canon 24-70 f/2.8 USM lens) and this lens has a long way to go to catch up with the USM, HSM, SWM lenses out there.  FWIW, the quality of the lens seems top notch, better than my new plastic 55-200 Nikon lens I just bought.  When the lens did focus, the images were incredible.  Despite my rant, I took some beautiful photos with this lens, but only half the time.\n\nMy hunt for a new low-light lens continues on though.  I have to say f/2.8 wasn't the silver bullet I thought it would be for low-light gym shots.  To keep the shutter speed sort of high (at least 1/200 to freeze motion) I had to keep the ISO set to 1600 or higher so the photos are a little grainy.  Still usable, but I would say barely.  Instead I'm going to look for a 1.4 or 1.8 prime lens to take in more light so hopefully I can lower the ISO to 800 or 1200.\n\nHope this helps the average joe looking for a low-light camera/lens solution.;Out of focus on ~40% of shots
111;38.0;5.0;19.0;I own a Canon 20D and agonized over purchasing the Tamron 28-75 versus other lenses including Canon.\n\nI'm glad I bought the Tamron, because for the money it's an excellent lens.\n\nI use the 28-75 as my primary lens as it's great for portraiture and general photography.\n\nI love the contrast, color rendition and flatness to the edge of the frame.  I've worked with Canon lenses, but for some reason the look, feel and the results of the Tamron really taps into my photographic gestalt.\n\nIf your thinking of going for the Tamron 28-75, I'd say go for it with no reservation.\n\n-- Terry;Rock on with Tamron!

This is my first third party lens, after doing research for several months on the net reviews, in looking for a new all around everyday carry lens. I have enough Canon glass, which are very good, but this particular Tamron lens beats/matches my Canons in nearly every quality category.  Plus, this lens is lighter...and costs much less!

38;40.0;4.0;11.0;"Intro\n\nI heard how sharp this lens was and wanted a backup to the beautiful, sharp,and well-built Tamron 24-70 2.8 VC model that I have. I am an advanced amateur and do shoot a few weddings, events, family portraits etc and I wanted a backup (or something I could consider a contender) of my workhorse should some mechanical mishap or accident happen. I did not buy this lens on Amazon, rather I purchased it from a private owner (professional photographer) in almost brand new condition for $350 USD. If you look around mostly online you can get this lens a lot cheaper used. Just beware, as I found out, you have no warranty if you buy from a second party!\n\nCurrently as of this writing I shoot Nikon with a D700 and D90. In the comments section I will post a URL so you can check out some sample pics I took with this lens so far. Amazon doesn't allow urls in the body of reviews for some reason.\n\nThe Good\n\nI love the 2.8 aperture. I don't know if I will ever shoot another lens that doesn't have a constant high aperture (low f stop number) available. I love the sharp pictures. I lucked out and it appears to me the lens I purchased and tested is indeed sharp and the focus is right on the money. Great IQ.\n\nI have or had three other lenses by Tamron and all are sharp and I am a fan: 24-70 2.8 VC, 70-300 VC zoom, and the old 90mm Macro (sold, great lens, super slow). I recommend any of these lenses including the 28-75 being reviewed.\n\nThe bokeh is decent. Not wonderful, but not bad IMO. Bokeh can be an opinionated issue.\n\nIt is very lightweight. It hardly adds any weight to my D700. This is a good thing!\n\nThe Bad\n\nI never had a problem with my Nikon D700 and I owned it for about a year. When I put on this Tamron lens, I shot a few shots and the auto-focus froze and the buttons on the camera (play, menu, info, etc) would not work. The LCD wouldn't come on. I have a grip. I monkeyed with the Nikon grip buttons and everything came back. I am blaming the grip (official Nikon) and not the lens necessarily, but it was weird and hasn't happened again yet. Just thought I would mention it in case anyone else experienced this.\n\nThe day after I purchased the lens it seems the zoom lock slider button is broken. It will engage in the lens, but when I try to engage it back up, it just sits there and doesn't ""snap"" into place and freely moves back and forth. Not a big deal and I may eventually just put a drop of elmer's glue on it to keep it in place as I doubt I'll ever use it.\n\nThe zoom is very stiff. I have used it and tried to break it in by moving it back and forth zooming excessively 28mm to 75mm and back again. It seems to have loosened up somewhat. This seems to be a big complaint about this lens.\n\nThe hood easily cracks. The hood that comes with it has a big crack in it. I don't know if I did this or if maybe it came like that and I am just noticing it. However it does appear kind of flimsy and weak in the spot it cracked in. I ordered another on Amazon for around $22 (taxes + shipping) OEM. We'll see how this one does.\n\nSlow focusing. This lens does slow focus and hunt in low light. It is supposed to be a fast lens. In low light don't hold your breath. It however has been acceptable so far in my limited testing. Just not fast nor super slow. Just slow enough.\n\nSummary and Rating\n\nI like this lens. I have liked all my Tamron lenses. I especially love the Tamron 24-70 2.8 VC lens. It is much bigger and heavier, but the build is no comparison. The focusing is fast on the 24-70 as it has a USM motor. Finally weather sealing and VC is the name of the game. If you can afford it and are on the fence, I would HIGHLY recommend the Tamron 24-70 2.8 VC. This is my workhorse. But if you are looking for a cheap walkaround lens that has great Image Quality, this lens is el cheapo with outstanding IQ.\n\nThis lens is light, constant aperture with (did I say great image quality), and will work on a DX (crop sensor) and FX (full frame) body. The build is average at best. Although I experienced some problems, YMMV. I also purchased this lens semi-new so it was used once or twice. For all those factors I am giving this lens a 4 star rating. I would highly recommend it to the hobbyist, occasional to advanced amateur and maybe semi-pro. You can't beat the image quality for the money and that's the most important thing, as long as the lens works ;-) . Semi-Pros and Pros, weddings and sports, I would probably look elsewhere or have this available as a backup or secondary lens. The slower focusing and build worries me.";Walk Around and Backup Lens
110;41.0;5.0;18.0;Bought this as a general walk around lens for a recent trip to Mexico. Was considering the Sigma 24-70mm f2.8 but decided on this after reading a lot of favourable reviews on-line and also because of the slightly longer focal lenght. Had checked out the Canon 'L' lens as I was concerned about compatibility of 3rd party lenses with my 20D but decided to take a chance because the 'L' lens cost more than 3 times the Tamron. I find the zoom really comes in handy as my other 2 lenses are the Canon 50mm f1.8 & 100mm f2.8 primes. I took over 750 pictures within a week and all the ones that didn't turn out sharp have something to do with operator error! Colors are beautiful and contrasty. The only issue I had with this was it was a bit slow focusing in low light ... but I would say it's no worse that the primes I use. Overall very satisfied with the purchase and Tamron will be on the top of my list for my next purchase (telephoto!). Shopping at Amazon is a breeze.;sharp, good contrast
17;42.0;4.0;8.0;"I bought this lens expecting what I got, a solid walk around/touring lens that takes good (not great) quality photos.  I don't want to lug around a heavy and expensive Canon lens when I'm out and about taking leisure photos because if something breaks, I am out $500 with this lens and versus $1500 or more for a Canon L lens.  This lens is currently paired with my 5D Mk III, but I took some test pictures on my wife's T5i.  Below is my impression from both:\n\nBuild: The build quality is sturdy.  It doesn't feel ""cheap"" so much as middle of the road in build.  Definitely a higher quality build than the Canon EF-S lenses I've dealt with, but nowhere near as solid as a Canon L series.  There is a lot of what feels like quality plastic on the body, and the focus and focal length adjustments have a nice rubberized feel.\n\nPicture quality: The pictures I took with my 5D Mk III were very good.  At f/2.8 they were generally sharp, although there was some softness in the middle and a bit of vignetting and really nice compression in the unfocused areas (bokeh). At f/4 the sharpness was pretty fantastic through out the photos and the majority of the vignetting was gone, however so was a lot of that great compression I found at f/2.8.  Over all, the pictures were good, I have no complaints.  On my wife's T5i, this lens really demonstrated to her what her camera was capable of.  The results were generally the same as the 5D Mk III considering the lower pixel count, however the vignetting was almost non-existent at f/2.8, probably due to the crop and the pictures appeared to be a bit sharper in the center at f/2.8 as well... I would say this lens performs best in terms of overall picture quality on crop frame cameras.\n\nAuto Focus: This is why I am knocking the lens a star.  Between both camera's I have about a 25% keeper rate using autofocus.  I'm noticing a lot of back focusing with it in auto focus. It also has some problems finding a focus on targets that are close but still outside of the 13"" minimum focus distance.  On the T5i the autofocus was slower than the 5D Mk III, but not by a significant amount.  On both cameras, when the autofocus hit without back focus, it hit well as the pictures were great.\n\nOverall: It's a good lens, although don't buy it expecting to get your pictures put on National Geographic.  I would recommend this lens for two types of people: People with full frame camera's wanting a lower cost walk around lens or people with consumer grade crop sensor camera's (Canon Rebels) wanting to experience what a higher quality piece of glass can do before jumping up to a higher quality crop sensor or full frame camera.";Good walk around for all or beginner lens for consumer grade
75;43.0;5.0;14.0;I'll give the end of the review to you up front:  This is a fine lens that more than lives up to my expectations, and surpasses them by a large margin. I am using this on a Nikon D700, and the results I get are amazing.\n\nOK, here is the caveat on amazing.  If you ever read the forums of [...] you will come across endless threads and user reviews of people tearing apart lenses to judge them at the pixel level.  My opinion consists of none of those observations.  I didn't zoom in on any rulers, bookcases, or brick walls and examine the results at 500 percent magnification.  What I did do is walk around Austin for a week photographing everything from my family, the plant and insect life at the botanical gardens, night life on 6th Street, etc.  My results?  Amazing, sharp, wonderful color, great backgrounds with pleasing soft out of focus areas behind the portraits.\n\nOK, here is a little on the critical side to consider.  For lenses in this zoom range there were only 3 on the list I was considering:\n - Tamron AF 28-75MM f2.8 - $415\n - Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 IF EX DG HSM AF - $799\n - Nikon 24-70 Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8G ED AF-S Nikkor - $1799\nThe Tamron is the lightest of the three, and if you are already lugging around a DSLR it definitely helps keep the weight down. So, being that I'm not a professional photographer, I feel that the return on investment makes the most sense purchasing the Tamron.  My only worry is that Tamron has been known to have poor quality control with sub-standard copies of the lens getting out to customers.  With Amazon's return policy, it wasn't even a concern with me.  I just figured after a day's worth of shooting if the images were not sharp and focusing properly it would get exchanged for another.\n\nAll in all I'm extremely satisfied, and have over a thousand sharp colorful photos to attribute to this lens in the short time I have owned it.;Review from a DSLR rookie
56;44.0;1.0;12.0;I went through two of these to avoid spending the $1400 on the Canon 24-70.  The first one had zoom issues- you had to turn it VERY hard to get the barrel to extend.  The second copy seemed OK, until I took it to my daughter's Kindergarten graduation and snapped about 200 photos.  When I got home my wife looked at them and asked why they were all kind of blurry.  And it was true.  They were not terrible, but almost every picture was very soft.  So I set up my camera- a new Canon T2i- on a tripod and compared the Tamron to a Canon 50mm f/1.4 prime, vs a Sigma 18-200mm zoom.  Every time, using the same camera and lens settings, the sigma and Canon returned pristine pictures, all in focus with outstanding color representation.  The Tamron just didn't measure up.  Small details were fuzzy in the Tamron pics.  You may get lucky and get a good copy, but I think, as others have said, you get what you pay for.  The Sigma I have is OK, but it too just does not come CLOSE to the quality you get from a Canon lens. I guess I will have to go for the Canon 24-70 or 24-105...big increase in cost, but I don't want to be wondering if all my pics are bad until I get them to a computer.  Having 3 small kids makes many situations once in a lifetime, and I don't want to get burned again.;Nowhere near the quality of Canon lenses
102;45.0;2.0;16.0;"After reading all about this lens I was excited about getting it, however I'm not so excited anymore.  I was in denial when the pictures weren't coming out sharp.  But that's it, the pictures just aren't sharp.  Then I took a picture of a gopher in a grass field, with center (spot) focus dead nuts on the gopher and guess what?  The grass about a foot behind the gopher is in perfect focus.  Now I have to send the lens in for  warranty work.  Can you say ""hassle"".  Right now I'm wishing I'd have bought the Canon 28-135 IS USM instead.  The price is about the same, the focal length is better and the IS can get you into some of the same places the constant 2.8 apperature can (not all).  Anyway, I'm very dissappointed.";Really Dissappointed
39;46.0;2.0;10.0;"I bought this lens based on the wonderful pictures I have seen with it. I am a pro photographer, 100% of my income comes from photography. This lens would fill a great spot in my gear except that the build was horrible! The zoom ring was so stiff it would not rotate but instead ""jump"" from say 35 to 50, returned the next day. Amazon(who is always awesome) overnight end me another to try, when I received it had the same issue! Before I contacted amazon again I called tamron USA, where they informed me that yes this sounds like a defect and would be fixable under warrenty. The issue though is I would have to pay to ship it to them! They made a defect product and then wanted me to pay even more money for them to fix it!! Needless to say, I simply returned it to amazon.\n\nImage quality=amazing\nCustomer service for amazon=amazing\nBuild=poop\nTamron customer service=poop";Amazing pictures poor build.
14;47.0;5.0;6.0;This lens produces very sharp pictures, and for the price, I don't think it can be beat.  This lens is on my camera almost exclusively.  I will probably continue to use it for 90% of my photos unless I get a Nikon zoom lens with a fixed aperture, which is likely to be in the $1000+ price range.;Sharp photos!
91;48.0;5.0;15.0;"I bought this lens as a ""walk around"" lens for everyday use. I already have the Canon XT ""kit"" lens, the 70-300USM and much vaulted 50mmf1.8. I did a quick test of the Tamron compared to the kit lens - I photographed the same item with each lens using F4 and the same magnification. Maybe not the most scientific test but it's a good indication of the differences I'll see in ""everyday"" shooting. To say I was stunned is an understatement. I expected some difference, not the quantum leap in quality I saw. The Tamron is ultra sharp, color is great with good contrast, focusing accurate 99% of the time.  Yes you can buy more robust, quieter lens, but not at this price. For anyone looking for quality on a lower budget this is unbeatable. Oh - I now use this for portraits instead of the Canon 50mmf 1.8 -  it's as sharp as the prime for my use, and with this lens needing to use unsharp mask in Photoshop on every shot is a thing of the past. I could not be happier.\n\nupdate Nov 2007: I had this lens start to mis-focus! I sent it to Tamron Canada who sent it to Japan for calibration. It came back - no better! They sent it back again and it seems very sharp again. I used it for a wedding against a Sigma 18-200 IS lens and the Tamron is way sharper and focused in low light much easier.\nEven after the issues I had I love this lens. For the price it's unbeatable. Definitely recommended.";VERY IMPRESSED
63;49.0;4.0;12.0;"When I sold my Rebel XS and made the jump to the Canon 5d Mk II, I knew I would be using the option for my 17 - 55 EF-S lens and I was left with only an empty pocketbook as well as my 3 EF lenses (a 100mm 2.8 Macro prime, a 50mm 1.4 prime and an 70 to 300mm EF lens).\n\nThough full frame offered me a much wider view with my 50mm 1.4, I really wanted something a little more versatile for the proverbial ""Everyday Lens"".  I tried the Canon 28 to 135 3.5 - 6.0 F lens and like it quite well.  However, I wanted something a little faster so I started looking at the l series 24 to 70 f2.8 lens.  It quickly came apparent that it just wasn't financially feasible so I started looking at third party lens options and have eyed this lens for a little over a 9 months.  I finally took the plunge this week.\n\nPros:  regardless of what I have read in other reviews, this lens seems to focus just fine (and as quickly as any canon lens I have used).  The pictures are sharp and when using faster F ratings, I find the ""Bokeh"" to be completely fine.  It is built well, feels solid and is not too heavy.\n\nCons:  Well, the first thing I did was to put the lens on, set it to 2.8 and set it to 28mm.  Lets see what it can do!  Snap..  Vignetting.. Point elsewhere, Snap..  Vignetting.. Granted, I realized my ISO was set to 6400 and I was utilizing AV mode (And was getting very high shutter speeds).  So, I set the ISO to 400 and tried some lower shutter speeds..  the Result, vignetting that was less extreme (although still vignetting).  I set the F up to 4.0 and snapped a picture and everything was fine..  Likewise, at 2.8, I zoomed in a bit more and vignetting seemed to disappear the farther I zoomed in.\n\nI contacted Tamron via email to ask them about it and they were very quick to respond.  I sent them the high shutter speed shots and they reviewed and recommended a lower shutter speed of course.  They even offered to have me send the lens in for inspection.  I was extremely pleased with there response time and willingness to assist.\n\nI am a professional videographer with a love for photography.  I never really higher out for photography sessions but have done a bit of peripheral work when videographing events.\n\nOverall, Even with the vignetting issues, I find this lens to be completely acceptable especially considering the price range of it.  If I shoot at f4, I am fine and for the most part, this will be fine for my needs.  In all fairness, when I open the pictures in Photoshop and apply ""Lens correction"", the vignetting experienced at 2.8 pretty much goes away so though it requires a little more editing, It is still acceptable to me (as I would do lens correction any way on any 28mm shots).\n\nI had the opportunity to try the Canon L Series 2.8f 24 to 70 lens and It did not vignette at all.\n\nConclusion:  If you are budget minded and don't mind Lens correcting when shooting at 2.8F 28mm, then I believe you will find this lens to be a good buy.  However, If you shoot wide quite a bit at 2.8, you may find the vignetting annoying. If you shoot at 4 and need a solid and cost concious alternative, I would definitely recommend this lens.\n\nPlease note, I have not tried this on an APS-C sensor but I would have to believe that Vignetting would not be an issue on a camera with this Sensor.\n\nMy sister purchased my Rebel XS so I will try it on it and post my results when I complete testing.\n\nCheers!";Decent budget option for 5d MK II with some quirks
94;50.0;5.0;15.0;I got this lens one month ago. I use it with a K10D and as long as I can shoot in the 28-75 range I use it! Sharpness is excellent and being able to shoot at f2.8 is worth the extra-weight.\n\nThe autofocus is fast for the price range. AF noise is OK but it gets really noisy when it's not able to focus... But anyway you won't use a zoom with that range for wild-life pictures!\n\nEven though this is not a macro lens you can still focus pretty close (about 1:3, 1:4 magnification).\n\nI recommend this lens...;Best Buy for the Money
24;51.0;5.0;8.0;"I will try and be quick and to the point. I'm a full time pro of 20+ years. My old Canon 24-70L finally died of exhaustion and I found myself in need of a new midrange zoom; so I started researching my options. Being a die hard L lens user, I had a rather rough time even considering a third party lens. I figured it would be a waste of time because for me to switch, the lens would have to perform as well as the Canon while f offering a huge savings... Not just a couple hundred bucks.\nDuring a week of study, I kept seeing reviews on this Tamron 28-75 that did not seem realistic. When I found one brand new online for under $300, I had to try it. I figured I'd just re-sell it once I found the ""deal breaker"" problem.\nIt's been a month with 3 major events and I'm still nothing short of amazed! Everything I read has proven to be true. Sharp as a tack, great contrast, superb color, great auto focus, it lives up to the hype!\nIt's not going to ever out perform a Canon L, However, it is almost exact on image quality and function...weighs a LOT less, is smaller, and most important... is HUNDREDS of dollars less expensive. I can't justify the added cost of the Canon with this lens in existence. I NEVER thought those words would roll off my tongue.\nI'm very happy I found this when I did... Way to go Tamron!";Holy cow... I wasn't expecting this!
52;52.0;5.0;10.0;Let me start by saying that I own and shoot a Nikon 17-55mm f/2.8 lens and have had experience with a Nikon 28-70mm and 24-70mm lens and their quality. With that said, Tamron has had some misses in the past with their lens offerings but everything is right with this 28-75mm version for Nikon cameras.\n\nBuild Quality: While it's not a Nikon, construction and tolerances seem tight. No rattles, and the zoom ring is a bit stiff out of the box. I expect this may loosen a bit over time (other Tamrons I've used have) but for the money, no complaints.\n\nImage Quality: SHARP as a TACK. When comparing this against my Nikon lenses (specifically my 17-55 which optically is pretty perfect) I'd have a real hard time telling you which is which. When you factor in that this Tamron costs less than half (and in some cases a third) of what a Nikon branded lens will run I just become more impressed with the images.\n\nFocusing: Focusing is fast and accurate, even in lowlight settings which is what this lens was made for (f/2.8). I don't ever catch myself wishing I had a Nikon lens on my camera when shooting with this in low light.\n\nValue: Exceptional. Amazon even has open-box versions of this lens (returned by previous customers for whatever reason) that will drop the price below $400. At that price don't second guess your decision, just buy it.\n\nAll in all this may be the best lens currently made by Tamron for Nikon cameras. I've shot and owned the 17-50mm version of this lens and while sharp, this one is sharper. With Amazon's great return policy I say there is nothing to lose.;Most bang for your buck in a 28-75mm lens
30;53.0;5.0;8.0;"I'm a professional photographer, I read the good reviews and I decided to buy it; since I can't afford a Canon red line at this time. Several friends of mine, also photographers, told me not to buy It, thanks god I'm so obstinate and didn't listen to them. This lens is just AWESOME!;  Image quality is nothing to envy to a red line one; Extremely sharp, even at 2.8 maximum aperture, lovely bouquet in a robust, good built structure. I shot two weddings, a pregnancy and a model shoot, and in every case I was impressed with the amazing performance and quality. As a weakness, the lens hood generates a weird vignette; nothing that you can't solve, just take it off and enjoy this beauty. It really worth it!";Expectations exceeded!
58;54.0;4.0;10.0;"I got this lens as used through Amazon market place for D700, from KEH. It didn't come with a box, manual etc, but the lens looked like a new and works perfect.\n\nTamron 28-75 2.8 is one of the most popular 3rd party lenses and I'm pretty sure everyone reading the reviews on this page already have read a lot of other 'eviews on the web. I did that too, and here're my impressions from about couple of month of readings of reviews on the web.\n\n1. It's light and compact\n2. It has decent center resoulution, but borders are soft especially in wide aperture'.\n3. sample variation (QC not so good)\n4. AF is slow.\n5. Cheaply made, too much plastic.\n6. Still pretty good lens considering its price (1/3 of Nikkor 24-70)\n\nHere are my experience regarding the points above.\nBefore that, I'd like to let you know that I'm using this lens with Nikon D700, FX format camera. This lens on DX cameras will give you much better experience.\n\n1. Yes, it's light and compact. It's the lightest mid-zoon lens available for Nikon on the market. 1/2 weight of Nikkor 24-70 and 2/3 of Sigma 24-70.\nThe size and weight of this lens make it a perfect solution for people who need a compact lens for everyday use, but don't want to constantly\nchange prime lenses. Probably the weight of this lens combined with the bodies like d300 or d700 is the maximum weight to carry for someone with other bags to carry. Nikkor 24-70 combined with D700 is almost 4 lb.\n\n2. Resolution is pretty good, IMO, especially at wide end. Reviews on the web point out that this lens suffers from border softness, but I'm using this lens on FX format camera and no problem on border sharpness from f4. At f2.8, center is still pretty good and border sharpness is not usually important for the shots taken with f2.8. However, mine is quite soft even at center at around 50-70mm focal lengths, even at f4. It's not terrible, but still noticeable. It can be just mine because most of reviews on the web says center resolution is excellent for all aperture and zoom range.\n\n3. I haven't tried other copies.\n\n4. I disagree with this. Mine is BIM (built in motor) version, which is konwn to have a slow AF, but mine focuses pretty fast. I have no complaint about Af  speed. Compared to 50mm f1.4D which is known to have a fast AF, Tamron 28-75 is not siginificantly slower than 50 1.4D. Again, it's for my copy and there may be sample variation.\n\n5. agree/disagree. If someone have seen Nikkor 24-70, it surely is cheaply made. It uses a lot of plastic, which makes it light, but I wouldn't say it's cheaply made. Also, lens mount is metal unlike some other ""cheaply made"" lenses.\nOne gripe is that the zoom ring is little loose. If you don't lock the zoom ring (at 28mm) and walk while holding the camera, you may fine the zoom ring at around 50mm.\n\n6. Yes it is. Even if you don't consider its price, it's still a reasonably well performing mid-zoom lens. It may be the only solution for a compact mid-zoom lens for Nikons. If you can give up constant f2.8, there might be other lenses to consider, but if you need a compact mid-zoom lens with constant f2.8 for Nikon, it's for you.\n\nEven if there are some weaknesses, it's 1/3 price of Nikkor. I recommend this lens for amateur photographers who look for a compact mid-zoom lens.\nIf you are a professional photographer, probably you wouldn't even open this page : )";web reviews vs. my experience
3;55.0;5.0;14.0;When I bought my Canon 20D recently, I really needed to get a lens for mostly indoor shots. I needed something that was affordable (the cost of the 20D wiped me out) and a continuous 2.8. I was hesitant to buy a non-Canon lens but this lens is fantastic!\n\nIt takes excellent pictures. And it is so affordable! I truly can't say enough good things about it. I almost never take it off my camera.;Thrilled with this lens
96;56.0;4.0;13.0;Like most reviewers I did some research and read nothing but good things. This lens is physically a lightweight, but can hold it own optically with the heavyweights. The build quality is not completely to my liking. I have a Sigma 18-50mm f/2.8 EX and a Tokina 12-24mm f/4 and both seem to be built to higher standards.\n\nThe Tamron's lightweight and optics make it a nice addition to my kit. The AF is fast and accurate in decent lighting, but it seems to hunt a bit in low-light. The only lenses I have used that have high performance in low-light are Canon's USM (L and non-L).\n\nAside from the build and lackluster low-light AF performance, this lens is a nice alternative to the higher priced Canon 24-70L. If you are on a budget and want constant f/2.8 with high quality images, look no further than this. If you are a lens snob and are bothered by the feeling of plastic in your hands, this is not for you.;Great lens at a good price.
45;57.0;5.0;9.0;"Well, I like others, did not want to like this lens. I wanted an excuse to buy an L series lens, the 24-70. I rented it just to SEE if I liked it but I expected that it would just take ""ok"" pictures and that I would still want the Canon. That said, I REALLY liked this lens. I had it for a week, I shot 4 portrait sessions - a newborn, 3 month old, 4 year old, and a maternity session. I was so happy with ALL of my photos, great bokeh and the colors were so good! The quality of this lens really helped cut down my editing time. I shot a session in the morning and by that afternoon, i had 70 something pictures to give to the client because all I had to do was a few minor adjustments and we were good to go. The lens was really sharp and just the right amount of DOF, I could center focus on the eyes and the whole body of the kid I was photographing would be in focus with the background just blurry enough. I pretty much shot at f 28 the whole time but I did some landscape photos with various other apertures and was pleased with those photos as well.\n\nI haven't used the 24-70 Canon lens, so I can't compare directly with it, but I have friends that use it and comparing my pictures with theirs at similar apertures and subjects, the Tamron held it's own.  I am just starting out so I can't justify the $1400 for the Canon right now but I plan on purchasing the Tamron and maybe a Canon in the future. I am super happy with this lens!";Pleasantly Suprised
46;58.0;3.0;9.0;Read almost all 250 reviews and decided taking the risk was worth it.\n\nWrong.\n\nIQ was great on the photos that the lens focused on.\nAfter about a day of shooting, the lens just stopped focusing on my D90.\nJust stopped.\n\nDid all the tricks that I could think of to kickstart it back to life, (took it off, reattached it, switched the camera on, off etc) but the lens just behaved erratic from that point on. Really sad. I loved the lens. Sharp, light, relatively cheap. Goddamn it Tamron, get your act together.\n\nNot sure what I am going to replace this with. I don't feel like giving $1800 away to Nikon.

I don't understand why this is such a struggle.\n\nLens on the way back to Amazon.\n\nUpdate Aug 2012:\n\nFrom sheer lack of practically priced alternatives, I ordered another Tamron 28-75 2.8 from Amazon. This time, I was in luck. It has been a few months now, and it works great. It is light and very good quality...sharp sharp pictures....great IQ. I am not a professional photographer (what I do pays more:)), but I get fairly picky with quality. So there.;Great lens but unreliable
106;59.0;5.0;13.0;My copy of this lens is excellent.  I was in the market for a lens to cover approximately 24-80mm for inside, low light candids of our toddler.  I have a Canon EF 50 f/1.4 and 85 f/1.8, but the 85 is too long on a DSLR for my needs and the 50 was not versatile enough and was too long at times.  I looked at the Canon 24-70 f/2.8L and the 24-105 f/4L.  Even though they are consistently rated as two of the best Canon lenses, I could not justify the expense.  While I love the quality provided by a high end lens, I am not a professional and do not sell my pictures.  After weeks of research, I reluctantly bought my first piece of non-Canon glass.  The 7 year warranty offered by Tamron provided some comfort, but I was nervous.  After just a few shots, my fears disappeared.  This is a really good lens!! I have a Digital Rebel and the pictures with this lens can be cropped 300% and still be sharp.  While the Canon 85 f/1.8 is sharper at 2.8 when compared side by side, the Tamrom pics are very sharp and pop off the page.  The ability to shoot at 2.8 throughout the range is a big plus and allows for great shots even when the lighting is not so good -- and the subject is running across the room.  For the price, this lens is a great value compared to the Canon L lenses that cover this range.  I would highly recommend this lens.;Crisp, sharp, versatile and affordable
90;60.0;5.0;12.0;"This lens has impressed me to no end. It is incredibly sharp even wide open. The zoom range is extremely handy. The build quality is excellent. Now, to be fair, the first one I got I had to send back because it was ""front focusing"" but I had NO problems returning it and getting a new one which was perfect! This lens is an exceptional deal and with the Sony A100 you get the benefit of image stabilization added to this incredibly sharp fast lens!!!\n\nIt's my new best friend!";Absolutely Stunning Image Quality
65;61.0;5.0;10.0;"I have been using the Tamron 28-75 f/2.8 on my rebel xsi for almost a year now and am absolutely thrilled with it1  The image quality is amazing for such an affordable lens.  The build quality and auto focus are not up to Canon's ""L"" standards, but neither is its price.  When I bought it in April 2009, it was less than $400 new.  Besides, in my opinion the most important characteristic of a lens is the image quality it produces and the Tamron 28-75 knocks the IQ out of the park!\n\nI recently had the opportunity to compare the tamron side by side with its most direct competitor... Canon's 24-70 f/2.8L.  A friend of mine recently purchased a 5D after switching over from another brand.  He rented the 24-70 for a shoot since he didn't have any canon compatible lenses yet and was very happy with it.  He wanted to buy one for himself but I convinced him to check out my Tamron before he made his decision.\n\nWe set up his 5D on a tripod and took shots of the same subject from 28, 50, and 70mm from both the canon and tamron lenses.  All the images were taken at f2.8.  Comparing the images side by side on my computer at 100percent crops, we tried our own Pepsi challenge.  At 50mm, one of the images was slightly (but distinctly) sharper than the other while at 70mm, one of the images was ever so slightly sharper than the other.  We were blown away after checking the EXIF data on the images to see that at both 50 and 70mm, the Tamron lens was sharper at center of the images (the corners looked to be the same).  At 28mm, we found the canon lens had focused on the wrong part of the image (I'm assuming this was our fault because we were trying to do test very quickly) so we couldn't make a direct comparison.\n\nMy friend was also impressed with how much smaller and lighter the tamron lens was than the canon.  On my XSI, the canon 24-70 looked ridiculously huge!  On his 5D with a battery grip, it didn't look so bad, but it was still a pound heavier than the tamron.\n\nFor less than a third of the price, I think I convinced him to go with the tamron.  Sure it doesn't have a USM autofocus motor or the dust/weather protection of canon's L lenses.  The autofocus has never been a problem for me (although the full time manual focus of the canon was really nice) and as my friend pointed out, you could buy two tamron 28-75's and save one for use in dusty environments and still have saved several hundred dollars over the canon.";A worthy alterative to pricy comparable lenses
53;62.0;5.0;9.0;"I recently purchased a Canon 60D camera, and decided that I needed a wide angle zoom lens that would go slightly telephoto with a cropped sensor camera, to compliment my 17-50mm Tamron lens.  I went to a local (well nearly local) camera store that stocked both Canon and Tamron lenses.  It was a bright sunny day, and I shot a number of pics in RAW, both indoors and out with both this Tamron lens and the $1,425 Canon Zoom Wide Angle-Telephoto EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM.  I took pictures at varying zooms, and of varying aperture preferred shutter speeds at ISO 100, outside, and ISO 400 inside.  In all, I shot 37 photos.  When I got home I loaded the photos into Adobe Lightroom and examined them.  The first thing that struck me was how similar the results were from the two lenses.  Upon closer inspection, in the fully zoomed (70mm) position the Canon exhibited a very small amount of barrel distortion that the Tamron didn't even at 75mm zoom.  Similarly, the Canon exhibited more edge distortion than the Tamron at each of the lens' widest angle (to be fair to the Canon I was comparing Canon's 24mm to the Tamron's 28).  This totally confused me.  Then all was made clear upon reading reviews of the Tamron lens from various web sources.  It seems that this Tamron lens is a no-go for full frame cameras like the 5D or film 35mm cameras.  On cropped sensor cameras, however, because of the physics of the optics, the lens projects its ""sweetest"" image onto the cropped sensor.  The result is that the photos are amazingly free of distortion.\n\nOf course, if you are an L-series snob using a 7D or lesser cropped sensor Canon camera, you will probably buy the Canon lens (but you probably buy Monster Cable for speakers, and $1400 power cords), no matter what the reality actually is.  On the other hand, if like me, you are trying to maximize your purchase power and obtain the highest quality possible, you would be an idiot to choose the Canon lens over this one at this cost differential.  If you are a 5D or other full sensor camera user, you should do some research because this lens is probably not for you.  For $500 you get a whole lot more than you are going to expect from this lens, even some very usable macro capability.\n\nIn the short time I've owned it, this lens has ben on my camera more than any other lens I own.  This is the perfect compromise between wide angle and telephoto in a comfortable f2.8 (full range) zoom lens.  You won't regret purchasing this lens.";Better than Canon EF 24-70mm L-Series for 1/3 the price
42;63.0;5.0;8.0;I've purchased this Tamron lens back in 2006 and it has been my favorite go-to lens ever since.  My brother in-law is a prime Canon L lens snob (lol), but even he gets amazed with some of the photos I've taken with this versatile zoom lens. I don't mind the plastic construction at all since it ends up being very light-weight and it has been perfectly sturdy over the years. I find it amusing that the price of the lens has been steadily increasing over the years, but it's not surprising given its performance and quality. I have several primes of my own, but I hardly ever grab those other than for specific needs such as for wide angle or for telephoto. This lens will give you the L glass performance at a fraction of the price. Please see my hummingbird photos  for examples.;My workhorse lens
59;64.0;5.0;9.0;"First of all, I will say this is an excellent lens. I will not say it is perfect, but to be perfectly honest, nor is the canon 24-70.\n\nI have had this lens for about a year and a half, long enough to know how to get the best out of it, and let me tell you, you can get some fantastic results from this lens if you really get to know it. Great sharpness, but not wide open, range, fantastically light and very cheap.\n\nLets consider the optical characteristics. I should preface this with the statement that I use this lens on an APSC, so I cannot comment about the sharpness at the edge of the frame for full frame. Although, there is some decreased edge sharpness on an APSC, it is not that noticeable. If you place high priority on the edge to edge sharpness on a full frame, I would probably be tempted to get the L. Also, if I wanted to shoot wide open all the time, I would also again, probably go with the L. However, and this is important, if you stop down, even a little, the results somewhat dramatically increase. I often shoot at about f/3.2 and the results are good, which is about 1/3 stops down from open, f/3.5 the results are tac sharp with a little loss of contrast that is better by f/4. The interesting thing is, if you consider the centre of the frame at f/4-5.6 it outperforms the L, but only at the center, the edges remain much softer. It takes a little while to master the optical characteristic, but it is well worth the effort to learn, because in the right hands, it is incredibly optically impressive for such a reasonable price. Not quite the same, but for very roughly a third the price, it delivers optics that are only a very small fraction worse.\n\nThe zoom ring is fairly smooth, and I must say a little smoother than the highly praised tamron 17-50mm f/2.8, but certainly not as smooth as the L. Focussing is nicely weighted, again not fantastic, but certainly better than what many lenses offer. The build quality is a little plastic, but this contributes to the fact that this thing is light. Damn light, and fairly small for a f/2.8 zoom. I mean, if you use this on a body like mine, the lens camera combo is about the same weight as the L series lens on its own. The XR part of the name is a size reduction. The major competitors, L and sigmas 24-70, weight 1.5 and 2 times as much. I can hang this lens + camera around my neck quite comfortably.\n\nNow the autofocus can be a little temperamental in low light. Tamron would make a killing if they were to add their new USD + VC on a lens like this. Although, I think Tamron is optically better than the sigma version, the autofocus is not only a little slow and noisy, it can be a little inaccurate for fast moving objects. The sigma and canon variants both has their own patented HSM and USM respectively for autofocus. I have shot fast moving models with this lens, and unfortunately, the number of misses creeps up to be a little inconvenient compared to when I have used the canon version. I should say however, put a flash with an AF assist beam, like my 430EXII, and viola, the focus issues are far less apparent. It is only when shooting without an external flash that the inaccuracies really bug me.\n\nA final note on the range. I got this lens primarily for portraits on an APSC, which is a good range. For portraits on an APSC, this equates to ~45-120, which ranges from a ""standard"" focal length to a short tele. Any shorter than 28mm and you start to introduce distortions, and a FF equivalent of 100mm is a classic portrait range. The difference between the standard 24-70mm is gaining that 70-75mm range and loosing 24-28mm. As a walk-around, the 24mm hurts you more than you the 5mm you gain at the long end, but for portraits, I would rarely shoot under 28mm anyway due to distortions.\n\nIn short, if you get to know this lens, the results can be fantastic. It's quite outstanding that this lens holds it's own against the L for the price tag. On a budget, the price to performance ratio runs rings around the L.";Bargin optics
29;65.0;5.0;7.0;I promised my wife I would not go broke buying expensive lenses for our camera.  I would love to own a Nikon Lens for my D7000, but I just can't stomach the price, although I am sure they are a fine product.  I read and re-read the reviews on this Tamron lens and it seemed to say everything I wanted to hear.  I have found it to be my go-to walk around lens.  Now I almost never use the kit lens that Nikon supplied with my camera.  I use it to take family pictures and sports pictures of my kids' soccer teams and found I can capture group shots from pretty close in.  I have a friend who uses the same lens on a D7000 as part of her photography business and she is happy with it as well.  It is her main portrait lens.  If you are looking for a shorter lens than your big zoom that works in low light and is fast enough for indoor and outdoor sports, this is it!  I have also taken great shots from under and near the goal in basketball games and am happy with its performance in that setting also.;Very affordable, fast lens with a decent wide angle
36;66.0;3.0;7.0;I bought this lens (Nikon mount) from a local dealer approximately a month ago.  I had read all kinds of reviews online for weeks, trying to figure out if this lens was right for me.  I thought I was making the right choice, but I ended up being severely disappointed.  Before I get started on that, though, let me note that this is a great lens... for the price.  But it's a cheaper alternative to a Nikon or Canon lens, and there's no way around that fact.\n\nMy first impression of the lens was that it was just what I had been looking for... cheap, sharp, and of course a constant f/2.8.  After a week of test shots, though, I quickly realized that I had made a mistake.  The pictures this lens produces are not sharp, particularly at 2.8.  Yes, on a small LCD on the rear of a camera body, they will look sharp.  They will even look sharp on a computer screen w/ no cropping or zooming.  But if you're looking to make prints larger than 8x12s, forget about it.  Once you start zooming in, the lack of sharpness becomes readily apparent.  When you're shooting close to your subject, the lack of sharpness is even more obvious.  It's just not a Nikon or Canon lens, and to expect the same IQ would be a bit ridiculous, in my opinion (full disclosure: I myself expected similar IQ).  Now, when stopped down to f/8 or a smaller aperture, the lens is fairly sharp.  Still a little softer than I like, but much better than at 2.8.  So if you're only going to be shooting f/8 or higher, sure, get this lens.  But who buys a 2.8 lens to shoot at f/8?\n\nFinal verdict: If you're not going to make large prints of your work, or if a little softness when zoomed in doesn't bother you, then this will get the job done.  But if you can afford a Nikon or Canon lens, go with that.  This lens is cheaper for a reason, and if you're anything like me, you will be disappointed with the results.  No, I didn't shoot any brick walls or charts, because I really don't give a s*** how a lens performs in those situations.  I don't shoot brick walls or charts, so why would I do test shots of those?  All of my test shots were of things that I would actually shoot (my dogs, a bootcamp class at my gym, etc.) in real-life situations.  I care about how the lens performs in situations in which I will actually use it, not test scenarios.;Meh
51;67.0;4.0;8.0;"This lens is a great buy. It is a fraction of the cost of the Nikon equivalent. With such a great discount you have to expect somewhat less performance. However, this lens still does a great job.\n\nThis lens is very sharp above f/4.0. At 2.8 is tends to have a some chromatic abberation (CA). You will be able to see this a bit at 100% zoom levels in some pictures. It is not bad, but it is present.\n\nI've also noticed that the lens has a bit of edge softness when I'm shooting in a high-light setting (i.e. outside or when I'm dousing a subject in studio strobes). The photos are perfectly metered (I checked the camera's meter against my handheld light meter) and it just seems that when there is a lot of light, the elements in the lens ghost the edges. When I realized that this wasn't CA but was more like internal flare from the elements, I decided to experiment on how to fix this. What I've found fixes this is shooting a stop down. I typically just set my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nikon-D7000/dp/B0042X9LC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nikon D7000</a>&nbsp;to shoot one stop lower than metered when I use this lens in a high light setting. I've noticed that I don't get the edge glare and then I can easily add the light back by adjusting the exposure in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Photoshop-Lightroom-3/dp/B003739DVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3</a>. This might sound like a lot of work, but if you automate the import settings in Lightroom, you never know the difference.\n\nEven though I've just talked at length about the softness issues of this lens, I need to point out that the issue is rather minimal and most people won't notice it. I had some prints made after getting this lens (without any corrections) and I could not notice the softness. If you are seeking a perfectly tack sharp image, get a prime lens. Less lens elements means less interference with the light.\n\nThe zoom range of this lens is very nice. 28mm on a DX sensor is really like 42mm on a full frame and 75mm is actually 112.5mm (113). It is still a nice zoom range though. I shot a wedding a few weeks ago and I used this lens about 85% of the time. The only other lens I used was an 18-200mm zoom to take longer shots and get the more wide angle looks.\n\nThe auto focus is not as good as in a Nikon lens. This does not mean the auto focus is not good. It just means that Nikons are a little quicker, don't hunt as much, and are a little quieter. That said, this lens still focuses well. It is not distractingly loud; even in a quiet room. I can hear the motor because I have my head up against the camera. However, when I've asked no one else can hear it really. I am still very satisfied with the auto focus.\n\nThe construction of the lens is plastic. It does not have a cheap feel nor does it feel flimsy. The plastic body keeps the weight down which is nice. After carrying this thing around for 8 hours, I was glad it didn't weigh twice as much.\n\nThe lens hood is nice, but it is a little stiff going on and coming off. I'm always a little concerned I might snap it.\n\nThe rear lens cap is worthless. I replaced it with a Nikon rear cap and never looked back. The front lens cap is great and it works just as well as the Nikon brand.\n\nOverall, I would purchase this lens again. I have been very happy with it. At less that 1/3 the cost of the equivalent Nikon lens, I believe this product performs quite well. If you train yourself with this lens, you will produce very nice photos and be happy with it.\n\n-Cheers!";Great Value, Very Good Photos
71;68.0;1.0;9.0;I'm giving this one star because it is useless on a 5D Mk II.  This may be a good lens for other bodies and cropped sensors (although not wide enough for cropped sensor cameras for my taste).\n\nI bought this for my Canon 5D Mk II.  It vignetted very noticeably at all focal lengths indoors but pointed at the sky outdoors seemed OK.\n\nTook it back to the camera store, and they put another copy of the lens on a different 5D Mk II and it vignetted too.  It was very noticeable.  The camera store guy, who is not a rookie, couldn't figure it out after playing around with it for a half hour.  He put a call in to Tamron.\n\nSo even though the lens seems sharp, it was a big disappointment.  I was hoping this would take the place of buying the 24-70 L lens.\n\nFor now, I'll keep using my primes which are great.;Vignettes on Canon 5D Mk II
27;69.0;5.0;6.0;"I already had a Canon 17-40mm lens for my 6D as well as a 70-300mm, but I needed a general-purpose ""walking around"" lens. The 28-75mm range on this Tamron fit the bill, and the reviews were generally good.\n\nI have to agree with them: this is a great little lens at a very good price. Focus is fast and accurate, and relatively quiet. DoF when wide open and at close range is very narrow, as expected, but lets you get images that might otherwise need extra light or extra-high ISO with the associated noise issues. The lens is well-built but not overly heavy. Manual focus, when I need to use it, is smooth but not too loose; this is the 'feel' that I prefer so I don't move past the right spot too easily. Image contrast is good, and images are realistic, without being overly warm/cool or saturated.\n\nUnless I know I'm going to need the more extreme ranges of my other lenses, this one stays on the camera.";Highly recommended for Canon 6D
64;70.0;5.0;8.0;This lens was one I bought prior to starting to acquire L series lenses. I have replaced all other non L lenses with the exception of this lens. It is also the only nonCanon lens I own. I compared it to a friends 24 70 L and the difference in sharpness and color did not justify selling this and replacing it with the 24 70 for the extra expense.  If money was no object then sure just go for L lenses, and I may eventually replace this but currently I still grab this lens more than its share and I am in no hurry to change.  It is smaller and lighter than the 24 70 for a walk around, and there is something to be said for a lens with less of an investment when out for the day.  I have shot entire weddings with this lens on a Canon FF 5D II with phoenominal results. On the last with 600 shots about 95% keeper rate and the shots are razor sharp. You can zoom in to 100% and they are still sharp and clear. I have a friend who uses this lens in her studio on a classic 5D as her portrait lens, which is how I first heard of it.  I highly recommend this lens for IQ and value.;Sharp lens, great price
98;71.0;5.0;10.0;"I didn't want to pay over $1000 for the Canon EF 24-70 f2.8L. I can appreciate the quality of Canon L lenses. I have the 300 f4L IS & 70-200 f4L. I found many favorable reviews for this Tamron. I also found some reviews relating to focus issues. For 1/3 the price of the Canon, I decided to take a chance.\n\nThe first thing I did when I received the lens was to perform a focus test. The lens focused perfectly with my Canon 20D.\n\nThe external construction of this lens is mostly plastic, but the mount is metal. It has a pretty solid feel. The lens is assembled in China, but I'm surprised by it's high quality. Obviously, the Canon L lenses are better constructed.\n\nAs for sharpness, I rate it as ""excellent"" from f4 and smaller apertures for all focal lengths. At wide open f2.8, I rate it as ""very good"" at 28mm & 50mm; ""good"" at 75mm.\n\nAlso, the lens has a 6-year warranty. I wish Canon lenses have a warranty longer than just 1 year.";Best Quality to Price Ratio
81;72.0;5.0;9.0;This is definitely one of the better lenses I've purchased. I'm not a professional but many of the people I've asked in reference to this lens are professional photographers. Most nude photographers even recommend this lens. It gives great portrait shots. The built-in motor does the job with auto focus. It does give a small noise when focusing but it is nothing compared to the images u get. However, i did not purchase my lens thru amazon. I went to Calumet. They r wholesalers for Tamron and Sigma. I got my lens a lot cheaper from them. Do ur homework before u purchase. It could save u a lot of money.;I agree. Outstanding lens... however.
32;73.0;5.0;6.0;In a word, this lens is FANTASTIC!  It's billed as an affordable alternative the the venerable Canon 24-70mm f/2.8 and having shot with both, I can say this lens hits on all cylinders!  I am a professional videographer and photographer and I have had a chance to compare these two lenses side by side.  I will say this: while the Canon lens is technically better in terms of shot clarity, falloff and color faithfulness overall, the difference DOES NOT merit the nearly $1,700.00 difference in price.  And at many aperture and ISO settings, this lens actually beats the Canon!  It feels solid in my hand and gets shots and videos that look fantastic!\n\nFor those lucky souls out there with an unlimited budget, stock your bag with those shiny lenses with the pretty red ring.  But for the rest of us, this lens will make you look like the pro you know you are without giving you the big pro sticker shock!  A great lens for a phenominal price!;The Poor Person's Answer to the Canon 24-70mm f/2.8!
67;74.0;5.0;8.0;"So you know where this review is comong from, I am an amateur. I have a Canon XSi/450D, and about 1.5 years of DSLR experience.\nI thought that the new kit I got was so difficult to learn, but it turns out that my kit lens was just not so good.\n\nThe fact that a petal hood is included makes a nice plus, and the lens cap is the type you squeeze together from the front, so it's easy to get on/off with the hood in place. I leave it on 99% of the time. Good protection.\n\nThis Tamron was a great choice for an all-around lens.\nUsually wide enough, and can zoom in for nice bokeh in the background of portraits.\nThe sharpness(especially on a crop sensor) is outstanding from f/4 on up. At f2.8, it's a touch soft for me, but still very usable up to 8X10"" prints. Much sharper wide open than the ""venerated"" Canon 50mm 1.8 II, even at f/2.8. I sold my ""nifty fifty"" after getting this lens, becasue it is more flexible, and I never liked the shots I got between 1.8 and 2.8 anyway. Too soft.\n\nIn professional reviews, this lens is sharper than the Canon 24-70 f2.8 L! I have confirmed that in a store on my body. I compared their L to the Tamron with a magazine full of text. The text (especially away from center) was MUCH sharper with the Tamron than the Canon L! Much.\n\nSo, 1/3 the cost, and half the weight. The canon lens is weather sealed, and moslty a metal chassis. If those two items are important to you, then get the Canon. Otherwise, the Tamron is the way to go.\n\nI also considered the Sigma 24-70 f2.8, but the weight, filter size and flare resistance were all better with the Tamron.\n\nThis lens works great. My only caveat is that the zoom movement is opposite to the canon lenses, which is a little disconcerting when you switch, but not a big deal.";Great fast portrait lens on a budget
68;75.0;3.0;8.0;"I've had the Tamron lens for about a year now.  When I first got it I was thrilled with the bokeh, color, and quality of the images. But after a little time went by, I discovered that the lens is only sharp when I use the center focal point to focus. It is both difficult to focus and soft (back focusing) if I try to use any of the outer focal points.\n\nThe solution is to focus and re-compose, and while I don't mind doing that, sometimes when you're at 2.8 and zoomed all the way in, the movement required to re-compose creates an out of focus image.\n\nThis has been my go to ""walk around"" and ""family snaps"" lens, but because of the focusing problems, I would never use it in my professional work.\n\nIt is a really good consumer lens, far better than a kit lens. If only it were as sharp on the outer points as it was in the center, It'd be perfect.  Sadly, I've had to replace it with the Canon 24-70mm 2.8L.";Good Beginner Zoom
18;76.0;4.0;5.0;This is an excellent lens.  I bought it for my Nikon D5300 and it's become my favorite lens to use.  I rarely take it off while out shooting, with the exception of the times I need to be a hair closer, then I switch to my 18-55mm lens.  But this lens is beautiful for low light conditions, it focuses quickly and performs beautifully.  My only complaint with this lens is that the auto focus doesn't work with the live view on my camera.  I'm not sure why, but it will only auto focus when looking through the eyepiece.  This hasn't been a major issue for me, only a minor inconvenience at times.;Wonderful Lens, Only One Drawback...
69;77.0;2.0;8.0;I'm a wedding photographer. Picked up an additional D700 to go along with my other D700 & primes. Figured I would give a mid-zoom a shot. Well I did and Amazon just received my return. This lens was TERRIBLE!!!!!!!! The auto focus was the SLOWEST I have ever experienced on ANY lens. The image quality & bokeh were nice, if you could get it focus on the point you wanted. I had to make a +20 adjustment in my camera just to get the focus on point. I refused to even bring this lens with me to a wedding for fear of missing every shot. I have since picked up the Nikon (Nikkor) 24-70 f/2.8 as my mid zoom and THAT LENS is SPECTACULAR! Highly recommend no one waste their time on this lens unless your shooting still subjects in a laid back environment.;Not even remotely professional grade.
49;78.0;1.0;7.0;I waited 6 months from the first time I used this lens to put my review here. I was about to give it a 5 star after a few weeks of using it because it was focusing real fast except for extremely low light condition and the images have been clear. Also focus has always been right on the spot, no back/front focusing issues. The bokeh is wonderful but then I started experiencing F-- error on my D90 just like what some reviewers have said. The error can be fixed by simply turning the camera on and off, sometimes ones, sometimes twice then it comes back to normal.\n\nAt first I said to myself that the error doesnt happen that often and I can get used it eventually. But then it happened again, and again, and again.\n\nIt was not a problem having the F-- error on my Nikon while doing a regular portrait photoshoot because the clients can stay at the same spot and I can just pretend that I am making some lens adjustment while turning it on & off. The real issue came to me on 2 weddings where I missed on some would have been great shots. Imagine bride & groom kissing for a few seconds and my camera just would not focus and would not react when I hit the shutter? I go to the routine of turning it off and back on but this time I had to do it 3 times and once it was fixed, they smooching of the bride and groom was over.\n\nI want to give this lens only 1/2 star because of its on & off great performance but 1 is the least amazon would allow.\nThis ends my used of ANY, I mean ANY TAMRON LENS...................;Would have been great except for  F--- error
19;79.0;4.0;5.0;"This lens is great, I've had it for about a year now. It's really sturdy and well built; no fear of any parts breaking without abuse. Really the one annoying thing is that the autofocus is noticeably slow, and it also sometimes painfully hunts for even easy targets. Don't know if the hunting issue is due to the lens or the Canon 60D.\n\nI'm posting a review because I just did a sweet spot test that I think will help...I didn't have this info when I bought it, and after reviewing it, I'm still happy I got it.\n\nThis lens performs best at f/8 thru f/11, and is good between f/4.5 and f/16. Outside that range, it gets just a touch blurry, and when wider than f/4, there are some actual defects in addition to more severe blurring. The jump even from f/3.2 to f/2.8 is noticeably hazier, and horrible to a decently trained eye, but I guess you shouldn't be shooting at your lens's widest anyway. In terms of zoom, this lens seems to maintain its sharpness throughout and overall is pretty good.\n\nI won't make any conclusions because I'm not a lens expert, but I'm still happy with my purchase a year later.

21;82.0;4.0;5.0;"I spent quite a bit of time researching what sort of lens would give me the very best value as a budget but sharp, high quality walk around lens for my new canon 70D, and this lens just kept coming up. Side to side comparisons between this lens and the far more expensive Canon EF 24-70 f2.8L lens were very, very comparable, and in fact in some cases the tamron even bested the L series super lens from canon. With 2.8 all the way through, and supposedly just tack sharp, i was super excited to get this lens, and thus far it has definitely met and exceeded my expectations. At full focal length there is great bokeh with the nice, fast 2.8 aperture, and at less than $500, for this level of sharp image quality, it was a no-brainer. Awesome lens. Will update in the future after i have had a little bit more time with this baby.\n\nEdit:\n\nUnfortunately I'm not going to be able to keep this lens... I've really liked it, very sharp photos all around, good build quality (lots of little details, like the lock button to prevent the lens from creeping down as it hangs from your neck, as other zoom lenses i have used have tended to do... lots of stuff like that) overall it really is a great lens for the price, especially for that fast 2.8 aperture all the way through... but i kept getting some sort of electronic communication error between the lens and the camera (a 70D) whenever i was trying to shoot video... sometimes it would function properly recording video for maybe 30 seconds, sometimes several minutes, but every time it would just stop recording and give some error like ""ensure lens is properly attached"". This wouldn't do... so i packed her up and sent her off to Tamron in New York for repair. Then they told me that i had purchased a ""gray market"" lens, and refused to service it whatsoever... so i have my hands tied. For the couple of weeks that i have used it, it has been great... but i'm going to have to send it back, i need it for video too, not just wonderfully sharp photos. Not sure if i will try another one yet, this time from an authorized seller so i can actually get it serviced if i have to again... or if i will go for another brand.";Fantastic Lens... if it works right...

The 3rd had slight BF at 28mm and softness at 75mm.\nWhile testing I saw flashes of super sharpness (75mm on 2nd lens and 50mm on 3rd lens).  If Tamron could figure out what's wrong w/ their design so it can be more consistently manufactured, they'd have a real winner.\nI did wish the range were 24-70 instead of 28-75 though...the Sigma 24-70 uses a ridiculous 82mm filter (they should stop at 77mm or the filter prices get ridiculous).;Tamron must make their design more manufacturable
25;84.0;5.0;5.0;This is my go to lens when working events, out side of my portrait lens.  This have enough focal length to cover most of the area shots and group shots.  You will still need to bring a longer lens on most events as the 75 doesn't cut it.  With the 2.8 aperture is wide enough for most situations, I still need my 50 1.4 for some tasks.  The images quality is wonderful and I have no complaints I don't want to say this is L glass level but I haven't seen a reason it couldn't be.  The focus is fast and this lens performs like a work horse.  The price was also a great reason to pick up this baby.;Can't beat this
43;85.0;4.0;6.0;I purchased this lens because I couldn't budget three times the cost for the Canon equivalent. I particularly wanted this lens for use in photographing weddings, as well as photographing wildflowers using the shallow depth of field offered by the f/2.8.\n\nIt's a great lens for photographing flowers, and I'm pleased with the outcome when using the lens at f/2.8. I'm not so thrilled with the quality of images when shooting landscapes though. They seem a little soft at f/11 and greater. I haven't had the opportunity to use the lens for portraiture in low light situations.\n\nI do want to mention something that occurred after using this lens for an entire day. When I put on my Canon 24-105 L glass lens the next day, I started getting error messages that my camera had lost communication with the lens. This was my FIRST time ever receiving a message like this, and the only thing I had done different was use the Tamron lens.\n\nI cleaned the contacts and so far, so good. Then I read in an online forum that some Tamron and Sigma lenses come out of the factory with some sort of oil (?) on their contacts and this can cause problems. I certainly didn't want to destroy my 7D by using a *cheap* lens, so this was a concern. The contact cleaning seems to have done the trick. I hope it doesn't occur again.\n\nAll in all, it's a good lens if you're on a tight budget. But if you can afford the more expensive L glass, go for it. There IS a difference. I'll try to remember to report back again, after using the lens for portraiture.;A good alternative for the more expensive Canon lens
28;86.0;2.0;5.0;I *really* wanted to love this lens, but I was NEVER able to get a clear image from it (not an issue I have had with the four Canon lenses I own). The way it fit on my Canon 7D also felt slightly off - like it wasn't creating a perfect connection. I sent it back. It did (apart from unsatisfactory sharpness) perform decently in low light. I think it would be fine for, say, real estate photography, but it was disappointing as a family photography lens.;Wanted to love it, but didn't.
112;87.0;2.0;9.0;This was my second of three Tamron lenses that I evaluated it had horrible front focus issues wide open at 28mm and at 75mm. Stopped down to 5.6 it was fantastic as well as razor sharp. Even manual focused it was razor sharp down to 2.8 but I didn't buy a manual focus lens now did I.\n\nFor all those that are evaluating this lens once you find a good one it is mint. I don't bother swapping out my 50mm f1.8 anymore its that good.\n\nAmazon on the other hand was a pain in the but to deal with for this particular return. It was within the 30 day return window and they charged me a restock fee. I sent it back as a defective lens which it is/was. I had to call back 6 times to get the re-stock refunded and finally they issued me a credit on an alternate credit card...This was rather unacceptable. The reason as explained to me by the customer service was that the return refund was within the 30-day window however due to return shipping the item came back as out of window. This is not a big deal to me a bit of a hastle uyes but I will certainly continue to do busioness with Amazon they are great to deal with.;Not all Lenses are created Equal

For below $400, you will get the equivalent legendary optical performance of the L lens (without the weather sealing and USM of couse), whatelse are you waiting for?\n\nI got a couple pictures above to show the quality of the lens, too bad the size of those pictures are small.

48;89.0;5.0;6.0;"I am a wildlife photographer and my ""walk around"" lenses are not other folks normal lenses .... I.E. 300mm, 400mm and 500mm. I have a Canon 17-40mm lens that I use for landscapes, etc. but I needed (wanted) a lens in this focal length for general use and a fast lens in the f/2.8 range. I rented the Canon 24-70 a couple of times and really liked it, but was having a hard time with the price of that lens. After reading the reviews on this lens I decided to give it a try ... After all I could return it if not pleased.\n\nI am not one to shy away from expensive lens purchases but I am so happy with this Tamron lens! All I can say is WOW! It is great and every bit as good as the Canon. I am a loyal Canon user so for me this is really saying something. It is not as heavy or as large as the Canon equivalent lens but works perfectly on my Canon 7D and 1D MarkIV camera bodies.\n\nThis lens will not be returned and is in my camera bag (or on one of my camera bodies) every time that I go out. At home it stays on my 7D for quick ""around the house"" images of the grandson or whatever .... so very pleased.";So Happy With This Lens
31;90.0;4.0;5.0;"I purchased this lens about two months ago for my Pentax kx.  I took it to a recent trip to Cancun, use it on a couple indoor activities with friends, and to a visit to Cincinnati Butterfly Conservatory. So far, I am pleased with the results obtained, but I am still learning how to use it to its full potential.\n\nWhat I like so far:\n1. The constant aperture helps with indoor activities and when trying to play with low DOF effects.\n2. Sharpness is good at 2.8, and it gets real good after F4.0. Handheld shooting still gives acceptable sharpness with low light.  So far I have done most of the shooting with ISO at no more than 800, mostly between 100 and 400.  Overall is better than the kit lens.\n3. Color saturation is very beautiful. On some shots the subjects look like coming out of the frame or picture plane.\n4. I like the bookeh it creates.  Like I said, the constant aperture makes it very versatile to play with DOF and makes very good effects.\n5. Lens construction looks and feels sturdy.\n\nWhat I wish was better:\n1. Focusing can hunt in low light with busy subjects.\n2. At times it does front focus or back focus when light is poor.  Takes a bit of getting use to adjusting position or selecting the focus location manually. This is what I normally do anyway so it is not a big problem for me.\n3. It is heavy which probably can be alleviated by getting a neck strap with a bit of padding.\n4. It is bigger than other  mid-zoom lens options.  For example it is longer (when closed) than my Sigma 28-300, which would be considered a super zoom.\n\nAs stated earlier I am still learning how to use it.  Sometimes I forget about the shallow DOF  at 2.8 and some of the subject is not sharp. This however is a user fault (me ;o)) rather than the lens.  I suppose the more I practice, the better pictures I will produce with my new lens.\n\nBefore purchased it, I considered the Pentax 16-55 and the Sigma but I chose this one because:\n\n1. The additional long end zoom (75mm). Ended sacrificing a bit of wide angle for the longer zoom.\n2. The sample pictures I saw on a comparison made by DP review between the Pentax, the Sigma, and the Tamron.  Not all the pictures were better, but the difference was not as great to justify exceeding my budget.\n3. The fact that it is a full frame (I know my camera has a cropped sensor but the larger image circle helps control vignetting).\n4. Overall cost. I really wanted to spend less than 500 dollars and this lens fit the bill.\n\nHopefully this helps you in your search.  I will post some pictures to share.  Thanks!";Excellent upgrade to kit lens
33;91.0;5.0;5.0;So many comparisons are made between Canon and Tamron, and often people will say they bought the Tamron version of a lens with the same or similar focal length to a Canon lens because they couldn't afford the Canon lens.  And in some cases, the Tamron is indeed not as sharp as one of the Canons.  Well this lens is the exception. I just sent back a new Canon 24-70 f4L IS lens after I compared it with this Tamron at f4, using all focal lengths.  The Tamron was sharper and had way less (if any) vignetting as compared to the Canon.  I paid 1199.00 (which was a very good price)  for the Canon L lens and there was absolutely no justification in keeping 2 lenses with such similar focal lengths when the Tamron was better on all accounts.  The only edge I saw the Canon having was sharpness at 24mm as compared to 28 on the Tamron - it was a little sharper at f4.  But the rest of the images showed the Tamron was better, plus you get f2.8 and yes, there is a huge price difference especially if you wanted to go 2.8 on Canon.  I have had mine for many years and I wasn't sure how well it would do when I went full frame, but now I know it's perfect on full frame, however I do miss that extra reach I had on my 7D APS-C.  I have always loved this lens, it's one of the sweet-spot lenses in their lineup that will never disappoint.  I have one in the Sony mount for my Sony Alpha cameras also.;"Outstanding (and not ""just for the price""!)"
34;92.0;5.0;5.0;"I make money from my photography and this is my 3rd Tamron lens and once again I am happy. This lens has a solid feel to it and it  is sharp something I have come to expect from Tamron ""SP"" lenses. Like all lenses in this aperture/zoom range it has its limitations but take the time to learn its strong points and you will be very happy with this lens. A very good overall lens for $500, you can't beat that. You will be happy with the images it takes, I am so far!\n\nI have over the last couple of years began to move away from camera manufacturers lenses to reputable 3rd party lenses particularly Tamron and Tokina. I do this because good 3rd party lenses are sharp and well made while costing a lot less. I don't even worry about build quality, I have one Tamron lens that has taken well over 50 thousand photos and is still going strong, it has been a terrific investment for me. I expect this new lens to do the same.";Tamron make some great lenses and this is one.
35;93.0;5.0;5.0;I own a canon 24-70 2.8L which seems soft no matter what you do with it. It's been serviced recently and that made no difference. I've also used the new 24-70 ii which is an amazingly sharp zoom, but costs $2,200. Tonight, while shooting a wedding, the videographer let me use his old tamron 28-75 2.8 since my 24-70 was misfocusing. I could not believe the image quality of this lens. It is sharp, VERY sharp. I feel like it's even sharper than the 24-70 2.8 II. It's seriously that good. My wedding pictures came out fantastic. I'm ditching the canon and buying one of these, or maybe the 24-70 VC if it's anything as sharp as this lens. The most impressive thing is that these can be had for about $350 used.;Extremely impressed.
37;94.0;5.0;5.0;"I purchased this lens to pair with my Canon 6d. The bokeh is amazing and creamy, while remaining tack sharp at f2.8 consistently. AF is much better than the kit lens, but slower in darker situation than Canon's L lens (comparing the Canon 70-200 2.8). For the price, this was a excellent compromise for 1/4 the price of the L series. I'd recommend this product to anyone, this glass is superb. But if you can afford better glass, invest in Canon's 24-70 2.8... For some reason that red line around the barrel makes Canon lens shoot better ;D.";I'm a huge fan of this lens
40;95.0;4.0;5.0;"I've had this lens for a while, but only recently did it get a real workout.  I shot a wedding with it a few days ago, so now I feel as though I have the knowledge to give this lens a rating.\n\nFirst thing I noticed?  AF is a little slow.  I came from a Canon 5d mk II with 24-105mm f4 lens, which is a killer combo.  This lens was seated on a Nikon D600.  There was a distinct difference in focus speed (a difference I cannot in good conscience attribute to the D600, as its AF system is far superior to the 5d mk II).  Although this didn't cause me to miss any critical moments (it was just fast enough), it was unnerving at times.  There were two instances where the lens absolutely refused to focus.  They weren't critical moments, so it wasn't particularly bothersome; I simply zoomed in and out until it focused.  But it's something of which to be aware.\n\nThe lens exhibits what I would call a less than moderate degree of chromatic aberration.  In other words, it does decent in this regard, but is certainly not perfect.\n\nFlare is handled fairly well, though again I would say the lens does a decent but not excellent job in this regard.\n\nSharpness is very good.  It is possible to get fairly sharp shots at f2.8, but stopping down to f4 yields excellent results.\n\nDistortion is not something I'm concerned with.\n\nOverall the lens is a solid '4'.  The optical quality is certainly more than worthy of a lens of this cost, and while the build quality is not the best, again for the cost it is appropriate.\n\nIn my humble opinion, if 28-75mm is a range you can live with (I cannot; this lens will be sold in favor of a Nikkor 24-120mm f4), then there really is no reason to look anywhere else.  This lens is absolutely excellent for the cost, and should be a no-brainer for the amateur or semi-pro looking to dabble in fast lenses.\n\nHighly recommended.";Excellent for the price
44;96.0;4.0;5.0;"Before I start, I will preface by saying this is a very good lens for $500.  If you use a crop camera on most any brand, the optics will be good and performance will be at least satisfactory.  Focus on this lens is moderately quick and accurate in my experience.\n\nI personally used this lens a while back on a 1D Mark II (1.3x crop) and liked it.  It was smaller, lighter, and much cheaper than the Canon counterpart and I was happy.  That was, until I went to a full frame camera.  What I discovered was the entire left side of the frame was soft on a full 35mm sensor.  This was very disappointing for me and I ultimately sold the lens for the Canon version and was much happier.\n\nNow, I don't discount all of the glowing views here on the lens.  What happened was that I received a faulty copy and had no idea until I went to use it on a full frame camera.  On a 1.3x crop or smaller (most of the cameras on the market) I never would have known.  That is one knock against this Tamron vs Canon or Nikon pro lenses - quality control.\n\nSo the Canon 24-70L is $1300 vs $500 for this lens.  What are you giving up for $800?\n- Full frame image quality is better and more consistent on the Canon\n- The Canon is much better built and sealed from the element than this lens\n- The rubber, focus rings, lens coatings, and surface finish is superior on the Canon.\n\nDo these things matter for the average amateur who just wants to take nice pictures?  No, they don't and that is what makes this lens excellent.  It cuts back on some of the expensive manufacturing techniques and higher end pro features and leaves the very good APS-C image quality that this market demands.  The F2.8 aperture also makes this lens versatile in lower light situations.\n\nBasically, if you are recently starting off in DSLR photography and you want a good walk around lens with the flexibility of upgrading to a full frame later on, this lens is a strong candidate.  It's better all around that the ""kit"" lens that camera with your camera, and the price tag won't break the bank.  There are ""crop specific"" (DX or EF-S) lens which offer greater zoom ranges than this lens, but at the cost of aperture and full frame compatibility.  In that regard, this is a unique, affordable lens still worthy of consideration.";Good choice for a crop camera, full frame compatible too
72;97.0;4.0;6.0;"Now let me say first and foremost that I am NOT a professional photographer by any means, but I am a decent amateur photographer and read up on this lens for months before I pulled the trigger and bought it.  My only regret...I wished I would have done it sooner so that I could have enjoyed it longer.  :)  The reviews on this site were extremely helpful along with the images people have uploaded taken with the lens.  After reading this lens review [...] and the ones here, here is my own.  I own the Canon Rebel XSI.\n\nCons:\n* No IS (Image Stabilization).  At first I thought this would be a problem but it's really not.  What it does do is make you really take your time and make you a better photographer.  I do wish it came with it for that ""just in case"" moment but the lens is sharp enough and heavy enough you can overcome this very MINOR thing.\n\n*A ""tad"" noisy.  Yes it can be a bit noisy but it's not as bad as what I had read on a few reviews.  Very minor but compared to my 18-55 kit lens I did notice it but it's not enough to take away from the image quality of this lens.\n\n*Focus can ""hunt"" sometimes.  But it's a very rare thing I have seen in the 200+ images I've taken so far with the lens.  Out of all of those images it's done it to me twice.  That's it.\n\nPros:  Everything else.\n\nThe ""cons"" i noted above are more of a hey you need to know type of thing but they are NOT enough for you to not think about buying this lens.  I have used it in low light, sports shots with my daughter at soccer, nature shots, sunsets, sunrises and they have all turned out just fine.  Would I have liked to own the 24-70L lens?  Sure.  But at 1350 vs. $381.  Not even a 2nd thought.\n\nRead the reviews on here, read the SLRGEAR review and then buy this lens.";Well worth the money.  Don't think, buy it.
73;98.0;2.0;6.0;I bought this lens as a lightweight alternative to my nikkors, to use basically as a walkaround lens. The lens, being mostly plastic construction, is very light, compared to other f/2.8 lenses of the same range. The optics are fine and it is fairly sharp wide open at f/2.8. So, it's a nice lens, especially for the price, but the autofocus just too slow!\n\nI have 2 other Tamron lenses, the 17-50 f/2.8 and the 90 macro.  Both of those are AF-D screwdriver lenses that use the AF motor in the body and both are much faster to focus than this lens with the built-in motor, especially in lower lighting conditions.  I was really disappointed with the AF performance of this lens and returned it immediately. I usually like Tamron lenses, which are usually a good value, so I sincerely hope that Tamron fixes this lens so that the internal motor operates more in line with the speed of other lenses with internal motors. As it is, I think I could focus manually faster than with using the motor in this lens.;built-in motor = terrible autofocus performance!
50;99.0;5.0;5.0;When I bought this lens, even before I received it in the mail I was scared I made a mistake. Before this all I ever bought was Nikon lenses,  but this lens is great. I did a photo shoot with my Nikon D90, Nikon 85mm 1.8 and  the Tamron 28-75mm 2.8. When touching up the photos in  photoshop, one of the pics I assumed was taking with the 85mm since it was so sharp, come to find out it was the Tamron lens. This baby is sharp, I would recommend this to anybody. Now I want the Tamron70-200mm 2.8  and I'll be straight.;Awesome Lens!
55;100.0;4.0;5.0;"I'm using this with a 5D Mark II, and for the price it takes pretty amazing pictures (compared to the 1400 dollar 24-70 Canon lens).\n\nPros:\n-Significantly cheaper than the Canon equivalent\n-REALLY good bokeh; all bokeh spots should appear fairly round at f/4 and below.\n-Decent for video if you're using a tripod, covers most of the useful focal lengths for video applications. The focus ring is pretty smooth, so you can get by with out a follow focus mechanism if you need video in a pinch.\n\nCons:\n-Zoom isn't terribly smooth, so don't try zooming while taking a video (but it doesn't have IS anyway, so hand held video is out of the question if you don't like shakiness).\n-No IS, but I haven't seen one on any lens with this focal range. With f2.8 at all focal lengths you almost don't need it (and the inertia of the lens and the 5D body provides cursory stabilization).\n-Noticeable vignetting at 28mm and f/2.8 when using it with a full frame. The Sigma lens does it too, but the Canon lens does it significantly less. It's the tradeoff for saving $900 over the Canon lens.\n-Some distortion around the edges at f/2.8 and 28mm.";Incredibly good for the price.
78;101.0;2.0;6.0;I purchased this lens to shoot professional bodybuilding show. There are numerous challenges shooting in these low light conditions with the subjects being very dark. The lens didn't focus sharply in these conditions and I returned it. I did shoot some outdoor photo's with the lens and they looked very good. For the money this is a great lens, but if you are going to use it to shoot weddings or other events that may require you to shoot in low light conditions you might want to look else where. For a good alternative check out the Canon 28mm - 135mm IS, even though it is a f/3.5 - 5.6 with the IS you can take great pictures with it in low light conditions and with the extra zoom and the price at about $230 makes it a great deal.;Low Light Auto Focus not good
57;102.0;5.0;5.0;I bought this lens for my a850 and was looking around for a while because I couldn't afford the sony version. Have been using it for a couple of months, and the speed, picture quality are amazing.  Sharp, beautiful colors and out of focus areas.  I have used the Sony version too and they seem to be the same optically, but I will admit that the Sony does focus smoother and quicker so maybe if your a sports photographer that will be better (slightly) but I take sports photos too and this is great.  I would say that the only better lens available for a Sony full frame (in the 20s - 70s range) is the Carl Zeiss ($1300 dollars more than this lens) and is it really that much better?  I'm not getting it unless I win lotto.  For the price this lens is unbelievable.;Absolute bargain.  Amazing picture quality.
60;103.0;5.0;5.0;I don't normally write many reviews for the products that I have purchased but I had to write about this lens. I am a photographer and like most who have reviewed this lens, I didn't want to drop the money for the Canon L lenses just yet. I have been reading the reviews on this lens for months and for some reason it kept calling me back. So after months of speculation, I went ahead and took the chance on this lens... and man, am I glad I did! I waited a few weeks before I wrote this review because I wanted to have a few hundred photos under my belt. This lens is everything it advertises to be and more. It is so sharp, even down to 2.8. It gets even better at higher f-stops. Like most have already stated, it produces great colors and I have taken great outside shots of my daughter right before I wrote this. It is definitely worth the money and the savings from the L series. I would definitely recommend this lens!\n*leaving 2 cents at the door*;Great Bang for you buck... as previously stated.
62;104.0;5.0;5.0;I'm a long time Pentax user and for some reason passed over this superb lens.  Instead, within this focal range, I opted for the Pentax DA* 16-50/2.8 lens.  While that lens has outstanding construction, is weather-sealed, and whisper quiet (SDM), I was never satisfied with that product.  I went through 2 copies and ultimately felt the 16-50/2.8 was too soft, quirky, and with decidedly poor CA.  It was the lens I wanted and tried to love because I felt it rounded out my outfit perfectly.\n\nBut this review is about the Tamron 28-75/2.8, not the Pentax lens it replaced.  I absolutely love this lens - images are tack sharp and CA and distortion are well controlled all through its focal range.  While not weather-sealed and all-metal like the Pentax, the lens is well-balanced and movement well dampened.  This is a full frame lens with an aperture ring which I consider a positive.\n\nI use this lens both professionally in the studio and for portraits, interchangeably with the Pentax DA* 50-135/2.8 (another outstanding lens).  It also makes for an excellent general purpose, walk-about lens - especially when the use of a prime lens isn't ideal (e.g., stationary seating, etc.).\n\nOn a last note, I waffled between the 28-75 and the 17-50 2.8 lenses, both from Tamron.  For me, the additional length is more useful.  When I need to shoot wide I usually reach for the DA 15/4.\n\nCurrently this lens is used with a Pentax K5.  I would buy this product again.;Why Did I Wait So Long?
88;105.0;4.0;6.0;I have very specific needs for a lens of this focal length for the Canon 1DIIn for which it was purchased.  My business does a lot of event and youth sports/school portraiture.  For this, the lens has exceeded it price point.  Center sharpness and color are a good as any Canon or Nikkor I own.\n\nFrom a purely technical standpoint, when testing the lens, it does show softness at all corners- particularly on the top left.  On a 1.3 crop of my Canon, most softness is cleared by f5.6, with the exception of the top left, which never clears.  Center sharpness is outstanding down to f2.8 through the focal zoom.  In practice, for my applications, no weaknesses are visible.  Images are exceedingly sharp.\n\nOnly those who are more interested in testing than shooting will be dissapointed.  In practical use, it is simply an outstanding value.;Excellent Value
66;106.0;1.0;5.0;"I spent considerable time reading reviews on this lens before I bought it. Most, including professional, were positive. I use it on my D5000. For some weeks it performed very well and I thought I had done a good deal. Then it begun to lock up the autofocus. I see in some forums and other reviews on Amazon that this has happened to many others. Unfortunately, I did not see those reviews in time before I bought the lens. I have temporarily solved the problem just as the others have: turned the camera off and on and disconnected and reconnected the lens to the camera. Then it works again for a few pics until I do something like change the zoom, then the autofocus dies again. Tamron says I should send it to them for a check up. I don't know if it will be worth the hassle and the shipment cost. I expect it to be just as lousy after the eventual repair. It is not an expensive lens, but I agree with the other reviewer that says you should still expect it to work properly.\n\nUpdate: After a year I finally got so tired of this problem that I simply took my Leatherman Wave diamond coated file and carefully filed a little on the contacts. I used this type of file to achieve very little abrasion in a controlled way and without risking any dust. I have now used the lens occasionally for some months and it has, so far, worked fine. It is optically and mechanically a pretty OK lens. I have a Sigma prime 50mm 2.8 that takes more ""crisp"" photos. Anyway, I am now happy to be able to use it (trust it) again, and I would upgrade my review to 3 stars (=satisfying but not great).";another victim of the Tamron autofocus lockup lenses
100;107.0;5.0;6.0;I purchased this lens to replace the one that came on my Canon Digital Rebel. It is a marvelous replacement. I used it extensively on a recent trip to Canada and was very pleased with the quality of the pics. It is nice to be able to stop down to f2.8. It does very well in low light also. I would definitely buy this lens again.;Does the job well

82;109.0;4.0;5.0;I compared this to the my 50mm f/1.8 Canon lens (the $100 one). I zoomed the Tamron to 50mm and did some comparison shots at f/2.8.  The Canon lens was much much sharper.  So much in fact, I don't even want to take any more photos with the Tamron.  Based on this experience, I'm upgrading to all L glass lenses.  I'll upload my comparison photo which is an up-close shot of a green pitcher.\n\nThe lens is a good value and I took some good photos with it.  Although, with a 1.6 crop factor, it seems to always be either too zoomed up, or not zoomed enough.  I think this lens is targeted at the 1.6 cropped market but the zoom range isn't very useful so that's why I give it two stars.  If you know that the zoom range is what you want and this is how much money you have, it's a decent lens.;Good but it's not ALL THAT!
83;110.0;3.0;5.0;"I was excited to get my hands on this lens and spent the last 3 days taking pictures of everything and anything. In Arizona there is no shortage of sunshine, so these pictures were under ""ideal"" light conditions.\n\nFirst few shots taken from the office window looked pretty fuzzy. I set the camera to full auto and they seemed better. Over the next few days I experimented with various settings and found the lens rather hit and miss with focus. Items that should have been obvious point of focus were not always so. A few ""difficult"" images of mesquite tress came off with nothing in focus. Comparing to the stock lens, and similar pictures I'd taken with an EF-S lens I'd had, I was rather peeved with it's out of focus images. It was much slower than a canon USM lens and had real trouble in low light finding a focus point too.\n\nI was impressed with indoor shots of fruit using flash, very detailed.\n\nPeople have remarked on the focus ring turning while you hold on to it, which it does, but you learn not to. The reverse thread is also something you pick up on quickly, so neither of these are an issue I feel.\n\nAlso found when comparing photos with the stock 18-55mm my canon XTi came with there was a distinct red tinge to the outdoor pictures taken with the tamaron lens. Nothing photo shop won't fix but a bit strange. Both lenses had B&W UV filters.\n\nConclusion, I may have had a bad lens, it did work well when it could focus. Build quality was also quite good. It's going back and I am going to spend a few hundred more and get the canon. 6 year warranty was nice touch, but I'd probably stick with a fixed focus Tamron lens on a future purchase.";some good results, but red tinge and focusing are a problem
85;111.0;5.0;5.0;"I just received my Tamron 28-75mm yesterday and fired off some test shots while walking around the house and yard.\n\nWow is all I have to say...This is definitely going to be my walk-around lens.\n\n------\n\nI did a ton of comparison shopping between various lenses in a similar focal range -- 16-50mm, 17-70mm, but I eventually ended up picking this lens because I need the 75mm more than the wide angles.  I also compared lots of numbers at various web sites, although not on Pentax mounts.\n\nGREAT picture quality wide open and only gets sharper if you stop it down.  I'm cursed to be a pixel peeper, but I would not hesitate to use this lens at f/2.8 at any focal distance -- it's just that good.  Vignetting is almost unheard of, which isn't surprising since it's a full frame lens and I'm shooting with a Pentax K200D.\n\nZoom feels good and snug -- I don't see myself using the zoom lock button any time soon.\n\nManually focusing feels okay, but a bit of a ""geary"" feeling as you turn the dial, and it's considerably smaller grip than the zoom grip.  Still, it's fairly snug and doesn't have any play in the turn action, so it's decent.\n\nBuild quality seems pretty good for a composite lens body.\n\n----------\n\nI have no problems recommending this to anyone that would like normal to moderate telephoto action .  Very crisp images and great color / contrast and a fast f/2.8 throughout.\n\nOnly one small complaint - Shadow visible in images when zoomed out using onboard flash, even after removing the lens hood.  I guess I should stop being cheap and get a real flash :)\n\nTamron has an excellent lens here and the price is a steal.";Great lens and great price
87;112.0;1.0;5.0;"This is my first experience with a lens, other than Canon and my last.\nAfter the many great things I read about this lens, all over the internet, I got a bad copy.\nI was hoping to be able to use it for a walk around lens, for small items.\n\nThis lens had a very plastic feel to all of it.\n\nI tried it for one day, and I could not get it to focus for a macro shot of a flower.\nI own 2 high quality Canon macro lens and have the ability to take excellent photos\n\nThis lens was a big disapointment to me.  I returned it and bought the Canon 100mm macro lens\n\nIt took some time for it to be credited back to me.  Amazon said they would pay the return shipping cost, it required a phone call, to ""discuss this"", to get my shipping costs credited";"would not focus on a a flower, distance was ""okay"""
93;113.0;5.0;5.0;I can't speak highly enough about this lense, extremely accurate, fast and sharp.  It's not as rugged as the comparable Canon L series lense (which I own) but it's only about 1/3 the cost and my own controlled tests have shown it to outperform the Canon lense.  It also has a smaller O.D. so fitting it with filters will cost less and is significantly lighter which helps when your hauling it around for long periods of time.  My conclusion is this is a great lense for portraits, weddings and general photography, though I still perfer the Canon lense as the ultimate rugged field lense.;Great cost effective lense
99;114.0;5.0;5.0;I have always used just Canon lenses.  After a Canon broke on me after a year and a half and was out of warranty I thought I would try this.  It is a very nice lens with good quality and the 28-75 is so universal that I don't use my 70-300 Canon much any more.  The 2.8 Aperature is very nice at the full 75MM.\n\nYou will like it.;Nice Lens

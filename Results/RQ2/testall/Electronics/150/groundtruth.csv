One thing I like the most is that it does not add a lot of bulk to the iPad2. It has sleep/awake function and same stand position as the Apple Smart Cover. The material inside is soft fabric and outside is leatherette.  It gives enough protection for a normal use, please note if you are in construction business and need a case that will protect the hammer to fall on your iPad and still be ok then probably this is not the one you need to consider.  I give 5 start to this cases and recommend to anyone!!";If you like Apple Smart Cover, You will definitely like this one!

The case folds like Apples, but has a back cover.  The case I replaced didn't.  It stays attached and fully covers the back.  It has a real leather feel.  I liked it so much I've purchased others as gifts.  All in all a great case.  For the money it can't be beat.";Great case at a great price
4;3.0;3.0;5.0;I've had the this case cover now for about a month.  Overall I like how it fits the my iPad and puts it to sleep, but I don't think it should be falling apart this soon.  I use my ipad everyday.  Most of the time I just have the top cover folded back behind the iPad.  On occasion I use it as iPad stand, folding the top cover into place.  Well now the black faux leather is starting to pull away from the top cover, and the edge of the top flap is also coming off.  I guess you get what you pay for.;Not holding up to normal daily use
70;4.0;5.0;85.0;I ordered this for my 3rd generation iPad prior to the original release date, so like many I was disappointed when it turned out not to work with the magnetic on/off feature of the iPad. When I contacted Invellop they offered the very reasonable explanation that Apple had not revealed the sensor changes prior to releasing the latest iPad, so naturally they were not able to make changes till they had one in their hands. They gave me several options, and I chose this one: I kept the first cover on my iPad till the corrected version was released, ordered it, and then returned the original one to Invellop. They refunded the price of the original, plus shipping and return shipping. I'm sure they lost money with this first round of customers like me, but they earned this good review, and the product speaks for itself. Durable, attractive, functional (the on/off function works now), and fits perfectly. Haven't found anything like it for the price.;Exactly what I needed at a reasonable price
9;5.0;4.0;25.0;Update 2/15/2013:\n\nMy iPad accidentally fell about two feet from a table onto a vinyl floor. It hit corner first, but suffered no visible damage. Now the top left of the back portion has become loose and no longer holds that corner of the iPad securely in place. I expected a little more durability than that, but the case did its job protecting the iPad.\n\n--\n\nI've had this case about a month now for my 4th gen iPad, and overall it functions great with only a few minor downsides.\n\nPros:\n- Back portion holds iPad securely in place by the corners with virtually no overlap on the front surface.\n- Microfiber/suede-like inner lining won't scratch screen and helps keep it clean.\n- Magnetic sleep/wake feature works correctly and front cover doesn't flop open when closed.\n- Front cover folds all the way back and even from the rear the magnet holds it in place.\n- Appropriate openings for connectors/buttons/camera/microphone/speaker.\n\nCons:\n- Cover-hinge durability is questionable if it's going to be folded back and forth all the time (as mentioned by a previous reviewer).\n- Tri-folded front cover for upright landscape viewing sets the iPad nearly 90 degrees/perpendicular to the surface.\n- Speaker opening might be a little small, but shouldn't affect volume levels.\n\nOther considerations:\n- To reinforce the cover-hinge, I've added a strip of black duct tape along the spine. It should help with the repeated opening and closing of the cover over time.\n- If you want to use the camera without the cover flopping around, just fold the cover halfway onto itself (microfiber side touches each other), then fold that all the way back.\n- The tri-fold cover design is inherently flawed since it exposes the microfiber lining to whatever surface you set it on - this is not ideal if you have dirty table for example. To minimize dirtying the microfiber lining, I actually tri-fold it inwards so only the leatherette side touches the table. However, this only works with the typing position, not the upright landscape viewing position (it won't stand up if folded that way).;Great case overall, cover-hinge durability uncertain
104;6.0;5.0;51.0;"Revised (again!) on 4/15/12:\niPad 3 version arrived today and it works perfectly! This is  the 1st case I've ever had (I've owned all three gens of iPad) that did ths piece of tech justice. Very highly reco this case.\n\n----------------------------------\nRevised on 3/16/12 @ 7:30 PM EST:\n\nHaven't had this happen often - unfortunately - but this company actually surprised me. A couple of hours after my original post, I received an email from Invelop stating they had a true ipad3 compatible cover being released in 2 weeks and would ship to me as soon as available.\n\nSo, assuming the exchange for the new (fully iPad3 compatible) case goes well, I'm EXTREMELY happy with this case. As I said in my original review, the thing is gorgeous and offers a fair bit of protection with almost no bulk. It won't protect your case from a 4 foot drop onto concrete but for the day to day stuff, it's perfect and, again, it looks and feels great! Assuming the magnets on the new one they send work, I'll likely order a second in another color; they're that good and, at the price point, blow away every other case I've had for previous iPads.\n\n-------------\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nFirst off: cover is gorgeous and exactly the feel and bulk I was looking for. No complaints on design at all - if you're buying this for an iPad 2.....\n\n....which I didn't; I purchased it for the iPad3 that was arriving today. When I ordered the Invellop case 4 days ago, the description clearly stated that it was compatible with the new iPad. It's not: the magnets don't hold the cover closed and therefore do not activate the auto-on feature. A disclaimer has now been added by Invellop (some time over past 24-36 hours!) but it was fundamentally misleading to advertise this as an iPad 3 case.\n\nSecond issue with Invellop is misleading info regarding shipping cost; depending on where you look on their storefront, the cost for (expedited) shipping is anywhere from 4.99 to 8.99; I was charged the high end of that range and while $4 is a ridiculously insignificant amount to worry about in the context of an $800 electronics purchase, the misleading nature of the shipping policy is what is concerning.\n\nI emailed the company to question both of these issues and received a prompt but surprisingly dismissive response; basically the message was, 'you should have waited until after you received your ipad3 before ordering a case'. Not sure how to even respond to that.";REVISED to 5 stars: Invellop product design: 5 stars...Invellop business practices: 1 star
6;7.0;1.0;9.0;"I have only had this a few days but it arrived quicker than expected and it fits very well.  It' seems to be very slightly thicker than the original ""fruit"" product but otherwise identical.  I wish Amazon carried more colors than the black one (for Prime shipping).  It works just like the original product.  Allows a typing position and a ""stand-up"" face time position.  No complaints so far other than color.  We'll see how it holds up over time but it appears to be well made.  Definitely a better value than the ""fruit company"" case for less than half the cost.\n\nUPDATE:  After 6 months of light use, this case is not holding up.  The edges are fraying and the stand mechanism is sagging.  Overall it is stil OK, but I have to remove at least one star because of its quality problems after use.\n\nUPDATE:  Had to remove all the stars I could.  This whole thing fell apart.  Very poor workmanship and materials.  Amazon was great about it.";Great case initially but not for the long term
5;8.0;5.0;6.0;I'm a hard customer to impress and I rarely give five-star reviews. But this case is totally worth it!\n\nRight out of the package it snapped on perfectly. It holds my new iPad 4 securely and snugly. It is an elegant leatherette, and looks phenomenal on the black iPad I have. I have nothing bad to say about this!  The magnetic sleep/wake function works perfectly as well. And.... Compared to the $70 cases I considered, this was an excellent value!  Who would pay $60 for an Apple Smart Cover when this one is a fraction of the cost and works the same!!;Just the form-fitting case I wanted!!
7;9.0;5.0;8.0;Love this case. I did lots of research before I purchased anything for my new iPad, this one had the best reviews both on amazon and you tube. I was also considering the Apple smart case and several others that are offered here on amazon. The quality is great. The price is unbeatable. Good snug fit to the iPad, so I don't have to worry about it coming off. The material inside both sides of the case keep the iPad from getting any kind of scratches. The magnets put the iPad right to sleep, but don't cause any problems when folded around to the back. When the cover is folded into the stand position it is pretty sturdy. The leatherette is sleek and looks nice. The purple color is very nice as well. You won't be disappointed by this case.;Best case at the best price
29;10.0;5.0;19.0;When I bought the iPad 3, I was drawn to the magnetic Apple cover I saw in the store - it was sleek and the sleep/wake feature very cool....but I didn't like how expensive it was and how it didn't protect the back. After doing a LOT of research I decided on this cover and I am really happy with it. It is sleek and light and fits the New iPad (3) perfectly (it snaps right in and is very secure). The sleep/wake feature works perfectly and the iPad can be propped up in two different positions. I found other similar types of covers but noticed that the cover does not fold back flat behind the iPad. This cover does. Very happy with this cover, and it was affordable!;Exactly what I wanted
61;11.0;1.0;18.0;UPDATED REVIEW\n\nSo I had this case and my new iPad for roughly two weeks.  Today I accidentaly dropped the ipad from about two feet off the floor.  This cover cracked in the corner at impact and allowed the iPad to dent.  This might be good if you want to keep dust away, but as a protection device it is COMPLETELY USELESS!!  I now have a 2-week old $700 device that is dented thanks to the lack of quality of this product.  Do not buy this cover!!  Buy something that will actually protect your expensive tablet.  I would not like for anybody else to have the same experience that I just had!!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW\n\nOverall the case looks nice and seems to be high quality,however the cover doesn't always work as supposed to turn the ipad off.  Depending on the cover's position the ipad will turn on and off while the cover is shut.  That is really disappointing since it could drain your battery if you are travelling with it in a backback or briefcase where any movement could cause the ipad to turn on.;Doesn't protect the Ipad at all!!
19;12.0;5.0;14.0;I purchased this case for my 3rd Generation iPad. I've been using the case for about 10 days now, and I love it. The iPad fits perfectly in the case. The cover works as a stand in two different positions, and it folds all the way back (not all cases do). I like the gray color - it fits in well with my MacBook Pro. I would call it a light gray. The magnet is strong enough to keep the cover closed and activate the sleep/wake feature. I definitely recommend this product if you want a cover similar to the Apple Smart Cover but want to save some money. I prefer the INVELLOP case because it covers the back of the iPad, and the Smart Cover does not.;Great Case ~ Great Price
95;13.0;5.0;18.0;This is exactly what I'm looking for, smart cover like functions, and a back case to protect the back. Overall this case is just truly amazing for the price you are paying. It is sooooo much better that the apple smart cover. For many reasong because this case has the smart feature, the stand positions, and it even protects pretty much the entire iPad! Definitely recommend!;Great case for the price!
20;14.0;5.0;14.0;If having a very thin case and smart cover is important to you, this is thebest I've found.  Apples wrap case is also good, but the plasticky material, crayola colors and 1/4 wide extra border make it less desirable for me.  This case provides more protection, has a leather look, and is more stable in both angle positions.  The pink is a lighter color with grey undertones , rather than the bubble gum adolescent pink of most accessories.  The folding panels are slightly asymmetrical making it a little more stable than the Apple case, which sells for $49.  The Apple case is about 3 oz lighter, although its extended border makes the overall dimensions bigger.\nI like that the screen is uncovered without an extra layor with cutouts.  I prefer the triangle folding which takes upmuch less space than the type that has ridges.  The suede like liner  holds well when folded and makes it easy to fold by feel.  The magnet is strong and the hold is secure  What would I change?  I'd love a handle of some sort for holding/ reading and a stylus pen loop, but I wouldn't add thickness or weight.  I looked at many, many cases and couldn't find it all without bulk.;Best Slim line smart cover
66;15.0;5.0;17.0;At first I thought that this would not fit the new ipad and the sleep/wake function would not work. I contacted the seller and he confirmed it fits and the sleep/wake function does work. Looks very sleek on the new ipad and the sleep/wake function does now work. I would recommend for the new ipad as well as ipad 2 really pleased with the smart cover. It protects the ipad really well and does not make it look ugly or bulky. Highly recommend and those of you who have the new ipad I can confirm that this product is great!;Highly Recommended
8;16.0;5.0;6.0;This case is perfect as far as I am concerned, and the very nice price makes it even more desirable.  The feel is great in the hand.  The magnets work very well, not only in waking the iPad and putting it to sleep, but also holding the triangle well and helping hold the case closed when you flip it around to the back.\n\nThere are no cons I can come up with and I can't recommend this enough.;Fantastic iPad Case
56;17.0;5.0;16.0;I have been looking for a new cover for my iPad (3rd Gen) and could not find what I wanted. I had a very nice cover for my iPad 2 but it would not fit The New iPad. After reading countless reviews I finally decided to take a chance on the INVELLOP Smart Cover. I even went with the orange color. I just thought I would try it and if it didn't work well I would return it. I received the case a several days earlier than expected and was so pleasantly pleased by the quality, fit and function. Yes the Sleep/Wake function works perfectly on The New iPad.  I think the burnt orange color is very nice, not too bright and kinds classy looking. The fit is perfect the iPad snaps right in with no problems at all. It is also thin, it doesn't make the iPad seem much larger like my other cover did. As for the quality, I think it is top notch. It feels well-made and the materials seem like they are good quality. I highly recommend this cover to anyone looking for a good fit for their new iPad.;Just what I was looking for, perfect for The New iPad (3rd Gen)
106;18.0;5.0;17.0;Update: The new cover has fully functional wake/sleep function for the new iPad! Great customer care. Thanks.\n\nThe case fits perfectly on both iPad 2 and the new iPad (3rd gen). I bought two, one red color and one black color. Unfortunately neither of covers have the capability to automatically turn on or off the new iPad (but works on iPad 2). Disappointed.;REVISED to 5 star: Great cover for ipad 2 but not so much for the new ipad (3rd gen)
12;19.0;5.0;7.0;We wanted something that worked like the iPad cover but covered the back as well.  The reviews on the official iPad cases are mixed, so we decided to go with this one.\n\nPros:\nThe sleep/wake feature works\nFits well\nall ports and buttons accessible\ndoesnt obstruct with face of tablet.\n\nCons:\nNone that I can think of.\n\nIm not saying this is the perfect case, but if you are looking for something like the official iPad cases but want something that offers more protection, then this may be what you are looking for.;Nice fit, protects well.
10;20.0;1.0;6.0;I got this about a month ago, it looked and felt great when it came.  It started falling apart about two weeks into regular use, and has been falling apart more and more since.  one of the four edges broke off so it doens't hold the ipad any more, and there are threads coming out from the bindings all around as well as some cardboard type material that was used to pad the edges.;looks good, doesn't last
69;21.0;5.0;15.0;We initially got the version which fit the iPad 3 perfectly but had sleep wake issue because APple changed the magnet placement.  The vendor took great steps with many options to get us the new and improved version that works perfectly with the iPad 3.  They handled all return shipping and replacement costs.  A please to work with.\n\nAs for the case... it is a NICE all in one smart case.  The material looks and feels like leather without that smell.  It fits snugly and protects it well.  The iPad 3 can now wake and sleep using the new and improved additional magnet placement.\n\nGot this for my wife and she loves it.  Got the Black version.  It is professional, protective, and priced well.\n\nI am so glad a went with this instead of the apple smart cover which costs so much more and only protected the front.  This product does it all seamlessly.  It can easily be removed from the case as well.. when I want to put it in our Car center mount for watching movies.\n\nGood investment.  Check it out.  You will be pleased and surprised by the quality.  I know I was.;Love it on our iPad 3 - everything works great!
53;22.0;5.0;14.0;I have been searching high and low for a great case that looks stylish, protects my iPad 3, and does not add a lot of bulk. This case is great! It looks wonderful on my iPad and fits it like a glove. The sleep wake function works well. The orange color is more of a burnt orange and very rich. It is not a bright cheap looking orange color. I have nothing but good things to say about this cover. I ordered it on a Monday and received it Friday.;Great Case!
108;23.0;2.0;15.0;A word of caution. Just got my new iPad in the mail and received this case yesterday. While the case does fit, albeit very snug, the sleep/wake function does not work. This will become a common problem until 3rd party manufacturers have had a chance to reworked the magnets in their cases to align with the new iPad. From here on out, I'd be leery of any case that claims to work for both 2nd & 3rd generation iPads unless its made by Apple.;3rd gen iPad owners beware
109;24.0;5.0;15.0;This case is amazing!  For so much less than the apple smart cover, you're getting protection for the front AND the back. This an absolute necessity in a house with children. Mine has already fallen once on the hardwood floor and was unscathed.\nThe orange color is nice too. I was nervous this was going to be a bright orange, but it's more of a rust.\nTo sum it up, I'm very happy with this purchase.;Great!
88;25.0;1.0;14.0;Very nice cover, fits the New iPad beautifully but does not have any mechanism for staying closed at all (other than gravity), let alone securely.  This is flat out false advertising.;Cover Does NOT securely close
97;26.0;1.0;14.0;Unfortunately the seller must have jumped the gun in order to rack up sales for the Ipad3, but the Smart Cover on and off feature just doesn't work at all. I am sure this is unintentional, BUT a major inconvenience for all the people that bought the case based on what the seller said. Now I have to go through the hassle of sending it back.;Fits the Ipad3, BUT smart cover does not work
105;27.0;5.0;14.0;"The case does fit the new iPad very well, however the sleep function does not work properly.  I purchased this on 3/8 under the guise that this would work.  However, INVELLOP changed the description on release day to say the magnets won't work on most of these covers.  I have put an email into them asking if they intend to update their cases, or offer refunds for those of us that purchased them before it came out.  They shouldn't have put that in there if they didn't know it wouldn't work.\n\nUPDATE:  INVELLOP emailed me back and this is what they had to day:\n\nDear Customer,\n\nWe are pleased to have confirmed that the INVELLOP cases fit ""The new iPad"" (or iPad 3) properly.

79;28.0;1.0;13.0;Felt like cheated with the poor quality product. It's sleep function does not work with iPad 3. While the product description says it is compatible with iPad 3, somewhere they say that it is not compatible with iPad3 when it comes to smart function of the cover. Product description is intentionally misleading. Company also refuses to bear the shipping cost of the return.;Misleading product description about the compatibility with iPad3.
100;29.0;5.0;13.0;I'll hold off on technical issues- lets start with the physical case itself.  I'm totally pleased with both the fit and finish of this case. The color is a snazzy, but not garish, burnt orange- its very nice.  The new iPad (2012 model) fits inside with a snug 'snap' in the corners- VERY nice, I feel totally secure having it in here.  I'm very pleased with the hard back cover protection, as that's what took a real beating on my last iPad.  The grip your hands have on the material helps you keep a confident hold.  The microfiber is plush.  Frankly, the case looks and feels a lot more expensive than it is. The magnets inside could be a little more powerful (you can feel the weakness of it when folding the cover into a stand especially) but that's so minor of an issue, it's not worth half a star.\n\nSo why only three stars? The mediocre review (star-wise) is strictly for the auto-sleep feature not working properly as promised.  The iteration of the cover I have does NOT activate the sleep/wake function. The manufacturer has noted this, and changed the description accordingly.  I've seen that the makers want to make it right (and I'd REALLY like a corrected case, please)- so I promise to update my review accordingly once I have the new version of the case.\n\nAgain, it's a fine, fine case- sincerely it's wayyyy more than I had expected.  And the manufacturer seems to be on top of issues (another major plus.) just bear in mind if you have a new 2012 iPad, you may want to hold off on ordering until the makers update things.  I'll update this review, dear shoppers, as soon as I've gotten one of the updated models.\n\n<<<<UPDATE>>>>\n\nA long-overdue update.  My replacement cover arrived a while back, and it's been serving full-time duty since.  I stand by all the positives of my original review- everything is exactly the same- the fit and finish are top-notch!  And now, the neato magnets in the cover are in their proper smart positions.  Great functionality!  I get complements on it all the time, and have already steered a few shoppers toward Invellop while in some of the big-box stores- to stop them from making the mistake of buying a sub-standard cover.;Updated Review- Invellop made it right.

I have had it 5 months and the corners(the only thing holding the pad into the cover) started peeling back and the I-Pad started falling out of the cover. I bought a second case that the ipad fit in with this cover on it to keep it from experiencing damage... Walking down my steps one day- with the ipad in only this cover, under my arm-the ipad fell out of the cover and smashed on the hard wood floor. Needless to say the screen shattered and now I have a $700 piece of junk. When I went on-line to look up the company- I then found out the company posts bogus product reviews on websites (amazon being a primary example) of their own products....I wuld never buy a product from this company again...;Beware!!!
14;34.0;2.0;7.0;I have to say after reading the other reviews I was very excite for this case.  However, it has some major issues.  First, the weight is more than any other folio style case I have tried (and I have tried a little more than a dozen).  Second, the magnet on the front doesn't work well (your ipad will go on off with the slightest movement).  Third, it never laid flat on the screen.  Overall, I was very disappointed, and will not be purchasing any Invellop products again.  I have a feeling you will be disappointed if you purchase unless you never had another case, then you have nothing to compare to it.;Not what you expect after reading the reviews
49;35.0;5.0;11.0;After reading many review said that the cover won't work with the new iPad. All I want is just a case for iPad, so if the cover won't function on/ off the iPad that OK to me. I ordered it on April 27, 2012. After a few days I received. I put it on  my iPad, it fits perfectly but a thing that surprise me is the cover can turn on/ off the new iPad! I tried it a few more thine to make sure that it's not just a coincident. It really works.\n\nI just want to tell anybody out there who wondered if the cover will work with the new iPad, well it works. I think they must have updated the cover magnetic function. But I don't know if it still works with the iPad 2.;It works with the new iPad
73;36.0;5.0;11.0;Great case for iPad 3. Magnets work great, seem to be a bit stronger than the Apple smart cover's magnets. Cover is a bit stiff but I'm sure will loosen up. I'm using it with a Bodyguardz skin on the back and it fits perfectly.  The plastic looks and sorta feels like (dry) leather but it's plastic (obviously) and it seems very durable. I own many different kinds of cases for the iPad's and this is really one of the best that I've tried - it's simple, adds little bulk and the price is just great, my favorite case so far. The only thing that could be improved is to make it in real leather, but that would increase the price.\n\nThinking about ordering another in gray.;Great case for the new iPad
86;37.0;1.0;11.0;This case is in line with Apple's minimalistic approach, however it is falsely advertised. The case in the description does not have a cheesey metal logo like mine and the description stated that the magnetic sleep/wake function would work with the New Ipad but it doesn't. I purchased this product before March 16, 2012. I have now learned that they have changed the description of the product after all of the negative complaints. Not to mention the price went up prior to the release of the New Ipad. This company has shady business practices and I will no longer be dealing with them. I would give this case as a gift...to an enemy. With that said...BUYER BEWARE.;Fits New Ipad but...
13;38.0;5.0;6.0;"Just got this cover, and put it on my newly arrived Ipad 4. It fits nice and snug. I do not feel as though it could accidentally pop out, however this may happen if it gets dropped on hard ground. (will let you know when it happens )\nOrange color looks more burnt and not bright like it is in the photo, which I read in other reviews and bought in hopes of it being ""burnt orange'. Very nice, and just what I wanted. I can see the corners getting dirty over time, especially when my youngsters handle the Ipad, but with this price I just may order a few other colors to switch out the pad look ;). The cover feels like real leather, and is nice and sleek with no bulk at all. What I really like is that the front and back feel the same. (some covers with a hard shell feel like plastic on the bottom and like leather on the opening flap, which I don't like) Definitely looks high quality, but I will re-visit my review if it wears down too much, too fast. All buttons are easy to access. The Magnetic cover also works well. Hope this review helps!";Fits Ipad 4
27;39.0;5.0;9.0;"I'm seriously impressed with this iPad cover.  I enjoy the idea of the smart cover, but I always hated how it leaves the back of the iPad to scratches and dings.  This product combines the amazingness of the smart cover with rear coverage.  I've read amazing reviews and still ended up disappointed when I finally get something.  This was not the case.  I am absolutely impressed with what I received.  It feels very solid and amazingly constructed.  All of the holes fit perfectly where they should, something even more expensive covers fail to do on occasion.  The ""New iPad"" fits perfectly.  It snaps right in and doesn't come out on accident.  Looking at prices on other iPad covers, this one is priced incredibly well and it's not, ""well, for what you pay it's amazing"" its ""amazing....period"".  Great cover.  I've already emailed the Amazon link to all my buddies and parents to buy their own.  If I get tired of the black they have a bunch of colors to choose from.  Very impressed.  Thanks Invellop.\n\n  ***My magnets work perfectly***\n  ***Cover fits snug and perfect***\n***Very Professional looking and feeling***";Best iPad cover i've owned

One thing I like the most is that it does not add a lot of bulk to the iPad2. It has sleep/awake function and same stand position as the Apple Smart Cover. The material inside is soft fabric and outside is leatherette.  It gives enough protection for a normal use, please note if you are in construction business and need a case that will protect the hammer to fall on your iPad and still be ok then probably this is not the one you need to consider.  I give 5 start to this cases and recommend to anyone!!!";If you like Apple Smart Cover, You will definitely like this one!
78;41.0;5.0;10.0;I paid a lot for my IPAD 2 and wanted to make sure I had a nice quality protection item, I was worried that since I didn't pay a lot for the item it was going to be questionable, oh but to my surprise the item came early and was awesome looking, it looks better then the expensive ones, Its leather and I have had it for a while and it looks brand new. I works perfectly and was a snap to put on, its just as easy to remove, I would totally recommend this item to anyone looking for a low cost high quality cover. you won't be disappointed with this.;Awesome
3;42.0;5.0;11.0;"I purchased a leather iPad case as a Christmas present for my mom, and the cheapest price I found at that time was $20, and it was not a ""smart cover"".  In fact, the screen stays on all the time with that other cover.  I was leery about spending $10 on an iPad cover thinking that it was gonna be a piece of junk.  I was pleasantly surprised when it came in the mail today.  It is a nice sturdy cover, and it works like all of the $25-$30 smart covers.  It sleeps when it is closed and wakes when you open it.  I have been having a terrible day, so receiving this in the mail made me feel as though my luck might turn around after all.  I love it.  I am going to buy another one for my mom, since the one I got her for Christmas is not as good.";Inexpensive, definitely not cheap!
36;43.0;5.0;9.0;"I have had a few different covers for the iPad 2 and the ""new"" iPad, and this one is by far the best.  The case is slim, light, protective, and attractive.  I like the fact that with this case you can combine the features of the smart cover and protection for the back of the iPad without losing any of the functionality of the camera, speaker, etc.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone that is in need of a good quality iPad cover at a great price.";Great Cover at a Great Price!
41;44.0;5.0;9.0;"I never leave feedback but in this case I have to. We have over a dozen iPads at my office and I have tried a lot of cases...some costing up to $200.00. This item beats them all hands down. It is slim, not really orange more of a russett tan, shut off feature works perfectly and has a great feel both open and closed. The only problem, which others have also noted, is the smell of this cover when new. I can only describe it as a ""dead fish"" oder but it goes away within a week, so it's not really a long term problem and does not warrant a reduction of a star. Highly recommended and a great price - what more could you ask for. I will be ordering more of these very soon.";Best iPad case ever!
43;45.0;4.0;9.0;This is a nice full coverage case. Even though it is not leather, it's not a cheap imitation. This is my 4th iPad case and so far the best one. I have been trying to find a case that would not add too much extra weight. This isn't the thinnest but it is a nice fit. Snaps in and holds securely. My only issue is that the cover sometimes comes open as with all the smart cover like cases...unless they have an additional fastner or zipper or something to hold it close. I bought the white which does get dirty but  cleans easily with a wipe without ruining (the convenience of not being leather). All in all very nice. Not the lightest, thinnest but nice quality and fit. Only skins and smart cover provide less bulk (but less protection also). fast processing, shipping.;Fits like a glove
51;46.0;3.0;9.0;"UPDATE 1/10/13\nI've had this case for about 10 months now... I am knocking the rating down from 5 star to 3 1/2 stars (even though Amazon doesn't allow 1/2 stars). I still like the look of the case however i am a little disappointed in the durability of the case. The leatherette has peeled away at the corners exposing the plastic beneath. With this protection stripped away the ""clips"" that hold the ipad have started to chip. I still like the case, though I would have liked it to last at least a full year under regular use. It's still a good price, and a color that you don't find with other brands...just know what you are paying for.\n\nORIGINAl REVIEW\nThis is a great value as compared to the smart covers issued by Apple. My 3rd gen Ipad snaps in easily and stays in no problem...fits like a glove. Its nice to have a cover on both the front and back....The sleep-cover issue is now resolved and works great on both my gen3 and my wife's gen2....I am really happy with the quality of my orange cover and the reasonable price.";UPDATE: OK value/ Pretty good product - Great Value for a Great Product
62;47.0;5.0;9.0;"I ordered the older version of this case for my new iPad and the sleep/wake functioning didn't work (that was the ONLY complain back then), and now that I have received my replacement, which works PERFECTLY with the new iPad, not only does it fit perfectly and securely, but also sleeps and wakes up the iPad.\n\nThe case is made of good quality leather, both the front and the back, and provides solid protection.  The front is exactly like the Apple smart cover.  My only complain is that this item weighs about twice that of the Apple smart cover - but then you have a whole ""back"" protection, which the Apple cover doesn't provide.\n\nThe seller is very nice to deal with, always replied to my questions during the exchange into the new model.  Five star for both the product and the seller!";A value packed perfect fit!
68;48.0;5.0;9.0;I got a new iPad when they came out, but I knew I wanted just the right case. At first, I considered the Incipio Lexington. It seemed like the best case to not add too much bulk to the iPad. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately!), it got bad reviews. The iPad feels perfect without a case, so I wanted to keep that same effect. The Invellop case does that! I would recommend it to anyone. I ordered it after they said that the magnet feature was fixed. And it is! The magnets work perfectly for sleep/wake.\n\nMy iPad snapped straight in. Snug fit that does not feel like it will come out by accident. This is the case that Apple should have made a year ago. At first use, I thought the Invellop case made the iPad feel like it was about to tip over in the stand orientation. However, when I tipped it toward its center of balance I could tell you would have to tip the iPad way over before it would fall forward. Another thing I was wary of is if the magnetic case would activate the sleep mode when folded backward. IT DOES NOT! I have read that some cases have that annoying problem. Another handy thing is that when the cover is folded up on itself, it doubles as a grip for taking pictures! You can't go wrong with this case. Sorry if it sounds like I work for the manufacturer.\n\nNow for the look of the case. Beautiful. Great fit and finish. It really feels like it should cost over $50. Nope, it costs half that. Snag this one while it is cheap and available!;Finally, my iPad feels an iPad!
71;49.0;5.0;9.0;I looked through all the cases available for the New iPad... and this one looked perfect.  Got it in the mail, and IT IS PERFECT.  I waited until they fixed the sleep function to order.  Very pleased with the product and how quickly it arrived.  Sleek, slim, but protects the corners.  Easy to prop up.  Camera/speaker/button holes are all great.  VERY HAPPY WITH THIS CASE!!;AWESOME CASE
75;50.0;5.0;9.0;I was looking for a great cover that is flexible and easy to use - I use my Ipad for charting as I am a nurse. So, something that is durable and acts as a smart cover is essential.  I was pleasantly surprised when I received the cover.  It fits great, looks fantastic, durable and easy to use - helps to conserve battery life using the smart cover feature.  I would buy this over and over - will absolutely buy in another color.  Suggested it to all my co-workers, they love the cover and the price!!!;Love this!!!!
32;51.0;5.0;8.0;Bought 2 covers...One for my iPad2 and another for my iPad3...the magnetic sleep/wake function works perfectly on both iPads and the fit is excellent as well...I've tried shaking it and trying to remove it...but it stays on great...definitely would recommend to others;Awesome cover for the iPad2 and iPad3
39;52.0;5.0;8.0;This is my third and last New iPad case for now. Being a Vols fan, I was hoping for a brighter Orange, however, that was not the case. I still like the color so I can live with it. My first case purchase did not work correctly with the magnetic wake/sleep. The second case had a three-fold front that would not magnetically lock into a triangle. This worked OK for landscape but not for portrait.  The INVELLOP case solved both of these issues as well as having a good secure fit for the iPad. Overall it is an excellent case and I have been recommending it to others;Excellent INVELLOP Smart Cover Case
40;53.0;5.0;8.0;Perfect cover...made well, designed well, feels good! Tried several, but this one really does not need any changes or modifications.;"""bulls eye"" cover"
15;54.0;1.0;5.0;It's a nice looking case, but the 4 corners that clip the iPad into place fray easily and eventually the iPad cannot stay in place.  Maybe it's because I'm using an iPad 3rd gen, which because of it's size put more strain on the edges, but nonetheless the fact that once a corner loses its grip, it becomes a matter of time before your iPad will slip out and cannot remain in place.;Bought it twice, breaks easily every time!
45;55.0;2.0;8.0;"I have used this case since the release of the 3rd generation iPad. I find that this case is great for its sleekness and feel.  This case is better than the SmartCover that Apple sells because of the attached protective case on the back.  The SmartCover is basically a ""cover"" without any rear protection to avoid dents and scratches.  Unfortunately, I have found that the magnet within the Invellop case is not strong enough to turn the device on and off from sleep mode. Also, after bending the cover flap consistently to allow the iPad to stand freely, the material on the top and bottom edges of the flap started to wear and peel away. After dropping the iPad within this case, the digitizer (glass front, not LCD) cracked diagonally along the whole screen.  After a month of using this case, 2 corners that kept the iPad secure within the case broke off.  It does not do a great job at protecting the product, but it allows the iPad to retain its thin and sleek design.  The material is not that great. It does not really hold up after 2 months. I wish I had invested in a better case.";Great design, cheap materials
46;56.0;1.0;8.0;It's perfect for my new iPad (3rd Gen). It snaps easily and doesn't fall off. The cover does its job locking and unlocking. the color is slightly bright red but it's still a great cover. I am not regretting this cover at all! Do mind that this is not a thick cover. If you have kids or you need a tough cover, this is not for you. I have kids and I keep this away from them when I'm not looking.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThe corner ends broke easily and the flap doesn't really work after a few weeks. It slides off easily now the corner ends broke. I made repairs but it still won't hold it. I threw it away already. Don't buy.;Great for my New iPad! (Not great anymore after a few weeks)
47;57.0;2.0;8.0;Apparently, unless you complain publicly, this company ignores your email.  I send an email to them, on April 22, describing the problems, and have received zero response.  Not even an acknowledgment of receipt of the email (I had Amazon send me a copy as proof).\n\nMy cover has two problems:\n\n1) The stitching along the spine is crooked, so the cover, when folded backward is crooked.  It is lined up ok when the cover is closed.\n\n2) When the cover is closed, any slight movement in the cover causes the magnets to turn the iPad on and off.  I noticed it when, for example, putting the iPad (with closed cover) down on a table, or handing it to another person.  If the front cover is moved just slightly, the iPad clicks, indicating it turned on and off.  This tells me the magnets are not strong enough.\n\nI have an iPad 3rd generation.\n\nTwo stars.  One star off for each problem above, and another because the company has ignored me.\n\nOne more nit, which doesn't get a star removal:  they put little inspection stickers on the microfiber surface.  Mine had two such stickers:  one on the inside of each of the front and back covers.  These stickers, if removed, leave behind sticky glue on the microfiber.  I used Scotch tape to remove most of it.  Of course any sticky glue left on the microfiber will get it dirty faster in that area, and maybe even leave some glue on your iPad's screen.  Don't try to remove the inspection stickers.  Just ignore them.\n\nIf the problems had been resolved (or if even an attempt had been made to resolve them) I would have written a favorable review.  As it is, I cannot recommend either the cover or the company.;Customer service ignores emails
57;58.0;5.0;8.0;The design is very slim and light weight. The leatherette feels nice and high end.  The iPad clips nicely into the case and protects the back, screen and edges.  The sleep feature works but could use slightly stronger magnets. It sometimes wakes the iPad with just a little movement of the front cover.  Regardless this is a super nice case for a great price.  Very nice job Invellop.;Very nice smart cover case for the new iPad
60;59.0;5.0;8.0;Received the previous version of this case for an iPad 3 and it didn't work so well.  Fit was good, but Sleep/Wake function didn't work, as as been documented in these reviews.  Company offered refund and return shipping for the revised product and the new case works great for iPad 3.  Very nice design.  Form fitting.  Not too bulky while protecting the iPad for daily use.  We love it.  Thanks to INVELLOP for following up and standing behind their product!;Works great and super Customer Service
72;60.0;5.0;8.0;Great cover! I had been looking around for a cover for several weeks hoping I wouldn't have to spend a small fortune to get something good. And I finally found this one! This cover fits well, feels sturdy, has the smart cover feature (which works great with my iPad2) and came at a very reasonable price. Very happy with this purchase.;Great cover!
81;61.0;2.0;8.0;I bought this iPad cover for my iPad 3 and it arrived on time on March 16th. I noticed immediately that the on/off function doesn't work with the new iPad but it wasn't a big deal. Invellop refunded me $6 for the missing function. On the other side it fits the iPad 3 pretty well. After using this cover in the last 2 weeks and in comparison to the original Apple Smart Cover, I realized that this cover is too heavy, and not on the same par with the Smart Cover. For the price I paid (which is $24 after the refund) I don't believe it's worth. It is worth $15 (the original price before they added $11 more when iPad 3 started shipping) but definitely not $24.\n\nUpdate 04/21/2012\n\nI returned the cover to Invellop and bought Apple's leather smart cover. The material is much better, and the cover is more flexible. The Ipad 3 is quite heavy after a while and the heavy Invellop cover can make it worse. Just my two cents!;Not Worth the Price!
82;62.0;2.0;8.0;Well I just got my case, it looks nice,  but it smells like piss. The second part is that the magnet well not covers it. Or will not stay in place I would like to see it be replaced, but I'm having a hard time reaching customer care if somebody knows a way they can help me out. Please respond as soon as possible I would like to replace it and I can't use it, because it smells.;Nice, but smell funny?
85;63.0;5.0;8.0;AMAZING what can I see. The foldable front cover works better than my Apple Ipad smart cover and looks and feels like leather. The inside is soft and plus and adds ample protection. Had an issue with the post office not delivering my package and Invellop customer service was great. Great protection, great product, great company. Will do business in the future. Highly recommend!!;"Amazing Fits ""The New iPad"" like a glove...."
25;64.0;5.0;7.0;I've gone through a couple of iPad 2 covers and cases. None seems to really satisfied my needs until I received the INVELLOP Leatherette Cover. It's not really orange. It's more like a rust colored leatherette. It looks way more expensive that it was. The fit is perfect ( iPad 2 ) and the magnet on/off feature works great.\n\nI would absolutely buy from this company again and would recommend this product to any of my friends with an iPad.\n\nAlso, the item arrived a few days before it was due. Way to go Invellop;Wow. Very nice
102;65.0;5.0;8.0;I highly recommend this case for the iPad. I purchased it in advance of the release of the new iPad after the company assured me that if it didn't fit, they would give a refund. It turns out that it does, in fact, fit perfectly. The case is high quality and looks great. Best of all, the cost is significantly lower than competing products!\n\nIt's worth noting that since the case was made for the iPad 2, the version I purchased did not work with the new iPad's automatic cover on/off feature. It seems that Apple moved the magnets around slightly. When I contacted the company, within minutes they responded, offering me a complete refund or the option to keep the current case until they make new ones that activate the on/off feature. I was very impressed with the customer service.\n\nAll in all, if you have an iPad 2, this is a great choice for a case. If you have the new iPad, wait until they've come out with a new version and you'll be very happy with what you get.\n\nPS\n\nI don't work for the company! I'm just pleased to get a quality item at an affordable price.;Great case for a low price
17;66.0;5.0;6.0;"I vascillated between purchasing the burnt orange color of this case or the dark magenta case.  I got the dark magenta.  I couldn't be more pleased.  The case is very well made.  It works perfectly.  My iPad3 fits very snugly in the case; I know it won't fall out.  The on/off feature works perfectly.  The case forms a triangular base to prop the iPad up on it and this feature works just as it should.  As others have said, the craftsmanship is high quality.  The color is a bit more muted than it showed on my monitor, but it is gorgeous.  A lovely, sophisticated dark pink color.  The only thing I don't like about it--and this would be true with any case--is that it adds a bit more heft to the iPad, making it heavier than it was before.  It's a little bit harder for me to hold it in portrait mode with one hand.  But I have small hands, so others might not have this issue.  I'll probably buy the burnt orange one as well and swap them out from time to time.";Fantastic product
16;67.0;1.0;5.0;I got this two months ago. The corners are peeling off and there is only plastic now. I emailed the company and heard nothing back from them. I am very disappointed with this cover. I will not get this brand ever again. It is a big disappointment that they did not respond to my emails.;Bad
38;68.0;5.0;7.0;l bought three of different cover since I've got my new IPad, so far this is my favorite. It is light weight and it protects my iPad at the same time. The others I had is great but is either too bulky or heavy. This one is the best choice for me as for carry around my bag to work or play everyday.;Good product
42;69.0;2.0;7.0;"I have to echo some of the other reviewers here. I love the design of the case, the sleekness, etc., but I'm really disappointed the smart cover only works 50/50 on the new iPad.\n\nI thought maybe I received an older model (I ordered on 4/18/12) before the initial problems and incompatibility with the new iPad had been ""fixed"".\n\nI tried emailing them to find out if my experience was typical behavior for the ""new and improved"" fully iPad 3 compatible model -- but no acknowledgement or response from the company regarding the problems I am experiencing.";Mixed, wanted to love it
112;70.0;5.0;8.0;Being one of the cheapest dual sided cases, I was iffy about this product. But I'm surprised as to how great the quality is. It's very sturdy, and the kickstand is great even when the iPad is standing vertically. The inside is soft to keep the screen clean, and the sleep/wake feature works well. So far I'm very happy with this product.;Great product!
55;71.0;5.0;7.0;This is the first time I write a review for anything on Amazon. I bought the Invellop Red leatherette case for my Ipad 3 (the new Ipad) and I must say that this product exceeds my expectations. I used to have the apple original smart cover before this one, and for half the price this is by far a better product than the one I had. First of all, I want to point out that I ordered the product and it arrived in only 3 days via standard shipping so I am VERY pleased with that. As for the case, it is very well designed and constructed. The cover looks and feels like leather (although it is fake leather) and it fits the Ipad 3 perfectly. The smart cover works as promised for the new Ipad and it offers both the landscape mode and the typing mode just like the original/pricier one. The back cover feels strong enough to withstand small impacts, so I am sure my Ipad will be safe at all times. The magnets seem to work well, although it won't stick to the back of the case completely when you carry the ipad like a book, something the Apple smart cover would do (not a big issue). I did seem to notice that sometimes when I closed the case, the Ipad would start randomly clicking on and off due to the case not closing entirely in place... This worries me a bit but I don't think its a huge deal breaker since most of the time the smart cover works fine.\n\nTo sum it all up, this case is probably one if the best cases for Ipad out there. I am very pleased with my purchase and I will definetely recommend this to others. For a decent price you get a great product. My only regret is not having know earlier since I wasted my money on the pricy apple cover. If you are looking for cases like I was and don't know which one to buy, don't look any further, THIS is the case for you!!;AMAZING PRODUCT!!
58;72.0;5.0;7.0;"This is surprisingly better than expected!  The quality of the cover is great, the color is nice and it fits PERFECTLY on your iPad 3 (the new iPad HD).  The ""smart cover"" function on this case DOES WORK as described.  It wakes and sleeps the new iPad without any problems.  This is also one of the few cases that also protects the BACK of the iPad as well.\n\nI'm having a hard time finding anything wrong with this cover.  The only thing I might think would make the case better is if the magnets held the cover to the back when the front part is folded over the back (like a book).";even better than a smart cover, half the price
64;73.0;5.0;7.0;This cover fits great on my new Ipad 3rd generation.  Just snaps in place and is very secure and adds little weight to Ipad.

74;74.0;5.0;7.0;This seller is amazing. Great service, fast shipping and high quality product. This cover was a gift because I was so satisfied with the original one I purchased for myself.

Great job Invellop!!!!;Super High Quality
22;75.0;3.0;6.0;This is a decent iPad cover (fits the iPad 3), but it is not as sturdy as the Snugg cover.  The Invellop holds the iPad only at the corners (instead of a secure sleeve).  The cover can be folded in several ways to change viewing angle, but is not overly sturdy (it does hold it acceptably, but doesn't provide that assurance).  Also, I've experienced the iPad turning on and off repeatedly when the cover is closed and I'm moving the case (the magnetic cover feature may not be optimally aligned, so the iPad senses the cover being opened and closed, even though it is closed.  None of these complaints are deal breakers, but the cover could be better designed.  The color, however, was exactly as envisioned.;"Good iPad Cover; Expected More for the Price"
76;76.0;5.0;7.0;The case is very slim and well built. The auto-on feature works on the case that I received after Invellop posted that the new cases would work with the new iPad. Replaced my other case which was one of the most popular on amazon. This case is definitely thinner and more sleek looking, while still offering good protection.;Works with new iPad.
93;77.0;5.0;7.0;ok so I never never never write reviews. but here we go: I am just loving my new iPad 2 and I must say I could not enjoy it as much as I do without this orange cover. I am so pleased with its functionality, color, and style. Quality is superb and especially for the price. I will be recommending this brand to many friends of mine. I will soon also be ordering an iPhone case from these guys as well. And I can't wait to see if/when their brown iPad 2 case becomes available. Anyhow, thanks again Invellop!;Amazingness...so HAPPY
99;78.0;2.0;7.0;"First, let me say that I do not own this cover, so this isn't a firsthand review of it.\n\nHowever, having seen so many negative reviews, and having been looking for a case for my new iPad3, I did a little research and found this article.\n[...]\n\n""MacOtakara also reported that Apple has made changes to the magnetic sensor that interacts with the Smart Cover to put the new iPad to sleep, though Apple's own Smart Covers still work with the device.\n\n""However, since the position or sensitivity of magnetic sensor was changed, 3rd party's cover which has magnetic sleeping feature may not work perfectly,"" the report read.\n\nDanbo pointed out that Apple has yet to outline the changes in its ""Dimensional Drawings"" resource on its developer website, so case makers will have to do their own research to identify the exact nature of the changes.""\n\nSo, to summarize, most, if not all, third-party ""smart"" covers that worked with iPad2, will NOT work with iPad3 because Apple changed the magnetic sensors.\n\nHope this helps save people some agony.\n\nNote:  Another reviewer received an email from the manufacturer stating that they would basically swap the existing cover for the new and improved cover that will work with the iPad3 in a ""couple weeks.""  So if you really like the case and haven't purchased one yet, it seems an updated version is in the works, so keep on the lookout.";Current case NOT compatible with iPad3
26;79.0;5.0;6.0;I bought this cover one month ago. After using for a while, I find it is a good product. Function well, Looks beautiful. The smart cover works great. And also you can make it stand when you watch movies(First, I thought it cannot stand well. But after one week or so, I found it is just my mistake.)\n\nThus, I recommand this to those who want a case for your ipad2.;Good product
28;80.0;5.0;6.0;The iPad just snaps right in with no fuss, stays secure. The case is extremely light weight, with a tasteful light gray felt-like interior to protect the screen. The iPad locks when you close the cover and unlocks when you open. Beautiful. The cover rolls into a triangle wedge to keep the iPad slightly tilted for desktop use. The holes in the back and sides for the headphone jack, camera, volume controls etc. fit precisely and look elegant.\n\nThe color looks just like the photo, a tasteful burnt orange. Highly recommend this case, and it is fairly priced as it looks very expensive. Wish this company made Kindle covers!;Beautiful case, works as advertised
35;81.0;5.0;6.0;I originally bought this product BEFORE my iPad 3 was delivered. As some negative reviews here mentioned, it did not work with the iPad 3 because Apple has moved the location of magnetic sensor in the new iPad. INVELLOP was fairly quick in responding to my contact, and send out a solution to either refund/exchange for an updated new case. If I remember right, the new case was announced about a week after the iPad 3 was available, with a black color. And then after another week all other colors are available so I shipped back mine, and exchange for a new one. The seller promised refund of the shipping cost, but I have not check where did that refund went since it's just a few dollars. Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with how the company deals with unforeseen circumstances and try their best to make their customers happy.\n\nNow the product itself is actually very good as well. After the update the magnetic cover works as advertised: when you close it, it locks the iPad and you can hear the lock sound to confirm the lock. It didn't add much bulk and weight to the iPad, while protecting everything else only leaving all ports accessible. The materials has a high quality finish and feels good when you touch it. Just like the Apple flip cover the front kind of rolls up into a triangle so you can put it up for viewing video or have a slant angle for typing.\n\nOverall, I am very happy with the case so far. Although there is some initial issue with the original product not working with the iPad 3, it really wasn't INVELLOP's fault, so I think they handle it pretty well.  I recommend this case.;Happy with the case and INVELLOP customer service
37;82.0;5.0;6.0;This is really a very pretty case and works for my iPad3 perfectly (sleep/wake function works, too.) It's a snug fit and doesn't add any bulk to the iPad. Beautiful rusty orange color. Front cover folds complete flat over the back cover when opened.\nPS: If you are a 2nd generation Kindle owner and have the case made by Amazon (like this one http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Leather-Cover-Display-Generation/dp/B002Y27P6O ), this iPad case is very similar to the Amazon kindle case. You will love it.;Beautiful case!
44;83.0;5.0;6.0;This is my second case for my iPad and I must admit I was a bit skeptical when I placed the order and was ready to hit the return to send button. I was pleasantly surprised at how well this case is and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an iPad case;Thumbs Up!
18;84.0;1.0;5.0;Although this cover looks very attractive, after a few months of use it no longer holds my New iPad securely and it is fraying along the edges.  Also, this cover does not support the new IPad's different magnet system to turn the iPad off when the cover is closed.;Disappointing Quality
50;85.0;5.0;6.0;This product delivers as advertised. It was really simple to snap my iPad into. I was initially concerned about the sleep/wake feature not working with the new iPad but the smart cover feature works flawlessly. I haven't had it for very long but it seems to be a good value for the price.;As advertised
52;86.0;5.0;6.0;"I got the case for my ""new"" iPad.  Slim, light, and attractive. Easy to hold and protects the whole iPad.\n\nThe original purchase was a case that did not turn the iPad on and off automatically.  The company replaced the case and refunded my shipping costs.  WOW!";Great Case
63;87.0;5.0;6.0;I just received by Invellop case in the mail today to replace a KHOMO DUAL CASE which did not successfully operate the auto on/off feature of the New iPad (3). There is a world of difference in the two cases. While the Khomo case did fit the back exceptionally well, it was very thin plastic which could be easily broken when installing or removing and the folding cover was very stiff and didn't stay put when folded back.\n\nThe Invellop case, on the other hand, is made from a high quality material with a textured feel which snaps on very snuggly at all four corners and has a soft felt liner. The folding screen cover is also higher quality and has the same felt liner and textured feel on the outside. Oh, and it works the auto on/off feature like a charm. Well worth the extra $4 I paid and far less than the Apple cover which does not cover the back at all.;Excellent case at an excellent price
77;88.0;5.0;6.0;I love the INVELLOP ipad case! It looks great, it works great! It covers both the back and the front of my ipad and its a perfect fit, slim, and I love the color! I din't expect to get such a great product for such a low price and I enjoy using it very much. I also ordered the black color for my brother's ipad and he is absolutely loving it. The best purchase I've done and satisfied 100% :);INVELLOP
87;89.0;1.0;6.0;This case is in line with Apple's minimalistic  approach, however it is falsely advertised. The case in the description does not have a cheesey metal logo like mine and the description stated that the magnetic sleep/wake function would work with the New Ipad but it doesn't. I purchased this product before March 16, 2012. I have now learned that they have changed the description of the product after all of the negative complaints. Not to mention the price went up prior to the release of the New Ipad. This company has shady business practices and I will no longer be dealing with them. I would give this case as a gift...to an enemy.  With that said...BUYER BEWARE.;Fits New Ipad but....
21;90.0;5.0;5.0;"Purchased this smart case for the wife's iPad 3. Seems well-constructed and fits snug at all four corners. ""Smart"" functionality works just as expected.  Leatherette is nice. Great value as compared to the comparable product in the Apple store at a savings of 40%-50%.";Looks good, well-constructed, great value!
89;91.0;2.0;6.0;"The model I received has two issues.\n\n1) the sleep function does not work on my New iPad -- apparently the polarization of the magnet is incorrect in the cover I received.\n2) instead of an embossed ""invellop"" on the cover, there is a metallic nondescript logo affixed to the front cover. Just the sort of thing that would scratch the case of my MacBook in my briefcase.\n\nGoing to request a return I guess.";New iPad sleep function doesn't work
92;92.0;2.0;6.0;"I just received the case today. It is a good quality case. It fits my 3rd gen iPad well. However it is not a ""Smart Cover case for 'The New iPad'"" as they advertised. They now say that they will not exchange it for a new one with proper magnets because they made changes in the ""technical details."" I know they changed the product name and the descriptions more than once since I bought it. When I bought it, the name still said ""Smart Cover case for the New iPad."" Well, it is not a Smart Cover case at all. The name is misleading. If you are thinking about buying it because you think it is a ""Smart Cover case,"" don't buy it. Other reviewers said they would exchange it for a new one. I just heard from them. They said they will not exchange it. It seems like the product name and details are not the only things they keep changing. I wish they would stop calling it a ""Smart Cover case"" for the new iPad.";Not a Smart Cover Case
23;93.0;5.0;5.0;"Hi, you can see the review I wrote for the Invellop case here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/INVELLOP-ORANGE-Leatherette-Cover-Case-for-iPad-2-iPad-3-The-New-iPad-Built-in-magnet-for-sleep-wake-feature/dp/B0078UYW2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">INVELLOP ORANGE Leatherette Cover Case for iPad 2 / iPad 3 / The New iPad (Built-in magnet for sleep/wake feature)</a>.\n\nI ordered the gray case at roughly the same time as I ordered the one in orange, figuring that I would just like to see both to compare. The gray cover is very light (a bit lighter than the picture of it online) and it had the slightest sheen to it; I'd call the color ""silver"" rather than ""gray."" Sorry to split hairs, but I think the difference is an important one for customers. I ended up returning the gray and keeping the orange, which is matte.\n\nI'd love to underline the fact that this is the best shipping experience I've ever had with Amazon, all of which have been good!! But this is really THE best. This vendor really understands customer service inside and out.";Great cover/case, outstanding service.
101;94.0;4.0;6.0;"Bought this case before i received the ""new"" iPad because in the title it says that it is for the third generation. Although the case fits perfect, the smart cover feature does not work, its not that big of a deal but i was still looking forward to using this feature. I do recommend this case, but just beware of the smart cover not working properly.";Great Case but smart cover feature doesnt work with the new iPad
30;95.0;2.0;5.0;"Let's cut straight to the chase:\n\nPros:\n\n- Came a day early (May 30 2012)\n- Works as advertised, meaning it fits the newest generation iPad, the smart cover will stay closed even when turned upside down, and the automatic on/off lid option works perfectly as described.\n\nPROBLEMS:\n\n- First of all, there was a red/pinkish stain in the lower right area of the front smart cover that I immediately noticed as I was pulling it out of the white box it came in. It looks like either a dripped juice stain, or a marker stain. Unacceptable for a ""new"" (I'll get to that in a moment) product, but that's up to you.\n\n- There were multiple ""brownish"" stains across the edges of the case. Not immediately noticeable, but it looked like something you bought second-hand from a garage sale.\n\n- It is heavily scented (not a bad smell, but not normal when you buy these types of things), and powdery. I'm talking like, actual powder coming off the back of the smart cover, and leaving residue from the case onto the screen of my iPad. That is not normal, and quite frankly felt nasty.\n\n- Poor craftsmanship. Look closely around the edges of the molding of the back cover case and you'll see some very amateurish work. The edges of the case look like ""melted ice cream."" Quite frankly, it looks like someone molded it at home, it doesn't even look like it was manufactured at a real factory. $25 is just enough price-wise for me to find this unacceptable.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI was very unsatisfied, and have requested a refund, and I will ship it back to Amazon (or wherever) tomorrow. True story, I immediately drove out to the Best Buy (I had just bought the iPad, waited for this case, and could not wait any longer) and bought a Incase Magazine Jacket case, which I now love. I paid $50 bucks for it, but hey, at least I got a powder-free case, that doesn't smell awkward (for a case), and it actually is professionally made.";Could have been great, but will be returned. I wouldn't buy.
31;96.0;5.0;5.0;This is cheap and good. The material looks a little dull, but overall I am completely satisfied with this product. Very practical. Highly recommended if you are looking for a cover to protect your iPad but do not want your iPad to be any bulkier than necessary.;excellent super thin cover
0;97.0;5.0;6.0;I been using it since febr, got it for my birthday. And i love it. It is the best so far. It has the smart cover option. And its just feels so comfortable in your hands, very slik, not bulky at all. Very precisely made. If you thinking buying it just buy it. I garranty you will love it.\n\nAnd this is the only place to buy it, won't find anywhere else.;Love it Envellop
33;98.0;5.0;5.0;I am glad that I purchased this case. It fits my iPad 2 perfectly, the sleep/wake feature works just fine, and the color is perfect! (It might seem strange, but I'm very particular about my pink accessories.)\n\nAll in all, I'm very pleased because I was not going to travel with my iPad without suitable protection.;In love
34;99.0;5.0;5.0;Like others, I can't believe I'm writing a review for an iPad case - but I am!! I did my due dilligence - and researched for a few weeks and finally pulled the trigger on this.\nTHIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME.\nIt's everything I wanted - works perfectly, doesn't add bulk at all - and I could not be happier. Don't doubt this for one second! I even bought one for my girlfriend in red - and she loves it too. Great product and company - just get it!;Ecstatic! After a month of research!
48;100.0;5.0;5.0;The case's smart features now works with the new iPad! I had an original one that didn't work but was given a free exchange at no cost.  Invellop was really easy to work with.  It is a little sensitive and needs to be completely on the right side to turn off. It would be nice if it would turn off when it is mostly on the right side.  However it works and does a good job.\n\nOverall I really like the case.  The quality is excellent and I really like how the back is hard and protects the iPad. I've played with the smart cover and think this one is a lot better.;Works Great with the iPad gen 3
54;101.0;5.0;5.0;This is the first time I write a review for anything on Amazon. I bought the RED Invellop leatherette case for my Ipad 3 (the new Ipad) and I must say that this product exceeds my expectations. I used to have the apple original smart cover before this one, and for half the price this is by far a better product than the one I had. First of all, I want to point out that I ordered the product and it arrived in only 3 days via standard shipping so I am VERY pleased with that. As for the case, it is very well designed and constructed. The cover looks and feels like leather (although it is fake leather) and it fits the Ipad 3 perfectly. The smart cover works as promised for the new Ipad and it offers both the landscape mode and the typing mode just like the original/pricier one. The back cover feels strong enough to withstand small impacts, so I am sure my Ipad will be safe at all times. The magnets seem to work well, although it won't stick to the back of the case completely when you carry the ipad like a book, something the Apple smart cover would do (not a big issue). I did seem to notice that sometimes when I closed the case, the Ipad would start randomly clicking on and off due to the case not closing entirely in place... This worries me a bit but I don't think its a huge deal breaker since most of the time the smart cover works fine.\n\nTo sum it all up, this case is probably one if the best cases for Ipad out there. I am very pleased with my purchase and I will definetely recommend this to others. For a decent price you get a great product. My only regret is not having know earlier since I wasted my money on the pricy apple cover. If you are looking for cases like I was and don't know which one to buy, don't look any further, THIS is the case for you!!;AMAZING PRODUCT!!
59;102.0;3.0;5.0;I got this case for my new ipad3 after reading the raving reviews, but I wasn't that impressed. It was thin, the cover is not strong enough to hold the iPad in an angle for viewing or typing and another disappointment is that the sleep/wake function doesnt work the the new iPad. I returned this product and the seller was very prompt in responding to my email and I am waiting for the refund. I just wish the description was more accurate so I could have avoided the hassle of returning.;Thin case, sleep/wake function doesn't work for the new iPad, had to return it
65;103.0;5.0;5.0;I love the design of this case, its very light, adds very little bulk, holds the ipad very securely and all the cut outs are perfectly placed.  The soft cloth of the foldable cover provides a convenient way of cleaning the screen.  The stitching is perfect, I feel this case will last forever, its a quality product.\n\nI got one of the first cases that did not work with the sleep/wake feature on the iPad 3 - thanks to Apple's secret changes, which screwed over all third party case manufacturers.  As other reviewers have said, Invellop went the extra mile of not just offering a simple refund or exchange, but all kinds of options to meet everybody's needs. I elected to send back my case and get a replacement.  They refunded the shipping and sent a new case out to me the day they received my old case.  It took just 5 business days from sending my old case to receiving my new one.  I couldn't be happier with their customer service!;Excellent fit and finish, awesome company
80;104.0;4.0;5.0;This is a nice case and fits nicely with my new iPad 3.  The seller changed the product description as when I tried it out with my freshly purchased iPad, the Smart Cover case did not work as when advertised.\nI sent a few emails though Amazon's system about my issue and they have not yet replied.  So boo to their customer service for first selling this as a Smart Cover for iPad 3, then by not responding to any of my issues and requests via the Amazon system.\n\nedit 4/2/2012:\nInvellop came back with some CS and advised that I could send back for updated cover or receive $6 back on the cover.\nI have updated my rating to reflect this.;Advertised as a working Smart Cover for new iPad 3 when purchased
83;105.0;1.0;5.0;"Like others have written already, it will not work witty the sleep/wake feature of the new iPad. This has already been covered in the description now and I can't not ding them for that. What does not seat well with me, is that they did not send me an ""invellop"" case, but instead a ""Jisoncase"". I'm not sure if they are the same company, as of now I'm thinking they are, seeing how all their products are the same except for the badging. With that said, I can't stand the jisoncase badging. I also feel mislead by the whole event and find the whole event a little shady.\n\nThe case itself does fit nicely, but can't say I like the red for this case. It's not as deep of a red as the apple smart cover, so just be aware of that before purchasing. I was also hoping that they would let me exchange it in two weeks for one that does work full with the iPad 3, but that option was not offered. The good news is they are letting me return it. The bad news is I just lost about 12 bucks on shipping and have no case. (half the cost of the actual case mind you.)\n\nI can not recommend this company's product simply for the shady business practices alone, as it has just left me bitter.";Not an invellop case. Shady business practices
84;106.0;4.0;5.0;This is a very nice expensive looking case. I would give it 4.5 stars (on an ipad i couldn't get it to go to 4.5) because I would have preferred it if, when one folds it, the leather rather than the suede met the surface. If ur surface has dust or a mess of any kind then it would be easier to clean if it met the leather (a little particular, I know) but I'm a bit of a clean freak!\nAlso, the orange is a very nice burnt orange.;4.5 stars: very nice but...
90;107.0;5.0;5.0;first off, let me just say that i've loved this case ever since i received it on the same day i got my 3rd gen iPad. the stitching seems to be very strong and the soft microfiber material on the inside help protect the ipad perfectly from outside scratches.  in addition, the color is  a rust orange and i've gotten compliments on it since it is not loud and bright, its subtle.  i've used this case both laying down typing and upright watching a movie, the case makes both stances very stable and i've even been able to type comfortably while it is standing up as well. though not adjustable, both heights are very comfortable.  Even if i initially knew It didn't have the sleep/wake function on the new iPad, i think i would've still bought this case regardless since, don't most of us have unlock passwords on our ipad anyway? With respect to the manufacturer's earlier description, i'm pretty sure they would not have said it had the sleep/wake feature unless they truly thought it did. i place more blame on Apple since most of their earlier smart covers do not work with the new iPad either.  All in all, im happy with the purchase and have no regrets after my intense 2 week researching for a thin, attractive, durable case.;Still the best case for the iPad...if you don't sweat the small stuff.
91;108.0;5.0;5.0;*Updated Review* Someone from customer service e-mailed me today to notify me that they updated the case to work with the iPad 3 and that I am able to exchange my current case for the new one. I am very pleased with their customer service and also with the quality of the case. I would and have recommended this case to my friends and family.\n\nI just received my case in the mail. I have the new iPad 3. While the case looks nice and seems like good quality I am disappointed  with my purchase. The main function that I wanted my case to have is the sleep/awake function with the magnetic close. Those functions don't work on the new iPad 3 at all. When I e-mailed the manufacturer about this problem they said the only thing they could do to help is return my case...;Updated review
94;109.0;3.0;5.0;"Update 4/11/12 -\n\nI received my replacement case, and the sleep/awake on the new case does work. However, the underside of the smart cover portion has two problems. First, there is a small defect where it is missing the soft, grey material. Second, there was an ""inspection"" sticker on it that I had to remove, and when I did, it left a sticky residue that doesn't come off. I was hoping that after all of these problems you INVELLOP would make sure that they are sending a quality product to their customers. We'll see how long it takes them to credit my account now that I shipped back the original defective case.\n\nFor new purchasers looking to buy, I would give the case four stars. (I am giving it three in my updated review because of all of the problems I have had and the defects on mine.) I would definitely get this versus just a smart cover as this covers the back as well. My iPad3 snaps into it perfectly, and it looks very nice. Also, the big, metal logo is gone and it now looks like the photo. However, the magnets are quite weak, and the thin binding edge causes the cover to slip around at times.\n\n**********************************\nUpdate 4/2/12 -\n\nI received notification from INVELLOP that their new case, with working sleep/awake function, is now available. Following their directions, I have ordered a new case, and then will return the old one for a refund. Their other option was to return my current case and they would send me the new version, but then my iPad would be unprotected in the meantime. Hopefully the new case works, and their return/refund process goes smoothly. I will update again once I receive the new case.\n\n**********************************\nThis case is falsely listed as working with the New iPad (""iPad3""). The magnets are not set up appropriately so the sleep/awake feature does not work. This information has now been added to INVELLOP's description, but it was not there when I purchased it. Other reviewers say they have heard from INVELLOP, and they have stated they are working on a new case that will function correctly with the New iPad. However, right now, I would not recommend this case for anyone who intends to use it with the New iPad. I am stuck with a non-functioning case. If INVELLOP releases a new case that does work and sends me one at no charge as a replacement, I will review that case and consider updating my review. Also, the cover of mine does not look like the photo. Instead of being all black, it has a big, metal piece attached to the lower right corner. Not sure if it is supposed to be a logo or what, but it really takes away from the sleek look of the cover.";New version of case now fits iPad3 and looks very nice.
96;110.0;5.0;5.0;I originally reviewed this as a 2 star because they sent a case that was compatible with iPad 2, not so much the iPad 3 as advertised. However, I am very impressed by their outreach and the fact that they cared enough to make it right...something other sellers don't really do these days. This company isn't compelled to take the money and run, and they have earned my repeat business going forward as a result.\n\nThis case is actually rather spectacular, very sturdy quality. Add it's affordability and the seller's stellar service, and this is a 5 star product and a 5 star experience.\n\nIn summary, if you're looking for something like a smart cover for your shiny new iPad that also protects the back (unlike Apple's own cover) at a reasonable price (you just spent over $500, protect that thing), then this is the case for you.;Excellent customer service
98;111.0;1.0;5.0;"I have to echo some of the other reviews. I like the product, it is a nice color and if it worked it would be a great cover for a good price. But.......it fits the iPad 3 but it does not sleep and wake the iPad. This may work on the iPad 2 but not on the iPad 3 as stated in the description. They took the full time to ship the product after receiving the order, When I finally got my shipping notice it indicated that it was estimated to arrive in 6 business days. When I emailed them asking from where they had shipped it and how it was shipped...I got a curt reply that did not answer any of my questions and only told me that the 6 business days shipping was the longest it should take. I also questioned the $4.99 shipping as their shipping rates states that the ""expedited shipping"" is $4.99 and they said that the $4.99 was not for expedited shipping but what they were charging to ship the iPad cover.\n\nGo elsewhere for your cover for the new iPad 3.";Not for iPad 3 and curt service
107;112.0;2.0;5.0;Make sure to read the fine print (which was added after I ordered my case unfortunately) as the sleep function does not work on the iPad for this case.  Otherwise a nicely designed case which offers good protection for the iPad. Hopefully, the designer for this case can fix the one flaw regarding the screen wake/sleep function of this case.;iPad 3 sleep function broken
111;113.0;4.0;5.0;I wouldn't have chosen the color, but the product seems to be of adequate quality. If you didn't know better, you might think that it was actually low grade leather.\n\nThe fit on the Ipad2 casing is good. Its tight, at first I thought that it didn't quite fit(as another reviewer stated). However, I used just a little more pressure and the final corner snapped in, and the back case was snug and firmly attached.\n\nMy only gripe is the front cover. It covers well, it folds up and acts as a stand, all of that. I cant speak to how durable it is yet, but it appears to be well made. However, the magnets that hold it on are a little bit on the weak side, just a little bit less than the OEM smart covers. How often will you be holding it upside down, while carefully holding only the edge, to have the magnets not quite hold and the cover flip open? Probably never unless you are a nitpicky person like myself.;Good product. Just a slight bit of magnetism from great

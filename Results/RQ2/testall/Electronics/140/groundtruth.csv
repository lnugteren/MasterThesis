6;1.0;5.0;586.0;I am fairly new to SW radios. I bought a Grunding S350 and was annoyed with the drift . I would tune into a station and it would slowly tune out. I returned it and bought a Grunding YB400PE. It was much better that S350 but the SSB performance was dismal. Also I just could not lock on to some weak signals or to a station that was very close to a more powerful station.\n I went in for the sony 7600GR and have been very happy. The synchronous detection helps a lot. You can select between LSB and USB when doing synchronous detection. This helps you with those pesky neighbouring stations. If it is on the Lower freq. choose USB and vice versa.\n The audio quality is a little inferior to the YB400. It also does not have a handy snooze button. But I am yet to meet a person who buys SW radios for audio quality or as an alarm clock.\n The YB400 comes with a AC mains power adapter but the sony does not. The Reel antenna is included in both.\n  If you are looking for a radio that can tune into weak signals ,provide SSB functionality , synchronous detection , variable attenuation to drown out noisy interference then this is the adio for you. A keeper.;Very good  Radio
122;2.0;5.0;455.0;"For many reasons this is absolutely the best valued shortwave receiver on the market.\n\n1. Synchronous detector!  It enables the radio to lock\n\nonto signals with tenacity.  It reduces fading and noise and\n\nenables you to eliminate interference by selecting a sideband\n\non the other side of the interfering signal.  On the SW7600GR\n\nit works very well.  No other radio at this price has sync\n\ndetector.\n\n2. Build quality.  Made in Japan.  The radio even feels\n\nrobust.  It is.\n\n3. Sensitivity.\n\n4. Great portability.\n\nOf course there are also some liabilities.\n\nSound through the little speaker is not as good as some\n\ncompeting products.  But given that this little Sony blows\n\nthe competitors away in almost all other respects,\n\nthis is a minor quibble.  The sound isn't bad; it just\n\nisn't room filling.  As a personal radio this isn't such\n\na liability.  Plus, you can always use earphones or connect\n\nto auxiliary speakers (Cambridge Soundworks?).\n\nThe memory system is simple, without alphabetic labels.\n\nThere is no tuning dial, just jog buttons for scanning\n\nthe bands.  Simplicity makes for easy operation, though.\n\nFM reception is respectable (much better than the very\n\nexpensive big brother the Sony ICF-SW77).  Standard AM\n\nreception is good, possibly very good.  But if you are\n\ninterested in DXing the AM bands, you already have a\n\nGE Super Radio.\n\nIt doesn't have an AC adaptor (and you should AVOID buying\n\nthe horrible--and horribly expensive--official Sony adaptor).\n\nIf you want to power from AC, get an inexpensive one.  I power\n\nmine with rechargeable NiMH batteries which work better than\n\nalkalines and can be reused hundreds of times.  Buy two\n\nsets of batteries and you'll always have a set charged and\n\nready to go.  Battery drain is respectively low and the unit\n\nfunctions perfectly on the slightly lower voltage NiMHs.\n\nAs a travel radio, or as an introduction to shortwave, I can't\n\nthink of a better unit.  Probably the best recommendation for\n\nthe 7600GR is that in spite of all the laudable reviews, using\n\none for the first time still surprises.  Originally priced\n\nat just under $200 US, current street prices make this an\n\nincredible value.\n\nNow for the bad news.  Sony is getting out of the world band\n\nradio business.  These little gems may soon be unavailable.\n\nSo if you're interested in the 7600GR, now is the time.";Best Value -- Get one while you can
8;3.0;5.0;6.0;"This is a terrific little portable radio and I love it. I needed SSB mode for ham work and that's getting hard to find in a quality built ""pocket"" radio, which this definitely is. It's made in Japan and feels like a brick (in the good sense) just like the portable Sonys I had forty years ago. The digital tuning doesn't bother me and the BFO more than covers that for CW and SSB. I love having 100 memories, since mine is getting rather shaky :-). There is ONE THING you must know about this radio, or any other portable shortwave radio for that matter: If you buy it for anything more than local broadcasts or strong shortwave stations, plan to build or buy an adequate antenna. The built-in antennas and the included roll-up antenna are OK for strong stations, but to really pull in signal you will need something better. I carry thirty meters of long wire that I clip to the whip and throw in a tree, it works great. All in all, a wonderful little receiver, really glad I snapped one up before they're gone. Cheers!";Get one while you can!
92;4.0;5.0;348.0;"It's unclear when it all began - somewhere in the last couple of decades, the quality worldband radio receiver slowly faded away. The great names on the shortwave units of yesteryear are now either slapping their badges on drugstore-discount South Asian made devices, or have stopped making radios altogether. The solid metal, the dials and switches, the detailed engineering, all drifted away and replaced with toy-grade plastic, fewer features, and ""let's see how cheap we can build it"" design. With the exception of one -\n\nAt first glance, you know right away that the made-in-Japan Sony ICF-SW7600GR is definitely not available at your corner shoppe, much less your local electronics store - the interface consists of 27 buttons, 5 switches, and 3 knobs. There are two clocks and two alarms. There's two output jacks (headphone, line out) right next to the antenna jack. The whip antenna is nearly a full yard in length. Serious, indeed. But as intimidating as it all seems at first, the flowchart-logical layout is very efficient, and anyone who's ever wished their radio had something more than just a Stereo-Mono switch to get a weak signal is accommodated in more ways than one.\n\nThe seriousness continues when you pick up the 7600GR. Though it's considered a ""coat pocket"" portable, it feels as though it's filled with concrete or perhaps lead shot. If weight is a sign of quality, the 7600GR makes itself unabashedly clear, weighing in at just over 15 iPod Nanos (1 and 1/3 pounds). The positive-click buttons would be at home in a luxury car, the knobs turn smoothly, and switches move confidently into position. Nothing is loose or rattles, everything is buttoned-down and solid. You could say it feels German, but they stopped making portable radios long ago...\n\nYet all the forethought and engineering that went into the exterior is just the prelude to what's on the inside. This would still be a top-tier portable just on it's receiver components alone, but Sony goes a step further, piling on the professional tuning features (one of which, the Synchronous Detector, is not found on portables from any other manufacturer). The 7600GR is a veritable box of solutions to the all-too-common radio reception problems; the ""This weak station is being drowned out by a powerful station"" problem, the ""This station is almost clear except for a weak station in the background"" problem, the ""How can I get rid of this high-pitched interference"" problem, etc. Without getting too technical, this is a very sensitive receiver on its own, and should reception fall short, there's a barrage of trick electronic tuning tools to try out.\n\nOf course no radio is perfect, and the 7600GR isn't immune. There's no knob for tuning, which is all done by buttons. The case is too small for high-fidelity sound from the speaker. The backlight is for the display only, not the buttons. But this is all nitpicking in light of pure tuner power; You won't miss the tuning knob when you get that one near-impossible station that no other radio you've tried can get.\n\nIf you browse around the internet for 7600GR reviews from experienced radio technicians, you'll find that they essentially come in two categories: the first is ""I kept having problem x with radio y, so I just went and got a 7600GR"" and the second is ""I spent more on my radio rig than I did my car, so when I needed a portable I got a 7600GR."" There aren't any lengthy tirades about technical issues or design failures, just page after page of happy owners, sharing their techniques and experiences. Another Amazon reviewer noted that the Sony is the ""Best shortwave radio under $200"", but this is really selling it short - portable shortwave radios only go up to about $200, and (not counting used units) there aren't any more until you reach the very technical world of tabletop receivers starting at $500. So in reality, *This is the best shortwave radio under $500.*\n\nThe key to the 7600GR's success is time. The original ICF-SW7600 was introduced way back in 1977, and since then has gone through a miasma of subtle design changes and technical innovations. So as other manufacturers try to find cheaper ways to produce their all-new models, Sony has been slowly honing and refining this single design all along for over 25 years. You can be confident when you hold the 7600GR that it's the time-tested culmination of over a quarter century of engineering and design. Five stars for Sony's instant classic.";The Last Serious Radio
105;5.0;1.0;281.0;I loved this radio at first.  It has a lot of bells and whistles and appears to be a quality radio.  The earlier model lasted 20 years so when it finally gave out I purchased this model with the expectation that it would have a fair lifespan.  It was treated with kid gloves sitting on my bedside stand in an airconditioned house and used for about one hour a day.  After two years (one year after the warranty ran out) I tried to turn it on and found that keys were locked and 00:00 was flashing.  I did everything the manual advised and then tried the Sony online chat.  I was advised that it needed to be sent in for service.  Then I tried email.  They came to the same conclusion and added the link for service.  No repair was available but they offered an exchange for a reconditioned radio at the cost of $120 plus tax and shipping.  That is nearly the cost of a new radio!  I will never buy another SONY product.\n\nIf you want an expensive disposable radio with neat features, this is the one for you.;Great Features While They Last
7;6.0;5.0;316.0;"I bought this radio after trying out several Grundig portables including the YB400. The Grundigs were all cheaply made and have less than desirable reception.\nFurthermore, I bought the AN-LP1 loop antenna made by Sony. This must be the perfect set up for someone that does not want to pay loads of money but still wants a ""very"" satisfying SWL experience. I love mine and would recommend it to anyone. Especially if you travel alot like me for you business. Portable and Powerful!\nFinally, you will be suprised how easy it is to learn and operate. Most of the buttons I figured out without the user manual. However, there are a few nifty items I found in the user manual so don't forget to read it.";Best shortwave radio under $200.00
109;7.0;5.0;128.0;"I have been using the 7600 (no suffix), the grand-daddy of the 7600GR since its debut in 1992. That's close to 14 years of faithful, problem-free service until it finally died on me recently. I was sad to see it go but was all prepared to look for a better alternative. After ploughing through numerous reviews both online and off, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that its direct descendant, the 7600GR, still rates among the top portable receivers today. They are practically identical aside from some pretty superficial changes. I did appreciate the 100 station presets. That's useful for someone who uses it for listening to shortwave stations which change frequencies a lot depending on the time of day and the season. Aside from that, little else has changed. Reception-wise they're close to identical. But far from a fault, it's an indication of how well designed the 7600 was in the first place. I've seldom seen electronic appliances staying practically the same after more than a decade in service and still retain close to top spot in consumer reviews. Sony deserves congratulations for that.\n\nIn terms of build quality, I can attest to their ruggedness. These babies were built to last. My trusty old 7600 has been on the open ocean, baked in the sun, drenched in rain (wrapped in plastic of course), subjected to leaky batteries, dropped several times, and given dutiful, uncomplaining service for over a decade. Where can you find electronic equipment built like that these days?\n\nThere has been a lot of unhappiness with regards to the absence of an adaptor/transformer for the 7600GR. The original accompanying adaptors in the American market, initially the AC-E90HG and then the AC-E60A were noted to be unshielded, giving rise to RF interference with MW/SW listening. After Sony recalled them, it seems Sony did not replace the adaptor as part of the standard package in America. After reading reviews about the adaptor I had quite decided against buying it. However I managed to get the 7600GR while in Singapore 2 months ago. It was a direct Japanese import and it came with a new AC-adaptor. I'm not sure if this version is properly shielded but I've not noticed any increased interference with SW listening viz. AC-power and batteries. Note that this package is not the one offered on Amazon. My only complaint is that my original 7600's adaptor/transformer came with a 12-foot long cable meaning I could place it anywhere in the room. The new adaptor for the 7600GR is barely 6-feet in length. Also, my original 7600 came with ear-phones for stereo listening on FM. The new 7600GR does not.\n\nReception, as far as I can tell, is no different from the old model despite the addition of the highly rated ""synchronous detector"" circuit. That's in part because after so many years, I know exactly which stations I want to listen to and no longer go searching for them. I listen to both SW and FM. Stations I tune to include the BBC, Radio Australia, Radio New Zealand and occasionally Deutsche Welle and Nederlands. They sound the same on both.\n\nThese days, with the internet, you no longer have to slowly scan for stations on SW. The easiest way is to go to their websites, download their frequency charts and just directly program them into the preset memory. Actually, many stations also broadcast online. So much easier than in the past. But with a certain loss of that old mystique, anticipation and sense of adventure.\n\nI'd like to correct a statement made in one of the prior reviews. Removing the batteries for more than 60secs will not erase the station presets. The presets are stored in EEPROM which will not be erased with any power loss. What will be erased is the current time on the radio's clock but that's very easily reset.\n\nThe built-in ""tin-can"" speaker is the only part of the 7600 that I dislike. Unfortunately that has not improved. But with the proliferation of cheap, fairly good quality desktop speakers to connect to, you are spoilt for choice. I bought mine together with the $99 Klipsch 2.0 Ultra. The resultant sound is as good as you can hope to get from a world band receiver. For private listening at night, I prefer Sennheisers. They make a world of difference especially when listening to FM stereo.\n\nSome appreciative words for Sony. I managed to get my trusty old 7600 repaired in Singapore at the local Sony outlet for the equivalent of about $40. Dirt cheap for what they replaced: the worn out crystal, DC transformer, over a dozen capacitors and an equal number of switches. What I appreciated most was the fact that they repaired it with no questions asked, despite the fact that it was over 10 years old, had no proof of purchase, no warranty and was no longer in production. If you want to know what makes a loyal customer, it is a company that stands by its product. Now I am the happy owner of 2 perfectly serviceable portable receivers, one for home and one for travel.";An excellent design...  Still at the top after all these years
123;8.0;5.0;108.0;"I have noted a number of reviews mentioning that the Sony ICF-SW7600GR, in my opinion the finest small portable short wave receiver available at the present time, does not come with an AC adapter.\n\nI own three (3) of these receivers (as well as two of its predecessor receiver the ICF-SW7600G).\n\nBelieve me, you do not need (or even want) an AC adapter. This radio is extremely easy on batteries and, if you use NiMH rechargeables, as I do, your battery costs in the long run will be very, very low.\n\nWith portable radios, AC adapters, in general, cause more problems than they are worth. They often add noise which is what you DON'T want with weak short wave signals.\n\nIn my opinion, with this, or any other small portable short wave radio, rechargeable batteries are the way to go.\n\nAmazon's current price ($128.84), if that includes shipping, is a bargain.\n\nThis radio is a wonderful ""starter"" short wave radio, yet it is one that the purchaser will never outgrow.\n\nIt is also the best small portable for MW (AM broadcast) DXing. It even has a line output to feed its signal to a stereo system.\n\nDo not ignore this radio just because of the lack of an AC adapter!";AC Adapter Not Necessary
40;9.0;4.0;62.0;"First the good points - and focus on these.  I'd buy this again, knowing what I know now.  It's just that I'd be aware of a couple of things that need to be known prior to purchase.  The radio itself is great!  It's well constructed (not some light weight, cheap, thin and brittle plastic cased wannabe short wave radio.  This is relatively expensive and well worth the money. It's been on the market for a number of years, and keeps getting very high marks by such people as ham radio operators who know radios and know what to look for.\n\nSound out of a small speaker is adequate - not worse than one might expect (and shouldn't expect much more).  What's most impressive is the frequency stability - drift is almost non-existent on mine.  Sideband is outstanding, particularly in this price range.  We bought ours primarily for emergency purposes in case of a wide-scale or extended power outage, but it's turning out to be ""fun"" for this former ham radio operator that's still kind of picky.\n\nSensitivity is quite good.  CAUTION: if you aren't familiar with shortwave propagation, study up on it just a bit on the Internet or you'll be very disappointed and do what some other reviewers have apparently done.  Depending on time of day, solar storm activity, and other factors, different bands have different characteristics.  Sometimes you can scan up, and up, and up (or down), and never have it lock on to a single signal.  There are times when some bands are simply ""dead,"" and at other times those same bands (frequency ranges) can pull in signals from all over the world.  This is NOT something that Sony has any control with.  If the band's open, this radio will pick up nicely.\n\nOne huge flaw is that this is OBVIOUSLY made to make men look stupid to their wives.  We never need instructions for anything - just dig into the box, plug in whatever it is (or add batteries), and use it, right?  That's how we men are!\nWe just intuitively know how electronic and mechanical things work - we don't need no stinkin' manual!  Guys - if you can somehow get to the instruction manual before you even let anyone know the radio's been delivered, STUDY it.  There are just too many functions to be able to intuitively fit on the limited number of buttons on the front of the radio.  So do your homework and you can continue your streak of brilliance in front of your kids or your honey by taking it out of the box, sticking in batteries, turning it on, and start programming the heck out of it after pulling in China, India, BBC, South America, etc.!  (tongue-in-cheek switch / OFF).  Seriously, in order to take full advantage of all the features, this is not entirely a do-it-yourself project.  Read the manual first.  That's not a criticism, just an observation.  This radio is not an on-off, select your band, turn the frequency knob, and listen.  There's much more, and it's part of why the radio sells for the price it does - it's head and shoulders above the price-range competition.\n\nNow for the reasons why I did not rate it 5 stars.  There is no external power supply included - and you supply the batteries (all the more reason to take it out of the box before Christmas in order to ""set it up properly"" - there's your excuse so you can read the manual after everyone else has gone to bed).  ;-)  Come on, Sony - at that price, a cheap 6v plug-in power supply ought to be included.\n\nSecond, and this is a BIG hit on Amazon - DO NOT buy the Sangean antenna listed as ""frequently bought together"" with this receiver.  I got caught on that and purchased something that is IN THE BOX.  It's not labeled ""Sangean,"" but there is little doubt it's the same antenna inside, with just a minor cosmetic difference on the outside (mostly the Sangean label).  It most likely came from exactly the same factory.  Not only does the product description say there are only the internal ferrite bar antenna and the telescoping external antenna on the top of the receiver, with no mention of the plug-in long wire antenna, but the Amazon ad itself says many people buy the Sangean antenna along with the Sony receiver, implying you need to purchase it separately.  The fact is, the external plug-in long wire antenna that appears to be the same thing as the Sangean antenna, is IN THE BOX with the receiver.  Yes, I called Amazon immediately, and yes, Amazon apologized, gave me a postage-paid shipping label, and promptly credited my credit card when the Sangean antenna was received back by Amazon.  In that regard, Amazon was at their usual greatness.  But the ad for the radio (including the extended item description) are misleading or outright wrong.\n\nWithout those two glitches (the lack of an external power supply included, and the antenna BEING included but being ""pushed"" by Amazon and not listed in the product description), this would otherwise have been a very solid 5-star rating.  Note: we give very few 5-star ratings.  The product has to be way above the competition, virtually flawless, and far more impressive than just ""that's a really great [product].""  So to say it's otherwise a 5-star rating says a lot about how much I like the radio.";Nearly 5 Stars (a couple of glitches - still great!)
20;10.0;1.0;33.0;(Edited on December 5,2014)\n\nDead after three months!  Sony will only replace with a refurbished receiver.  I now think the Tecsun PL-660 is the best of the larger portable sw receivers.  It works wonderfully with the Sony AN-LP1 antenna. Very disappointed in Sony now. You cannot go wrong with any Tecsun products.\n\nOriginal review follows:\n\nI own six shortwave receivers.  Some are analog, some are digital, some are larger than others.  This is the best one that I own.  Let me explain why.\n\nPros:\n\n1) It's a Sony.  That should speak volumes about the quality already.  This radio is heavy...not too heavy, mind you, but it just has a solid feel that none of my other radios have.  The Tecsuns are good radios, mind you, but none of them have this feel to them.\n\n2) Reception and senstivity are WONDERFUL.  If you pair this with the Sony active loop antenna that is recommended with it, you get pretty darn close to sound quality on a receiver that would easily cost you $800 or more.  If you live in a condo like me, you probably have restrictions on exterior antennas and such, and buying one of those higher-end receivers isn't an option.  This would be the best solution for SWL if you're in that situation.\n\n3) The speaker is really good.  It never sounds tinny.  I read another review that said the volume wasn't room filling, but I disagree.  I've used it in every room in the house and never had any problems hearing it.\n\nCons:\n\n1) You really have to read the manual to know how to do a lot of things with this radio.  It's not as intuitive as the Tecsun PL-660 or PL-380.\n\n2) No air band.  I doubt many would buy this sort of radio to listen to the air band, but I have enjoyed it every now and then on the Tecsun PL-660.  Most radios in this price range have the air band included.\n\nIn conclusion, if you want one larger portable radio that's in the $100-$200 range, I think you'd be hard pressed to find one better.  I wouldn't give up my Tecsun PL-660 now, but I would definitely have not bought it if I had the Sony first.  Pairing this radio with the Sony loop antenna provides an excellent SWL experience for under $250.  If that's out of your budget, try the Tecsun PL-380 with the Kaito KA33 loop antenna, which will set you back about $80.;The Rolls-Royce of Portable Shortwave Receivers (until it dies)
119;11.0;4.0;69.0;I am not new to the world of DXing.  Within the last few years I've owned both a Yachtboy 400 receiver and a Realistic DX receiver and have found the shortwave experience to be very pleasurable.\n\nI chose the Sony 7600GR based on reviews I read on the web and must say I am not disappointed.  In particular, I read a review comparing the Yachtboy and a comparable Sangean receiver with the Sony.  The point that swayed me to the Sony is its low power consumption.  I use it exclusively on rechargable AA batteries (I have two sets of 4 batteries each) and am extremely satisfied with the duration of their before-recharging life.  Though I've not recorded the actual time I can play before recharging becomes necessary, my sense is that it's around 20 hours.\n\nFrom my backyard on Long Island, New York, using the the radio's whip antenna, unaided, I have received stations from halfway around the world (New Zealand, Australia, Vietnam) as well as the Middle East (Egypt, UAR) and Europe.  The Caribbean and South America are also fertile SW environments.  I was particularly interested in getting Russia, which is a snap.  My 13-year-old niece, who is totally immersed in new technology (computer, i-Pod, etc.), often joins me outside (we use a splitter to listen on separate headphones) and has become my 'navigator'.  She will suggest a country and we will use the SW guide included with the radio and go hunting!\n\nIf I have a complaint, and this is a minor one, it is that in scanning mode the program will stop for only three seconds on a captured signal before it moves on.  That doesn't give you much time to decide if you want to listen or not.  I have found that if you hit the 'direct' button on the display pad this pauses the scanning cycle and then you'll have all the time you need to make a decision.  A more serious complaint is that when you replace the batteries, you have just 60 seconds to install them before all the presets are erased.  I can replace the batteries in 30 seconds, so this is not an issue with me, but for others it might be a hassle.\n\nThe reviews stated the audio quality of the speaker is not as good as it could be.  I have found that using headphones remedies this.  Actually, I think this 'problem' is way overstated.  I use the radio to listen late at night on both AM and FM, before I go to sleep, and have no complaints about the sound.\n\nI bought this radio knowing you can spend as much as you want on desktops and various antenna arrays and computer-integrated control and obviously get better performance.  But for the money (less than $150) and convenience, it is hard to see how you could do better than the Sony 7600GR.  It affords the average person a simple, straightforward and easy introduction to world-wide radio, which I find to be vital, intriguing and not-at-all replaceable by the World Wide Web.\n\nTim Baralis\n\nCommack, NY, USA;A Portable World
106;12.0;4.0;53.0;"For several years Sony has been moving away from the Shortwave marketplace that they once dominated. One feature that Sony included on many of their more expensive radios was the Synchronous Detector circuit, which can make a big difference in the reception of signals that are suffering from selective fading and/or adjacent channel interference. Sony seemed to ""get this right"" more often than other other producers of SW sets (few even offered it).\n\nBut alas, the famous 2010 (one of my all time favorite SW radios) is gone, the SW-77 is gone, the SW-100 is gone and this year the highly innovative SW-07 has been deleted.\n\nThe 7600GR is the only remaining Sony with this feature... I would not wait too long, or it may be deleted as well!\n\nOk, but one feature does not define the radio. I must add that the 7600GR does very well when compared to more modern designs. On AM and Shortwave, reception is quite sensitive, and with the sync detector, the fact that only one bandwith is provided is not a large handicap (many sets have two bandwidths available).\n\nFM reception is good but not up to the level provided by the Eton E-5, Kaito 1103 or even the Kaito 1102. LW reception on the 7600 is very sensitive, and it has better ""image rejection"" (fewer false signals) than the E-5 or Kaito 1103. The 7600 does not have a tuning knob, so ""bandscanning"" is not as convenient as on the E-5 0r 1103. Note: the Kaito 1102 does not have LW or tuning knob.\n\nIn Summary, this is a well-built high quality (still made in Japan) radio that stacks up well against its competition.";Last Sony for sale with Sync Detector!
30;13.0;1.0;29.0;I bought this hoping it would be better than the TECSUN PL660 that I own. Boy was I wrong! To be honest it picks up the FM and commercial AM stations better than the TECSUN PL660 but that's it.\n\nMy biggest annoyance with this Sony is the scan feature. I am talking about scanning the short wave signals. (Not your preset channels.) First off it really doesn't scan, it just goes up five and repeats. In other words, you are on signal 5MHz. When you select scan instead of scanning through 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, etc it just jumps to 5.5, then 5.10, then 5.15 and looks for a signal on those channels instead of scanning all the ones in between.  Also, if you choose auto scan it leaves out huge portions of the band and in stead just looks at the more popular section of the frequency. So instead you have to manually scan it yourself with a very cumbersome control.\n\nI ran several tests. I choose ten signals that my TECSUN PL660 received, including the time beacons. The ONLY channel the Sony picked up was the 5 MHz. (For this test I was in California). On one other signal it faintly picked up a wee bit. And before you ask I used the same settings and the same external antenna on both sets.\n\nAlso the Sony just does not have the same whistle and bells and the ones it does have its difficult to use.

I believe that it is the finest compact portable shortwave receiver ever designed.\n\nTo get anything more capable, you will have to spend a LOT more money - and it is possible that, unless you research the market VERY carefully, you may get something which is not as good!\n\nThis receiver is simple to operate after reading the owner's manual. JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU READ IT! Also make sure you UNDERSTAND it! If you do not, or are not sure, then re-read it! Re-read it as often as necessary. You need not be embarrassed - no one else will know how many times you have read the instructions! (It shouldn't take more than one or two CAREFUL readings of the instructions to fully understand them.)\n\nYou must realize that this is NOT an ordinary analog AM/FM radio where all you do is turn it on, select AM or FM, and maybe change the stations with a knob.\n\nThis is in fact a sophisticated portable communications receiver and thus requires a learning curve if you are not familiar with shortwave reception. (I have read some reviews here on Amazon's site which clearly demonstrate that the writer[s] did NOT read the instructions! You'll be able to easily spot those for yourself.)\n\nIf you do read and follow those instructions, this radio is quite easy to use and, by following these instructions (and also by reading some basic books about shortwave listening such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Passport-to-World-Band-Radio-2008-Edition-Passport-to-World-Band-Radio/dp/0914941666/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Passport to World Band Radio, 2008 Edition (Passport to World Band Radio)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/World-Radio-TV-Handbook-2008-The-Directory-of-Global-Broadcasting-World-Radio-TV-Handbook/dp/0823099563/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">World Radio TV Handbook 2008: The Directory of Global Broadcasting (World Radio TV Handbook)</a>), you will derive maximum benefit from the radio. Once you have learned how to operate this receiver, you will find that using it becomes very intuitive and VERY rewarding! (Please note that the two books mentioned above introduce new editions each year; you can check for them here on Amazon.)\n\nThis receiver contains just the controls necessary to bring in signals clearly, thereby eliminating much complication that can cause difficulty in use.\n\nIts main claim to shortwave fame, in addition to its overall superb design, is its inclusion of a synchronous detection circuit (as well as full single sideband [SSB] reception), available on no other currently available new receiver in its size- and/or price-class. This circuit can make the difference between hearing a station or not hearing it. It can almost totally eliminate interference from a close-by frequency. The circuit also works on the AM band and eliminates selective fading distortion, commonly heard around dawn, dusk, or evenings when listening to distant stations. (The skywave comes in slightly behind the groundwave, or the skywave itself comes in out-of-phase, and causes distortion on other radios which makes an announcer sound as though he/she has a VERY bad cold! This annoyance will not occur on this Sony.)\n\nFor shortwave listening, it is quite sensitive off its whip antenna yet is robust enough to handle a significant external antenna, should the owner decide to use one.\n\nWith this radio, the user can easily and conveniently hear, at appropriate times of the day, English-language broadcasts from England (of course!), China, Canada, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Russia, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Viet Nam, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Jordan, Egypt, Israel, Argentina (with some GREAT tango music), India, and many, many more. Also, for those conversant in various foreign languages, there is no shortage of those as well. It is fascinating to listen to news and commentaries from these various countries and to compare equivalent news items. It is particularly interesting to see how some countries will emphasize or de-emphasize certain items and, of course, the varying opinions expressed in their commentaries are of great interest to us here in the United States.\n\nA&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sangean-ANT-60-Short-Wave-Antenna/dp/B000023VW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sangean ANT-60 Short Wave Antenna</a>&nbsp;can improve shortwave reception but is not truly necessary. (The Sangean can be plugged into the radio's antenna socket; the wind-up antenna Sony supplies with the radio cannot. It must be clipped to the whip antenna.)\n\nRegarding AM performance, this radio is superb. If desired, its AM reception can be improved by means of a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terk-Technology-AM-1000-Advantage-Passive-AM-Indoor-Antenna/dp/B000069EUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terk Technology AM-1000 Advantage Passive AM Indoor Antenna</a>, used inductively, but this too is not really necessary. Local stations come in, as expected, extremely well, both day and night (especially with use of the synchronous circuit) but what is unexpected is how well this relatively small radio receives long distance stations. At my location, Canada, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic often come in like locals! Other stations from around the country do so likewise. These signals come in loud and VERY clear. One would not expect such high quality performance from a radio this size. And while some other radios in this category may be as sensitive as this Sony, not one of them has the synchronous detection circuit which ""cleans up"" the received AM signal and makes it fully listenable.\n\nFM sensitivity, selectivity, and capture ratio are all excellent.\n\nThis radio has been manufactured unchanged since 2001; its predecessor model (from which there were only minor changes) dates back to 1994. Incredibly, in all this time, no other manufacturer has been able to design a radio even equal to this Sony, much less superior.\n\nIts construction quality is absolutely first-rate. It is still manufactured in Japan (for Sony by Towada Audio Corporation, a company located in Kosaka, a town in the Kazuno District, Akita, Japan; they actually developed the radio), unlike all other compact shortwave portables which are manufactured in China (or, rarely, in Taiwan). Japanese build quality has long been noted for it excellence and this difference really shows. Believe me, just a cursory hands-on examination or comparison between this one and any other receiver in its class will confirm that its construction quality is second-to-none (and is even better than some tabletop communications receivers).\n\nIn order to buy something ""better,"" you would have to spend at least three times the price of this radio and what you would get (the Eton E1, for example) would not be anywhere nearly as portable as this one. (Nor will its construction quality match that of this Sony.)\n\nSome people have complained about the whip antenna being somewhat delicate. In fact, all whip antennas can be damaged relatively easily. In that regard, this Sony radio is no better nor worse than any other. In any case, however, the exact replacement antenna is available from PartStore<dot>com. The antenna takes less than one minute to replace.\n\nSound quality is pretty good - great for news/talk, somewhat less so for music on FM. But even this can easily and inexpensively be corrected by means of a cable available from your local Radio Shack that will connect the radio, via its line output jack, to your stereo system. Or, should you wish to use powered auxiliary speakers, this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-Compact-Speaker-System-Z320-for-Notebooks/dp/B002FU5QLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech Compact Speaker System Z320 for Notebooks</a>&nbsp;is inexpensive and works extremely well. Of course, there are also much more expensive powered computer speakers which may (or may not!) provide better sound than the Logitechs. The choice, as always, is yours. I really like the Logitech Z320s.\n\nThis receiver can be powered by four 'AA' batteries - either by standard alkalines or, better and far more economically, by rechargeable 'NiMH' types. The radio is very efficient with batteries; a set lasts a very long time and, of course, rechargeable ones can be recharged over and over again.\n\nThe radio has over 100 memories (100 ""regular"" memories, 2 more memories for the alarm clock function, and one each for the bottom of each shortwave frequency band). These memories do NOT disappear when changing or even removing the batteries. They are totally non-volatile and will remain essentially ""forever,"" until you manually change or delete them. Even the clock remains for several minutes while changing the batteries. If, however, you remove the batteries for a long time, then you will have to reset the clock. This is very easy to do and is the only thing necessary to reset. There are, in fact, two clocks, one of which can be set to your local time, and the other which can be set to any time zone you desire; I have mine set to UTC [GMT]. (When you set the local time, the other time zone is automatically set as well so you only have to set the clock once.)\n\nSony no longer offers a suitable AC Adapter for this radio. However, Radio Shack does. And the Radio Shack AC Adapter (Cat. # 273-025; the appropriate Adapt-A-Plug [free with purchase of the adapter] is Cat. # 273-1705) is not only better than Sony's original, it is smaller and lighter in weight, and less expensive, costing only $12.99. This adapter and plug can be bought at any local Radio Shack store as well as online if you wish. (It is too bad that Amazon does not sell this adapter!)\n\nAll in all, this radio, especially at Amazon's current price, just cannot be beaten in terms of value for money.\n\nIt is, in my opinion, the best value in a shortwave receiver currently on the market and, in a world full of often ephemeral electronic ""gizmos,"" one of the few genuine electronic bargains.\n\nThis is a radio that the owner will never outgrow!\n\n================================================================================================================\n\nUpdate: May 16, 2008\n\nTo improve shortwave reception at home or when traveling, I recommend the Sony AN-LP1 Active Antenna in addition to the Sangean ANT-60 mentioned above. The AN-LP1 is powered by two AA batteries, folds neatly, and fits into a convenient storage bag. While it is for indoor use only (it mounts in a window) or outdoor use only on days on which there is no wind blowing, it is an extremely useful addition to the owner's armamentarium.\n\nIf you wish to purchase one (it sells for about $115.00 including the shipping) there is an advantage and a disadvantage - and they are both the same! Currently this antenna is being sold ONLY by an eB@y dealer in Japan (just Google ""Buyfromjapan"" and then enter ""AN-LP1"" in his search box) -- but he is absolutely reliable and FAST - you'll have your antenna in less than a week by Express Mail - and he takes the usual major credit cards as well as PayPal.\n\nI believe that using an AN-LP1 with an ICF-SW7600GR results in an almost ""perfect"" portable shortwave reception center.";The Finest Compact Portable Shortwave Receiver

10;16.0;5.0;10.0;"I have a reissue of a Fender Twin Reverb guitar amplifier designed in 1965.  It's the same amplifier because they got it right back then and you can't improve on it.  Likewise, the decades old technology of the SonySW7600GR was so right the first time, I bought one last year after wanting one since the 1980s.  For what it is, a portable shortwave radio, you couldn't do better.\n\nThe sensitivity, selectivity, synchronous detection and SSB reception are outstanding for a tiny radio.  Like other reviewers have noted, there is no analog tuning option, but that's only a factor in SSB reception and the BFO range is more than enough to cover the space in between button tuning stops.  I am a ham radio operator.  My radio shack is in the basement two floors below my bedroom.  When I see a DX station posted on the cluster when I'm watching TV in the bedroom, I turn on the 7600 and see if I can hear it in the bedroom, with the whip antenna.  If I can, I'll go down to the basement.  If I can't hear it on the 7600, I save myself the trip because it's unlikely I'd be able to work it with the primary ham station.  I'm not saying the performance is equivalent to a full fledged ham station's receiver and antenna, but it's good enough to serve as a ""gateway"" receiver.\n\nThe build is solid and, once you get the hang of it, the controls are easy enough to use.  I seen some reviewers to do side by side comparisons with other portables or complain they can't receive anything on the 7600 and I have to wonder if they have the attenuator control activated?\n\nAnother fine Sony product.";It's Been Around for So Long Because It's That Good

Within that review, the author mentioned that the AC power cord was not included.\n\nAmazon reported the power cord was no longer offered (Sony ACE60HG AC Adaptor $22.99); so I searched about the web to discover the AC power cord is $49. At six other businesses, the power cord is consistently $49.\n\nFor what reason would I purchase an AC cord at 1/3 the price of the radio - this seems to be a basic inclusion with the product.

48;18.0;1.0;33.0;I bought this radio to save wear and tear on my Sony ICF-2010, which is more than 20 years old and still in good working condition. The performance isn't great, but was about what I expected given the price and size of the radio. However, the build quality is much worse than I expected. It has the build quality of a cheap, throwaway Sony Walkman and is not remotely comparable to the ICF-2010 in build quality or in any other respect.\n\nI bought an AC transformer on eBay but only got about 6 months use from it before the AC input jack stopped working. Now the Page button has failed. It's the button used in combination with a number to jump to different pages of presets. The Page button is frozen and doesn't spring back, but it still is possible, with difficulty, to change to a different page of presets by pushing the Page button followed by a number.;Poor build quality
57;19.0;1.0;35.0;If anyone is considering, the Sony ICF-SW7600GR world band receiver radio, I suggest looking for another portable set.  I read the reviews and then made the purchase.  My main interest was to purchase a good shortwave radio.\n\nThis radio cannot pull in the signal very well at all even after clipping an extension wire onto the antenna.\n\nI located an old Grundig YB305 portable digital shortwave radio to compare to the Sony.  The old Grundig is far a better radio then the Sony.  The Grundig YB305 pulled in every signal and locked on.  The Sony scanned right over them as if they weren't even there.  Here's a brand new Sony radio and I am going to have to see if I can get some warranty work to fix the problem.\n\nTo compare the sound, I will say the Grundig YB305 is better.  There is a fuller rich sound for playing the FM music.  Sony is okeh, but not great.\n\nYou would think that if it's a Sony it's gotta be good, but the Sony is a phoney.\n\nCurrently I am only using the Sony as an AM/FM radio.\n\nI looked into warranty work and Sony will replace it with a refurbished one that may have cosmetic damage.  I didn't purchase this radio to trade it in on someone's old refurbished radio.  The cost to me would be the price for mailing the radio in, maybe $25.  $25 extra to listen to SW...that is if the replacement radio will work as intended.  Still taking a chance here.  I am now attempting to locate someone who can maybe fix my radio.  If not, I will continue to use it as an AM/FM only.\n\nIn the old days the radio could be brought to a Sony repair station to be fixed.  There used to be one in the area but that is not the case now.  Getting someone else to fix it is not worth the cost as the total would equal the purchase price.\n\nAppears with the mass produced chinese @#$* products there is no quality control.  You may get a good one or you may get a bad one.  Word of advice, do not throw out the box right away like I did on trash collection day.;Sony ICF-SW7600GR is Phoney Bologna
3;20.0;4.0;40.0;"Sony never sounds as good as a Grundig, but has lots more goodies in a smaller package.  Get the active antenna (Sony AN-LP1)and you'll hear a lot more stations.  People new to shortwave listening are usually disappointed when they turn the new radio on and hear nothing but static. Rather than take it back or toss it in the closet, get a better antenna and you'll hear what's out there.  The little whips that come on these things just don't add much to the true value of the receiver. A few of the ""big boys"" (BBC, etc) have stopped beaming directly to the USA  but you can still hear their broadcasts to other parts of the world.  This radio will satisfy.  As with any portable, if you want more stations on shortwave, use a better antenna.  I'd also recommend the yearly updated guidebook ""Passport to Worldband Radio"" (available at Amazon).";Better with an Active Antenna
36;21.0;5.0;23.0;The last remaining Sony shortwave radio is the miraculous ICF-SW7600GR. It is the product of\ndecades of development and expertise. Can one radio do everything you've dreamed of (especially for\nunder $200?) Yes, it can.\n\nMy perspective includes decades of listening beginning 47 years ago in 1965. Back then, a standard\nshortwave radio for a casual listener was not portable. It was a five-tube desktop model that simply\nexpanded upon tried and true AM radios found in every household. If you needed advanced features and\nhigh performance, you would need to invest in an expensive multi-tube boat anchor!\n\nTimes have changed dramatically. The Sony ICFSW7600GR covers 150 kHz to 30 MHz, featuring a\ndouble conversion design with synchronous detection, along with the 76 to 108 MHz ready for FM reception\nworldwide. Gone are mechanical pushbuttons. The Sony challenges you to fill up 100 electronic preset\nmemories! Included is a multi-zone clock displaying local time and UTC. You can choose regular AM reception\nor USB/LSB along with CW. A very useful RF gain control and a display light (for night operation) are\nprovided, as well. The features go on and on!\n\nMy smiles began early. I was extremely impressed with its operation. The controls are quite intuitive and simple\nto master. I entered one of my favorite frequencies, 14.060 MHz (the 20 meter CW QRP calling frequency) and\nimmediately heard a one watt station calling CQ. The telescopic whip antenna was down with just my finger\nresting upon it. There was no shortage of in-the-clear shortwave broadcast stations\nto listen to. How do they make a portable radio this selective and sensitive?\n\nMore early trials produced more amazing results. Again, with no whip antenna extended, I pulled in\nseveral time reference broadcasts from America's WWV and CHU Canada. Reverting back to my childhood, I\ntried aeronautical VOLMET weather frequencies and logged New York, Gander, Newfoundland and Shannon,\nIreland immediately with little effort. The precision of frequency direct-entry combined with the\nclarity of the sideband reception was almost unnerving! Plenty was heard on 30 and 40 meter CW. All I\ncould say was `Wow!'\n\nOne transmission lives on through the decades. Radio Australia still broadcasts towards the east,\ncovering the Pacific islands and beyond, every morning on 9580 kHz. They have ruled this frequency for\ndecades with a dominant signal that is hard to surpass. I took the ICF-SW7600GR to work and tried to pick\nthem up. Radio Australia locked in with full quieting while standing by a window. I walked into the building\namong literally tons of electronic equipment surrounded by steel and concrete. The signal could still be\nheard! I know Radio Australia uses a lot of power but this is miraculous.\n\nLongwave reception was also pretty remarkable. Again, with just built-in antennas, I logged NDBs (nondirectional\nbeacons) FR 407 kHz in Farmingdale, Long Island and OGY 414 kHz near Jacob Riis Park in The\nRockaways in Queens. These stations are used as navigation aids and transmit very slow AM modulated\nMorse Code continually. You'll never hear a station more anxious to be logged!\n\nThe ICF-SW7600GR also offers synchronous detection. You can derive a full AM carrier from just\none sideband. This is particularly useful if you have a very strong adjacent station or you are trying to\nmaneuver through digital IBOC HD Radio interference. I often get clobbered by the digital sideband of KDKA\n1020 Pittsburgh while trying to listen to WBZ 1030 Boston. Synchronous detection can make this noisy\nmess into something quite listenable. It is certainly welcomed at this listening post.\n\nThis is a sophisticated radio delivered in a classy manner. It is beautifully designed and quite attractive.\nThe ICF-SW7600GR is the size and weight of a somewhat heavy paperback book. Every button and control\nwas found in a logical place which could be easily memorized for in-the-dark middle-of-the-night\nreception. The LCD display is big and easy to read. With 100 memories, you don't need to do a lot of direct\ntuning. Multiple frequency comparisons are a breeze. Sony even thought of every final touch. The unit comes\nwith a very attractive black cloth case. Slip the radio into the case and a fold-over leaf covers it neatly\nsecured with a couple of pieces of Velcro.\n\nI'm sure I have only just begun to appreciate everything this radio can do. I'm still mesmerized with\ndirect frequency entry. There is no noticeable drift and the battery life seems endless. Sony's operations\nmanual goes on for dozens of pages. Also included is the 128 page Sony Wave Handbook, a very comprehensive\nall-band guide to familiarize you with the world of shortwave and beyond. A cute self-contained\nreel of wire, with built-in end clips, is included as a useful portable antenna. Sony included everything you\nneed to get started immediately. You can become a fairly sophisticated worldband listener by just opening\nthe box. What fun!\n\nThe essence of shortwave has not changed that much since 1965. All the bands are still there. You'll\neven find several new band allocations for broadcasters have come alive. Like visiting old neighborhoods\nfrom your childhood, often the flavor has become something completely new. Many of the old standard\nbroadcasters are hard to find or gone entirely. The Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Germany and even\nthe BBC and Voice of America are missing in action. Many religious stations have popped up along with\nsome newly dominant Asian broadcasters.\n\nAs a side note to this review, this receiver can also be used as a fairly accurate frequency counter.\nMaybe I need to get out a lot more, but nearly everything I use to pursue amateur radio has either inaccurate\nanalog tuning or dubious digital tuning without reliable accuracy. With a zero-beat accurate Sony\nICF-SW7600GR around, I can finally discover what frequency I am actually transmitting on!\n\nIn a reality check, I am certainly aware that this wonderful receiver is really nothing new. Its direct ancestor,\nThe Sony ICF-SW7600G, was first released in 1994 and has nearly every feature the current ICFSW7600GR\noffers. This Sony line of compact shortwave receivers can be traced back to 1977 with the release of the\noriginal ICF-7600 featuring an analog tuner. The current model employs all the lessons learned from this long legacy\nto produce a remarkable product. The Sony ICF-SW7600GR is a great deal of fun available for very little money.\nGet one and enjoy every minute.;Bundle of Joy
124;22.0;5.0;37.0;"I'm very new to the world of shortwave (2 days now).  I came across a thread on a messageboard describing the ""Conet Project"" which is basically a CD collection of various ""numbers stations"" that have been collected through listening to shortwave radio.  These audio loggings intrigued me greatly, and I decided that I wanted to enter the world of shortwave.\n\nSo what to do?  I have no friends who know what shortwave is, much less what radio to buy.  I took a trip to my local Radio Shack and was not impressed with their selection.  I did a lot of research online and pretty well figured out that this radio is universally hailed as a great portable and an excellent starter radio.  I ordered the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, used super saver shipping, and got it on Monday after Thanksgiving (Thanks Amazon!).  I've been using this bad boy ever since and let me tell you, I have been completely overwhelmed at what I could pick up with this thing.  I've received HAM radio communcations, BBC with excellent clarity, FM stations that I normally cannot pick up here, AM stations from my hometown that are weak, and quite a few of these treasured ""numbers stations"" that got me so interested in the first place.\n\nI'll be honest, I haven't tested another radio, so I have little to compare to.  But this radio exceeded my expectations for 128 dollars and change.  It's very well constructed, and comes with a nifty carrying case and a spool type antenna.  Receptiion with the included antenna is nothing short of awesome.\n\nThe only downside I can find is the fact that no AC adapter was included.  Why Sony would not include something like this is beyond me, but I'm not going to complain a lot.  I've read that AC adapters can cause unwanted interference, especially the one that this radio uses.\n\nI don't know how I can wrap this up other than saying that I'm new to shortwave, I find it very interesting, and this radio pleases me greatly.  Unless you want to spend a lot more money, this will be your best bet.";As far as I can tell, it's the perfect starter radio
54;23.0;1.0;27.0;With just a little more common sense and effort, this radio could have been great. However, I found it to be a huge disappointment. The first thing you notice is that the whip antenna is not securely attached to the radio and moves around loosely within the plastic radio housing. When the antenna is fully extended, this translates to a 4 to 6 inch left-right thrashing. The digital display is invisible when looking down on the radio from above. This would be for example when the radio is on a table or night stand and you are in the seated position. The radio must be tilted back or you must look at the display from below for the digits to appear. The radio has a multitude of slide switches which are notorious for going open or intermittent. But the main disappointment is the tuning scheme used in the SSB mode. To hit the correct beat note, there is a thumb wheel on the side of the radio that provides a frequency offset. The problem is that the adjustment or rotation range is about plus and minus 5 KHz which is very course. This makes fine adjustment of the LSB or USB pitch very difficult. The range of the thumb wheel should have been plus or minus 1 KHz rather than 5 KHz. All in all, the radio is just awkward to use. You wouldn't want it on your night stand in the dark as the dial light is very dim and useless. Put your money into something with better engineering such as the AOR.;Poor design effort
121;24.0;5.0;34.0;This ia an excellent SW radio. As a matter of fact, the best for its price. The only catch is the lack of noise-free (filtered) SONY AC adapter.\n\nThe newer replacement Sony AC adapter, called the AC E60A emits interference (RFI) making it unsuitable for use with world band radios. Sony does not currently offer a satisfactory AC adapter for the Sony ICF-SW7600GR\n\n(...) AMAZON censored this review. I suggested originally  an URL to solve the problem with the adapter (Universal Radio -- check under Sony ICF-SW7600GR), AMAZON doesn't offer the right adapter but (selfishly) deleted the URL. It seems as there are new rules in AMAZON. Sorry.\n\nADDENDUM: Unlike the 7600G, the GR mutes for 1 sec. for EACH press of the frontal panel tuning arrows. So you can't tune by repeatedly pressing the arrows and hearing what  is being received (as I usually tune the 7600G).

4;25.0;5.0;31.0;"I have owned the Grundig 300 PE which stands far far from the Sony SW-7600GR.  If you are into world band, or just beginning you should get the right stuff.  With the YB300PE you will waste your money with poor performance.  When you compare the grundig equivalent (YB 400PE) as in ""Passport to World band radio"" the main difference is sound quality.  The grundig is much better.  But I feel that what is the need of better acoustics if you can't get adequate reception.  I overcome the sound issue by using headphones, it sounds greatr on it.  Just the SSB option that is mainly found on expensive models is worth every penny when you need to weed out bad co-stations.  Yes it is 149 versus 79 for YB300PE and 129 for YB400PE, but it is worth it.  It does not come with an AC adapter but you can find one at radioshack rather inexpensively.  I would definetly recommend the AN-LP1 antenna to go with it, it is the best loop for portables on the market.  It will make your radio stop constantly as it finds new stations.  The only drawback that it can be a bit comfusing to use at first, but with time it becomes easy.  Best bang for your buck.";AWESOME
107;26.0;5.0;27.0;Although I feel this radio is the best of it's class, there are a couple pretty bad flaws.\n\nFirst off they use very cheap potentiometers for the volume and SSB fine tuning. Anyone who has had this radio for more than a few months will tell you that the volume and SSB tuning pots will get flaky. It is important to have a good SSB fine tuning control yet this radio fails miserably due to the cheap pots used.\n\nThe second flaw is the sync detection. While the sync detector does it's job well, it does so at the expense of a loss of AGC. Normally the automatic gain control will vary the amount of amplication of the signal as the strength of the sigal varies so that the volume level stays the same. When you switch in the sync detector, it appears the AGC is completely turned off. Using the sync detection with a fading signal (which is the purpose of the sync detection) will give you a signal that is not distorted, but one that varies widely in volume. Turning off the sync detection restores the AGC but now you will have a distorted signal.\n\nThere is no reason AGC couldn't be included with sync detection other than laziness of the designer, or more probably, cutting costs to keep the radio cheap, as is evident by the cheap pots used.;Some Bad Flaws
12;27.0;5.0;7.0;This is a great shortwave receiver and it is also quite good for mediumwave (AM broadcast band). It has synchronous detection you can turn on and that is good for reducing interference in AM (shortwave or mediumwave) signals. The synchronous detector performs well and it locks into even fairly weak AM signals. And you can receive CW and SSB (it is not very selective for CW or SSB but it is still useful). It also has a standard FM stereo receiver but to listen in stereo you have to plug in headphones or an external speaker. It also has longwave, and I have been able to receive beacons. It has decent sensitivity, better than some other portables and you can plug in an external antenna (not included). The only thing really missing is it does not have a noise blanker. The receiver is sensitive and no noise blanker means you will hear impulse noise (from arcing power lines, electric fences, etc.) if you have such noise sources in your area. Also, there is no tuning knob. Some people might find the absence of a tuning knob to be annoying but I don't think it is really that bad. You can directly enter a frequency, get to a frequency from the memory (which you can program), and there are up and down buttons to change frequency or you can scan. This is a very functional, quality radio.;Great shortwave/mediumwave radio!
13;28.0;1.0;8.0;Amazon must have a defective batch. I bought my first unit in December 2015. The FM reception was distorted, it seems the radio was off frequency. For example, 95.7 came in clearer at 95.6 than 95.7. My other radios had no problem picking up this station at the same location at the correct frequency. I exchanged the radio for a replacement, this one is also going back, as it has the same issue.;Amazon must have a defective batch
9;29.0;5.0;5.0;"My main reason for ordering the 7600GR vs. the Tecsun PL-660 or PL-880 came down to Sony's consistent high quality, and numerous reports of quality issues with the Tecsun models.  This radio may not be as feature-rich or ergonomically comfortable as others, but it has a consistent reputation for being reliable and bullet-proof.  I'm not willing to spend over $100 for something that has frequent reports of buggy firmware and of failing after 6 months or 2 years.\n\nI cut my SWL teeth on 1950's-era real radios that glow in the dark.  In later decades I graduated to the excellent general coverage receiver built into my ham transceiver.  So I've always taken continuous coverage of the MW and SW bands as a given. I'm used to options like variable filters.  But operating the Sony 7600 is a very different experience.\n\nThe 7600GR is a great radio, every bit deserving of it's sterling reputation, but its a lean-featured portable, not a full-service desktop rig.  There are design compromises dictated by its low price point and intended use.  If your interests lie in cruising world band AM stations, carrying the radio in your luggage or DXing from a picnic table in the park, and in getting reliable quality for under $200, this may be the radio for you.  But if you really want to explore all the nooks and crannies of the spectrum, chase pirates, utilities and number stations, and dig into the ham bands, I don't think this radio will pass muster.  I'd suggest you spend a few hundred dollars more for a desktop or SDR rig.  If your budget can stand it, there are good new products in the $450-$700 range, or go to the used market.\n\nWhat don't I like about the 7600?  There's no tuning knob.  You tune in incremental steps, which doesn't work too well except for broadcasters. (Hams and pirates don't pick frequencies in neat 5-kHz steps.)  The coverage isn't continuous. There a gaps, such as the entire 20-meter ham band. Tuning SSB signals is touchyt. The audio quality is okay, but certainly not great even even on FM or when using headphones.\n\nThere are constraints on external antenna options.  There's an external antenna jack, but Sony says you should only use it for their optional and expensive active loop antenna because the jack puts a DC voltage on the antenna.  Other antennas, such as the included roll-up wire antenna, clip to the end of the built-in whip.  MW reception is good enough and the internal loopstick is directional, which is what you want for MW DXing, but any additional MW antenna would have to be inductively coupled, not directly connected to the radio.  This isn't unusual for loop antennas, but it would be nice to have the full range of options.\n\nA few other thoughts:\n\n1. Expect a learning curve. Read the instructions.\n2. If you haven't, take time to read up on radio propagation. It's a complex topic. Make sure your expectations are realistic.\n3. How well your receiver works depends just as much on your antenna system as it does on the radio itself. You don't have to spend lots of money. A few feet of wire can make a big difference over a built-in whip.\n4. For many of us, interference from household ""stuff"" like computers, TVs, wall chargers and power supplies, and power lines themselves, can create major problems.  This RFI (radio frequency interference) has gotten much worse in recent years. An outdoor antenna, or a directional antenna like a loop, may help null out a lot of the RFI.  You can build your own, or buy.  ""Active"" antennas may or may not help much, and they're expensive.\n5. The only truly quiet power source is batteries.  Using a plug-in wall supply may let in RFI (noise) from the power lines, nearby appliances, and possibly from the wall supply itself!  If you must have one, make sure it's not a ""switching"" type supply, but a ""regulated"" design.\n\nAbove all, have fun!";A Great Radio If You Want A Portable
33;30.0;3.0;15.0;"I'm sad. Because the Tecsun (PL-660) and Sangean (CL-100) radios I have that are comparable to this Sony are 1) more user-friendly; 2) pick up signals better; 3) have better sound quality (yes, this is subjective, but it's my ears we're talking about); and 4) are cheaper. Why does this make me sad? Because I bought the Sony after buying the Chinese radios, thinking, ""Hey, this is one of the few SW/AM/FM radios actually still made in Japan -- it's got to be great!"" Well, it's ""good."" If I never had a Tecsun or Sangean, I'd probably think this radio is incomparable -- unless you're talking about actually using the thing. I'm sorry, but just because a radio has a ""digital"" tuner, doesn't mean we want to tune it by keying in numbers constantly. There's nothing wrong with a tuning knob, and the Tecsun PL-660 has the best tuning knob I've used, bar none, even on hi-end amplifier/stereos. It feels good, and is very sensitive, but not overly sensitive to movement. Just plain works. To my surprise, when I put the Tecsun and this Sony next to each other and did a tuning test, the Tecsun PL-660 flat blew the Sony away. It's a good thing the Sony has a more ""flexible"" (some would say ""fragile"") antenna, because it needed all that flexibility to try to pull in some stations that the Tecsun just soaked up. In about 1 hour of testing, AM/FM and SW bands, I never moved the Tecsun antenna once, while the Sony's was dancing and flapping all over the place. As for sound quality, I just prefer the Tecsun (and Sangean) -- they don't sound ""tinny"" to my ears, and I'm talking about all bands and types (talk/music/etc.). The Sony just sounds flat. The only issue I'm not sure about, and can't make a judgement on, is the long-term reliability of these three radios. Yes, Sony has a ""name"" and history/reputation that Sangean and Tecsun don't. Long story short: let's just say I'm as surprised as anyone to be rating the Chinese brands higher than the Sony. Maybe in a year from now, or five, I'll have something different to say.\nUPDATE (12/22/12): I recently purchased the Tecsun PL380 and lo and behold I prefer it to its larger brother PL-660. No, it doesn't have SSB, but if you're using it for AM/FM/SW (no SSB), it's just as good at pulling in stations, a bit easier and more intuitive in terms of the user interface, and about 1/3 the size. Why am I saying this in a Sony ICF-SW7600GR review? Because I would actually rate the (much) cheaper Tecsun PL380 higher than the Sony ICF-SW7600GR in terms of usability, ability to pull in stations, sound quality. Again, long-term build quality is the only unknown.";Sony ICF-SW7600GR ... letdown?
23;31.0;2.0;12.0;"A number of years ago, I owned a Sony 2010 short wave portable. Because of its complexity, I didn't like it. Most of my Short Wave Listening (SWL) is done late at night, in the dark, without waking my wife. So, a radio which requires a lot of fiddling around, doesn't suit.\n\nRecently, I began searching for a less expensive and smaller portable, instead of using my Ham Radio transceivers for this purpose. A study of the Amazon reviews, and others, convinced me that the three best radios out there are the Sangean 909x, the Sony 7600GR, and the Tecsun 660. I ordered all three from Amazon, and compared them side by side for a week. I made no attempt to grade all the bells and whistles, but instead, only evaluated a few central characteristics, including build quality, tuning ease, FM music quality, and shortwave and Ham Band sensitivity. The results were quite surprising! As a check, I used my two Ham transceivers (ICOM 706MkIIG & Kenwood TH F6A) to compare.\n\nThe Sony 7600GR has a very high build quality, and has reasonable audio for FM music listening. In addition, it was very slightly better than the runner-up (Tecsun) for its main function for me: SW and Ham Band listening. However, the radio has several fatal design flaws. The primary one is its awkward, almost infuriating, tuning method when you're sweeping through a SW or Ham band looking for stations: UP/DOWN buttons which create about a half-second silent pause each time you change the frequency. A  second issue, is the tiny, weak display screen; compared to the Sangean, the display screen looks positively archaic. A  minor consideration is that the antenna mount is quite flimsy, allowing the antenna of this brand new radio to wobble around like it's worn out. Finally, the thumb wheels on the side of the radio are awkward to use. In comparison with this, the Sangean is a much better piece of equipment, EXCEPT that its ability to pull in short wave and Ham stations is amazingly weak! In this side by side comparison, the Tecsun 660 was the clear leader: by far the best tuning mechanism, very adequate SW and Ham band sensitivity, knobs that project out of the side and are exceptionally easy to use, the smallest size and weight of the three compared here, and the CHEAPEST...by far! I happily sent the Sony and the Sangean back to Amazon and received an immediate refund.";INITIALLY IMPRESSIVE, BUT BADLY FLAWED

93;33.0;4.0;21.0;"I have had this radio about a week, and it is my first such since I had a Zenith Transoceanic back in the 1960s (a warbling wooden suitcase), so I know nothing. The Sony is a compact little jewel with a well-made, tight-fitting vinyl case.\n\nIt takes some time to program (preset) good stations, as there is no dialing, which is probably a good thing. First, I put the 10 best FM stations on Page 1, and the 10 best AM stations on Page 2. These presets can be accessed directly by ""speed dialing"" 0 through 9, or scanned one after the other by pressing Scan. Next I made Page 3 for SW stations. I found on the web the bands that are good at night and day, and began scanning them and writing down strong stations. Letting the radio scan takes time, as it pauses 3 seconds every 5 mhz and there are many bands of mhz to scan. There are very few English SW broadcasts to the US, and I am in the middle of the country, so there is not much at all. I decided to dedicate Page 3 to night SW stations, of which there are enough good ones to fill up the ten presets. Page 4 will be for morning and daytime stations, but there are so few strong daytime English stations that there will be only a few presets on that page.\n\nI am disppointed that so many of the strong English SW stations seem to be religious (bible) broadcasts. I think one must take a worldband radio out of the US to hear good English news SW, as little English SW seems to be broadcast at the US. The BBC website says that there is change in listening habits away from SW and its broadcasts to the US are now on satellite radio.\n\nI have the included reel antenna stretched out across 20 feet of windows, and a $100  20"" diameter active Sony AN-LP1 folding antenna in one window. They seem about the same, and not a lot better than the radio's own whip. The AN-LP1 will be good where there is only one window to use or no room to string out the reel, but I wonder if it justifies its cost. The little speaker is fine for SW and for voice, but not satisfying for music, so I have gotten a $30 Logitech X-14 powered speaker system for local FM and AM, which also sound great through Sennheiser MX-400 earphones.\n\nI bought a Maha MH-C204W charger kit and two sets of 2650 NiMH rechargable batteries, and the first set is going strong after a week of fiddling. I think a table says they should last 40 hours.\n\nThe Sony radio, the AN-LP1 antenna and the Maha charger kit, all in their respective vinyl cases, fit neatly side by side in a zip-top toilet article kit about 10""x10""x3"". I like the price, quality, features and compact size of this radio. As a worldband radio it is great. I would give it 5 stars if it sounded better for general listening, but then I suppose the speaker would have to be more powerful, the case would have to be deeper, and the batteries might not last as long.";Take time to program it
56;34.0;5.0;18.0;"The Sony ICF-7600GR is a great little shortwave radio. Read the instruction manual- operation of this radio is easy but not intuitive. I it is much easier to operate than my Sony SW77 and it is easier to tune in SSB than the SW77.\n  Sony is the last of the giant manufacturers to offer a shortwave radio and it is still made in Japan not China, and I thank them for continuing to make a product that only appeals to a small niche of Customers.\n  That being said, first of all it is not a ""boom box"" designed for music listening. The FM reception is adequate+. It is a small radio with a tiny speaker that reproduces the vocal range (200hz-5000hz) with clarity without causing fatigue to the listener. The sound quality is ideal for shortwave listening (SWL). Headphones sound great and receive FM in stereo with high fidelity. AM(MW) reception is great. If you are looking to primarily listen to music, it is the wrong radio for you. This radio is primarily designed for SWL. I will not gripe about a couple of features that this radio is missing, since it does an outstanding job without them.\n  The 7600GR tunes SW in 5khz or 1khz steps, allowing for fine tuning. It has synchronous detection available to lock in weak stations that suffer from fading or interference from adjacent channels. It also comes with a wire antenna extension which greatly improves reception of distant signals. The 7600GR has a variable antenna attenuator that is far more useful than a DX/ local switch.\n  I have some hints for beginners. First of all when you scan frequencies by meter band, make use of the attenuator. Select a meter band and then manually find a dead channel (frequency). Then adjust the attenuator until you find the threshold of the ""tune"" icon in the upper left of the display. When the tune icon comes on from background static, back off until it disappears and then hit the scan (arrow) button. By doing this, it will bypass dead channels and only stop on channels with active broadcasting. Keep the radio and antenna extension wire near a window and away from flourescent lights, light dimmers,TV(s), computers and other electrical devices for best reception. For serous listening with an indoor antenna, buy an active loop antenna and hang it in the window. Kaito makes one. I am using the Sony AN-LP1 active loop which is excellent but discontinued and still available on the internet. The loop is a major improvement over the wire extension, it reduces background noise and static, and you will not get any better reception unless you use an outdoor antenna. SWL is better after dark, due to atmospheric conditions and the broadcaster scheduling for times that they know listeners are home. Most countries have at least an hour or two of english speaking broadcasts every day. When you listen to AM(MW), keep in mind that the built in ferrite core antenna is bi-directional, and rotating the radio position can improve reception and reduce background noise.\n  I would Highly recommend the ICF-7600GR to anyone that wants a highly effective receiver for shortwave. You can nit-pick when comparing to other SW portables, but you will not find any noticeable improvement unless you spend $500.00 for an Eton E1XM.\n\nRegards,  <<<JJ>>>";Great little shortwave radio
19;35.0;1.0;10.0;If you're a novice and reading the reviews of those who are radio experts and used to using Short wave, etc. the reviews are directed towards other users, who are likewise, conversant and well-versed with these types of radios. The radio comes with no batteries and no AC adaptor just in case you didn't notice - you have to buy the AC adaptor for $7-8 separately on Amazon. Also, if you want shortwave you'll have to use the cassette with a retractable string-like antenna that comes with the radio (I don't remember seeing that described). It connects to your radios long extendable antenna and you must clip the accessory horizontal antenna from the cassette to the radio's extendable antenna and the other end gets clipped to a blind or shade near a window. So, if you think you're going to pop this out of the box, load it with batteries and turn it to shortwave and dial in the UK or Asia, it's simply not that easy! Further, you have to go through a SW booklet that is provided with the kit to find out what frequencies there are on SW in different countries and when they broadcast. The booklet is in such fine print you practically need a flashlight and magnifying glass to find the frequencies or read it. Then you must try to find the frequencies by scanning stations, which is very slow and why you must consult the hard copy book to find the frequency and input it directly into the radio. Then you may not get honed in on the frequency, so you have to fiddle around with it to fine tune it to a frequency, I suppose next to your window. The buttons are very small. It's not very user friendly, except for radio geeks, I guess. The back display is quite dim (not for those who are sight-impaired). I suppose the best place to use it is in a stationary location. You aren't going to be able to pull this radio out and walk around the house or tune it in for others to hear Radio Free Europe, etc! Everyone will have to huddle around the best spot for reception. I can't imagine how horrible the reception would be in a shelter or your basement during an emergency. You can get AM and FM easily with great reception, but there are a lot of less expensive and easier to use radio alternatives out there than this one for that. I've had many Sony products. They are pretty high quality and sometimes hard to use. This is one of them. I suppose small buttons are for small fingers! Plus this is all grey and silver except for 2 buttons in blue, so it's not visually appealing. The display is in fairly small font. Bottom line, it's not easy to use and it's not worth $130 for the average user who wants to have a radio that can tune in the world, such as in an emergency. If you want to use a radio like this, you might as well be a HAM radio operator. I read all the reviews and was duped because as with all reviews, you don't know the background of the reviewers, so you can't always go by the reviews. I'm a simple novice to radio and SW, etc. and speaking to those people out there who would like to just tune in to radio broadcasts in countries around the world to know what's going on or just for fun, you will be disappointed and this is not user friendly for the average novice user.;Too Complicated and Too Inconvenient for Use by Average User -- AVOID

I received a Grundig YB300 for Christmas, but upgraded to this model shortly thereafter.  I have been very happy ever since.\nThe Sony SW7600GR has wonderful reception.  I have hooked up an outdoor wire antenna also, which helps greatly with more faint reception.  The built in attenuator is very handy for cutting down the signal on strong stations and can be shut off entirely for weeker station reception.  I love the 100 station presets too, which is really all one needs for shortwave listening.  The sound is ok, but with headphones is superb.  I have also hooked the receiver up to my stereo via the line out jack, and this, too, sounds superb.\nThe dual clocks are handy, and I also use the radio as an alarm clock to wake up to the radio in the morning.  When using this feature, the radio automatically goes into sleep mode and will shut off by itself even if you forget to do so.  I have had the radio for a month and half so far and the 4 AA batteries are still going strong - very good on battery usage.  I also purchased the AC adaptor, but really only use it for FM listening because it adds an internal hum to AM reception, which is the only negative.\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with a introductory shortwave/AM/FM radio.  It's a great value for the money.;Perfect starter radio

52;40.0;5.0;15.0;"I bought this radio with some skepticism since I have owned 3 portable shortwave radios in the past (2 digital, 1 analog) and recall the frustration in receiving SW stations clearly. However, when I could tune one in, I enjoyed listening in on distance stations from other countries, hearing their news or sometimes hearing their perspective of U.S. news. It is often substantially different than that reported by our media. Well, I unpacked the Sony SW7600GR and was immediately impressed with it's build quality and somewhat surprised at it's size (smaller than I thought it would be). I turned it on, pulled up the antenna, started scanning and initially not much but static on the SW bands. I was a bit disappointed even though I was inside and knew that I would need an external antenna to clearly tune in SW stations, especially living in Montana, up against the Rockies to the West and far from the east coast. I then tried the AM and FM bands and was very satisfied. All stations I knew of came in clear and even tuned in some I have never heard before, especially in the AM band. The speaker is small and the sound is far from full (it does have a voice-music tone switch which helps a bit), but it is a small portable radio so I didn't expect much in this area. I got it for talk rather than music and the sound is good for this purpose.\n\nI take my dogs for a walk almost every night and decided to take the Sony along to see what it would do outside of the house, away from the typical household interference. WOW!!!! With only the built in roughly 3 foot antenna, I was able to tune in quite a few SW stations very clearly and many more with lesser signal to noise but still clear enough to listen to with ease. I started filling the presets with interesting channels and might have been able to fill most of the 100 presets if I programmed them with all of the different stations I could pick up. I honestly couldn't believe it. I do live on the outskirts of town, it was during winter and about 6:00-7pm, which is generally the optimum time to listen, but still very impressive. I can hardly wait to get a decent tuned external antenna set up outside of my house. I don't know if this was a fluke, (three different nights now, same results) or what, but so far, I am very pleased.\n\nAgain, I know that reception can vary considerably depending on seasons, time of day, atmospheric conditions, solar activity and location (inside/outside, type of building or environment, inner city, ""out in the sticks"", etc.) and I was probably receiving during the best of these conditions. But compared to the other portables I have used, it is clearly a winner, at least using the built in whip and at least so far. I hope it proves to be reliable.\n\nUPDATE 2/15/2010\n\nI strung a longwire antenna in my backyard between trees and connected to my 7600GR. I was able to get 75 feet of length, but I could only get it up about 12 feet high and it is pretty close to my house. I can get all of the stations I was able to get during my walks with good signal, but the longer bandwiths (lower frequencies) are noisier than during my walks. None the less, reception is great and I've been able to listen in on lot's of ham conversations, mostly around 3900kHz, on LSB. The SSB tuning is a bit touchy, but it works great.";I'm AMAZED

Tuning the radio is another problem since it doesn't have a knob, only buttons. The Kaito 1103 is a superior radio because of these features and matches the performance of the Sony except maybe for bringing in distant AM stations. It also costs less.

These two radios are the pinnacle of portable shortwave radio design but are now difficult to find new.  Both have the Synch Detector but at a much higher price than the 7600GR.  Couple the 7600GR with Sony's AN-LP1 antenna and you come surprisingly close to the performance of the SW07 & SW100.  The 7600GR with the AN-LP1 antenna will blow away any competitor in the portable shortwave radio catagory available new today.  Futhermore, the 7600GR performance on Longwave & Mediumwave (AM) are superb for such a small radio.  The stereo audio on FM through a quality set of headphones is excellent.\n\nIn regards to a comment about the operation of the 7600GR and its ergonomics, the person either didn't read the manual and/or knows very little about shortwave reception.  Having the best tool in your hands doesn't make you an expert until you learn how to use it.  And the 7600GR is the most useful and simple portable shortwave radio I have ever used in my 30+ years in this hobby.  Get one while they are still available.  You will never regret it!;The Only Portable Shortwave Radio Available With Synch Detector
104;43.0;4.0;16.0;I owned this general coverage receiver for 9 months. It is high quality. It is full of features crammed in the smallest possible package for portability. The sound is good. The AM/SW reception is much better compared to my older 9 band analog Sony shortwave receiver ICF-4920. I must add that the sound coming from the smaller speaker in the older ICF-4920 is more impressive. Anyway, the 7600GR's FM reception is outstanding. In thick walled buildings, I recommend using the spool antenna, that is included with the radio, for improved FM reception. The first thing I did after I acquired the 7600GR was to get a good 120V wall adapter for continuous use. Knowing the available adapter was inadequate for clear reception, I snatched a discontinued Sony AC-E60L adapter, which supplies 6V DC at 650mA, and works well with the 7600GR. Alkaline batteries do not last very long in the 7600GR.\n\nAfter about 7 months of service, the LCD display began to fade, so I had to return the 7600GR to Sony for an exchange under warranty. Sony handled the exchange very professionally and gave me a like-new refurbished unit with 90 day warranty. So far, I have had no problems with the exchange unit, and the LCD display is much more easier to read than the original unit.\n\nIn conclusion, the 7600GR is a very nice travel companion. Sony service is also outstanding in the way it handled the product defect. I would have given this product 5 stars, if the defect did not arise, for I have NEVER had problems with the Sony products I already own.;A portable receiver packed with the most features available.
15;44.0;5.0;7.0;"A superb but older model receiver, I love it, being an older model myself. Reminds me of the Sony 2010. Probably among the best available and still Sony quality made in Japan. I don't mind not having a tuning knob at all, the up down buttons are fine. If it's there, you'll probably hear it.\n\nThe station capture feature on shortwave is the best in the industry; you can hear it go out and grab the frequency for you! In contrast, similar circuitry from other manufacturers sort of invite the signal in if it wants to. I think Sony has the major patent on this circuit.";Excellent Japanese Receiver
89;45.0;1.0;15.0;I purchased this radio with high expectations, but was soon disappointed!\n\nIt looked great, sounded good,.....but! But soemtimes I just want to grab a radio and putz around with it. The problem I had was CHANGING the damn stations. I don't have time to go through all those presets, buttons, (and directions!) to figure out how to change the channels. I'll take analogue\n\nany day just to get a simple dial to turn the stations with. SONY take a clue, include a dial just to change stations....Americans don't have all that patience to go through hoops to just change the channel!;Station changer PAIN
17;46.0;5.0;7.0;Something of a classic in the world of portable shortwave receivers.  Still made in Japan with a metal case.  Has a very solid feel to it.  A bit of a learning curve to use all its features, so keep the manual handy.  Bought one several years ago and decided to buy this as a backup.  Always rumors of Sony ceasing production of this receiver, buy one now while they are still available.  You won't be disappointed.  Great at receiving shortwave signals and pulling in distant AM stations.  Comes with nice, soft case.  AC-DC adapter available from Universal Radio.;Classic Portable Shortwave Receiver
38;47.0;5.0;10.0;I found this Sony portable shortwave radio when my old Radio Shack radio quit after 20+ years and everything Radio Shack has now is made in China. I do not buy things made in China. The Sony is an excellent product made in Japan. The shortwave reception is very good and I can tune in more stations than before. It even comes with an external antenna but I have not used that. It takes time for me to get accustomed to the input buttons which have multiple functions depending on the current operational mode. The real drawback is that there is no AC adapter and due to a different connector size, I cannot use the adapter from the previous radio.;Best Portable Shortwave Receiver
0;48.0;5.0;16.0;This is a terrific value.  Very sensitive on shortwave and mediumwave (I don't use it for FM), built like a tank, good on batteries.  It is conveniently small, and although its speaker won't fill a concert hall, it's an excellent speaker for its small size.  Fine home and travel radio, even if that's travelling around the house or yard.  The only better portable shortwave receiver out there is the Grundig Satellit 800, which costs three times as much and is the size of a tank.;Sensitive, selective, reliable and durable radio
41;49.0;1.0;11.0;Very disappointing after reading the reviews here. I got zero SW reception on any band even with the extended antenna. MW and FM were very poor. Either I got a defective unit or the item isn't worth the price of purchase. The item was returned.;Very disappointing
42;50.0;1.0;11.0;My radio quickly developed problems in the volume control - one of the few non-digital parts - but too late to qualify for warranty repair.\n\nAt this price level, Sony should increase its warranty and improve quality control.\n\nI would not buy another.\n\nUpdate: The antenna has now come off, and the volume control not longer functions.;Sony's Weak Point
21;51.0;5.0;7.0;This is my second ICF-SW7600GR radio. The first one I bought for use at my weekend cabin where I don't have TV or even telephone for internet, so I use the Sony to listen to baseball and football games during the day, and surf mostly the ham bands at night. That one stays at the cabin, so when I got the bug to listen to shortwave and ham at home, I decided to order a second. I did review all the mostly Chinese options, and they certainly have some very nice features, but when it came to making a decision, I decided that the classic, very reliable, decades-old design of the made in Japan Sony was worth the few sacrifices in features. Very glad I decided on a second Sony. It just works really well. The audio is not hifi quality, but plenty good enough for talk radio, sports and tuning in SW at night. Yes, a set of decent headphones work wonders at helping pull out those distant signals from all the electronic muck we are surrounded by. I find the SSB tuning to be excellent, the sync lock really grabs and holds a MW signal, and the antenna attenuator very useful when a local station starts to overload the sensitive receiver circuit. I do wish the signal didn't mute during scan, but other than that I can't find a lot to complain about. If you are looking for a reliable AM/FM radio with the additional fun of listening to the whole world on SW and SSB, you won't make a bad choice by purchasing this Sony.;Classic design, highly functional, solid Sony quality AM/FM/SW/SSB radio.
117;52.0;5.0;15.0;My search is finally over for a radio with perfect A.M. reception. I get a lot of the weak stations, and without static.\n\nThe  sync lock also helps in areas with heavy interference. The battery life is excellent! I made it over a week on one set of batteries! The F.M. and shortwave are also nice. I also like the fact that you can fall asleep to one station and wake to another.\n\nThis is one of the best portables out there!;Great Portable With Excellant A.M. Reception And Great Battery Life!
118;53.0;3.0;15.0;Radio works ok, but isn't quite as sensative as I would of liked.  I had a cheapie Magnavox Ae3805 before, and in honesty so far I haven't tuned in anything on this radio I couldn't get previously.  Doesn't quite have the sensativity without the external antenna to pick up distant ham transmissions,etc.  And for some reason Sony reccommends strongly you only use their amplified AN1 something or other external antenna, and not just a longwire antenna hooked to a phono jack which is what I wanted to do.  Apparently the external antenna jack puts out an actual voltage onto the external antenna, and you may(?) damage the radio if you just use a longwire homebrew antenna?\n\nI don't know, but that was a pretty big turnoff.\n\nThe radio's backlight could of been brighter, and I found I do miss the tuning knob alot more then I thought I would, being restricted to only direct frequency entry or the use of scan buttons.  It's not bad for a portable radio, but its not as good as I would of liked and perhaps I should of done more comparison and reading before I bought the radio.;Radio is ok, but not great
127;54.0;4.0;15.0;If you order this radio, Be advised that the AC adapter is not included, if you read the discription you are lead to believe that the AC adapter is included. 1st impressions with the receiver, it appears to be fairly easy to operate, I immediately began using without referencing the manual, and was finding short wave stations almost immediately, only knock, is it is a bit overpriced.;AC adapter **not included
1;55.0;5.0;15.0;This is an excellent radio for the price. I have owned it now for almost a month and have been very pleased with its performance. Reception is good, and I have been able to pick up a number of stations around the globe very easily (bear in mind this is short wave radio we are talking about, don't expect the same type of reception you get from FM!). I like the digital tuner, as I don't get the drift that I get from my other short wave with analog tuning. The size of the radio makes it easy to carry around whereever you go. An added bonus (at least in mine) was the external antenna that was included in the box.;Excellent Radio for the Price
116;56.0;5.0;14.0;For many years I enjoyed my Sony ICF 2010 before switching to the newer technology - Sony ICF-SW7600GR. Both have similar functionality and meter bands but ICF-SW7600GR is a large step forward. First, it's much more compact and much lighter. Second, its reception is better and cleaner. Even for FM band, what is non existant for ICF 2010 sounds clear and stable with ICF-SW7600GR. The same applies to MW band. Unlike the former Sony, with the ICF-SW7600GR one can enjoy FM stereo broadcasting (using headphones.) It is amazing how in that small box Sony was able to put an excellent PLL Synthesized Receiver.;Sony Engineering at Its Best
68;57.0;5.0;12.0;This is a stellar product and appears to be Sony's swansong in the shortwave radio arena. I just checked their website and this is the ONLY SWL radio model they have left on offer. This is sad since they have always been known as one of the power players in this arena and used to have many models - all of them raved about in their respective size and price categories.\n\nThis unit is near perfect. The body is built like a tank and should last many years if you treat the whip antenna with respect (all whips on all radios need this respect). Radio experts call this the most bang for your buck radio in its category.\n\nIf you want a shortwave/AM/FM portable radio built by a manufacturer who truly knows how to make 'em, this is your last chance. Seriously. This is still Made in Japan (not China!!!!)\n\nIf you don't like it, many many people will buy it on eBay.\n\nI also recommend you purchase rechargable batteries/charger. I got Sony's own quick battery charger (comes with 4 AA batteries) and one extra set of 4 AA batteries.\n\nThen go to eBay and purchase a Sony AN-LP1 from buyfromjapan - this light weight active antenna is virtually made for this radio and is no longer obtainable here in the USA. This eBay seller sells them brand new. I bought mine from him and it is shipped almost immediately. You'll have it in days.\n\nAdd your own choice of earbuds/headphones if you want to enjoy stereo FM.\n\nYou will then have the perfect little radio obtainable with all the most perfect added components in my opinion. With care, all this should last you at least a decade or more of high quality useage.\n\nIf you are still in doubt, I suggest you join the Yahoo group for this radio as they are very friendly and have many many knowledgable members who have a wide background and experience in all the other possible choices so can give you a balanced opinion. Many prefer other radios for different usages and use various radios for this reason.\n\nADDENDUM 10/17/08:\n\n[...]\n\nThe above is a pointer to a 2007 review of this radio in comparison to 3 others in its price range by Monitoring Times, a respected communications device magazine (radios, scanners, antennas, etc.);Buy ASAP - Last of Sony's Shortwave Offerings
69;58.0;3.0;12.0;While this radio is very good, beware of Sony Service and also that Sony will use defective parts in its products and then 'run out of replacements' to fix their problems.  Capacitors that leak all over the circuit board, etc., rendering the product inoperative.  Bottom line: when you buy a Sony radio (and maybe other Sony products) and carry it out of the store, don't expect Sony to stand behind that product that you spent good money for for more than a few months.  Instead, expect Sony to tell you to 'send it in' for repair and then they leave you hanging for weeks, and if you finally get curious and ask them where your service request is, for them to tell you nicely that they no longer have the PARTS to fix whatever it is you sent them.  This is Sony's way of telling you to 'buy another one.'  Sony does NOT stand behind the products, their life cycle is 6 months, and after that, parts not available.  But, Sony will be happy to have you go to the trouble to spend shipping money to send them your product and let it disappear into the Sony US Service black hole until you contact them to ask 'where is it?'  Sony does not deserve your hard earned dollar.  Again, once you buy a Sony, forget service after the sale---they could care less.  Sony's quality is terrible.  Don't spend your money on Sony unless you like repeat buying over and over again.  Obsolete is what they sell and they don't service it.  So plan to throw your unit away if it fails, don't waste your time with Sony service.;A great radio.  But: beware of Sony service and Sony design
61;59.0;1.0;11.0;I purchased this radio primarily for AM and FM listening.  I guess I should have just stuck with a basic radio without all of the bells-&-whistles.  This was definitely OVERKILL for my needs.\nI have been very disappointed with the reception of this radio for simple AM & FM stations in my area.  The radio fades in-and-out on all but very, very local FM stations. I cannot reach any FM stations further than about 10 miles while my other very small transistor has been much more successful in reaching those same stations at about 1/4 of the price of this unit.\nI have always been happy with all of my Sony products until now.;OverKill
115;60.0;5.0;13.0;I've owned about 20 different portable and desktop general coverage receivers in the past 11 years. Most of the tabletop models will perform better then any portable radio. But only a few portables come even close to a true communication receiver.\n\nThis radio is one of them, also the Sony 2010, Sangean 909, Radio Shack 398 and the old Sangean 803. But that's about it. I listen mostly to SSB such as hams, Overseas aviation and marine communications. The SW7600GR will hear 90% of what my Communication receivers hear. I won't sound as good on it's small speaker but most signals are there. I remember a few years ago listing to the US Coast Guard on HF searching for a downed flight in the Pacific on my Sony 2010 and watching the news on TV at the same time. This little radio will perform just as well as the 2010 and will do it for less then half of the cost of the 2010's new price. As for SW AM broastcast bands check the other reviews for those. Buy one if you can find one you won't be disappointed. I own 2 of them!;One of the best portable HF radios!
27;61.0;5.0;7.0;I was confused as to whether or not an external antenna was included in the box with this radio.  The product description, and even Sony's own web site, are ambiguous on the subject.  Several optional external SW antennas are among the items that Amazon customers frequently purchase with this radio.\n\nFor the record, there IS an external antenna in the box, and you do NOT need to purchase the Sangean (or any other) external antenna.;No Optional SW Antenna Needed
14;62.0;5.0;5.0;I see why after all these years this radio has been in production, why it still receives high marks and praise especially from HAM's. and can easily hold its own against more newer shortwave portables. She may not have all the bells and whistles of the newer portables, but this girl performs  very well on shortwave and SSB modes. medium wave and FM seem ok but I primarily listen to shortwave. and TBH I don't even miss a tuning wheel( one less thing to wear out and that turned me off of some of the other Brands and  other newer models with breakdowns). Also a tuning meter to me isn't needed and on most portables I have found its at best a tuning guide. After reading the instructions and playing with the radio, the functions seem intuitive now after just one day of use.\nIt comes with NO batteries or a/c adaptor. and a little secret  I  learned the hard way, for me I never use a adaptor just use rechargeable batteries, also cuts down on noise and you don't ever have to worry about a rechargeable battery swelling or leaking.\nGet it while they still make these radios, quality seems very high and built like a tank.;Sony ICF-SW7600GR.. Still holds its own as a quality Portable Radio
90;63.0;5.0;12.0;"I purchased the radio just before leaving the USA to explore Honduras for several months. My observations regarding the radio's performance are from this journey.\n\nSENSITIVITY:\n\n  Rural reception; very quiet man-made RF overload environments will  challenge the external antenna possibilities, especially, when atmospheric noise contributions are very low.\n\n  Urban reception; very high RF overload environments (Tegucigalpa and even some locations here in La Esperanza, Honduras) reception of weak signals is\n\nimpossible. The attenuation control for the antenna input level is very useful if using the scanning mode; especially when local AM, FM, and TV stations plus other RF sources are producing RF overloading. Good sensitivity is demonstrated by the harmonics that are received form nearby TV receiver horizontal sweep oscillators (15,750 Hz).\n\nSELECTIVITY: By compromising signal strength, ie. tuning, and beat frequency oscillator factors when using single side band modes to reduce adjacent frequency interference for AM signal reception; selectivity is adequate and improved.\n\nERGONOMICS: Multiple use functions for some buttons increases the learning curve, especially in the dark. Separation of the number selection buttons from the other multi-function buttons would be an improvement.\n\nENERGY EFFICIENCY: The receiver dead battery indication is accurate. My test for this was to remove the batteries from the radio after the dead battery indication appeared and inserting them in a bicycle incandescent lamp to check for any remaining power. In complete darkness no light could be detected. In a LED lamp the batteries would produce light. When I experimented with batteries from the bike lamp which was indicating weak batteries, and inserted them into the radio, I was able to listen on the\n\nresidual energy for a fair length of time.\n\nOVERALL: A good mix of performance characteristics for the price.";SONY ICF-SW7600GR
72;64.0;5.0;11.0;"The Sony 7600GR shines most brightly in the realm of true SW portable radios, top of the pyramid. Only the Eton/Grundig E5/G5, and perhaps the Kaito 1103 are close, but the latter has seriously flawed ergonomics.\n\nFirst off, the Sony is just the right size, that is small enough to carry with you anywhere, even during extended airline travel, but large enough that its controls are widely-spaced and easily accessible. I also own the G5, but find it too small to handle without accidentally pushing some control,  and its buttons too small and tightly-packed. In terms of performance, I get consistently stronger signals with less hiss/noise on the Sony vis a viz the G5; also, the Sony enjoys superior signal strength boosts with the use of a modest external antenna (clearer, cleaner signal with less hiss than the G5). Moreover, the 7600 has synchronous detection to lock in weak signals (the G5 does not), though I have to say I haven't really noticed much of a difference when using it. The Sony divides the single sideband into USB and LSB while the G5 does not; hence, SSB reception was MUCH better on the Sony: many more pickups, clearer signals. However, I'd say that the G5 has a somewhat richer, fuller sound than does the Sony, though it's hardly a night-day difference, But it's there, the Sony having a slightly tinnier, sharper, more ""glassy"" sound, a drawback obviated by the use of headphones.\n\nI find the Sony much easier to navigate than the G5 where you seem to be constantly pushing buttons to get around from band to band, freqeuncy to frequency, and the memory buttons are tiny (and require concentrated focus to hit) compared with the big, round, widely-spaced buttons on the 7600 where you can hold the right side and easily punch in changes with your thumb. However, the G5 does have a tuning wheel which is a semi-major flaw in the Sony, though with its 1Khz tuning buttons, you have the same measure of precise control. Still, the tuning knob is unquestionably the best band scanning device.\n\nAM reception and FM reception, for me, are slightly better on the Sony, though the difference is slight. On the SW bands, I much prefer the signal strength and low background hiss/noise on the 7600 compared with the G5, especially enjoying noticably stronger signals when using an outdoor-mounted slinky (which seems to inject mainly hiss into the G5). If signal strength for a SW frequency is, say, 3 or 3+ (out of 5) on the Sony, it's generally 3- or so on the G5.\n\nAs for build quality, the 7600's heft, feel, general overall qualilty of solidity and sturdiness exceed those of the G5. That is, other than the whip antenna anchor which is really loose, almost flimsy. So far, it's held up, but I am always aware of its wobbly base when manipulating the antenna.\n\nNow I live on the west coast, the worst place in the country for SW reception, so the experiences of listeners in more lively zones may be wholly different. But for me, after using both radios regularly and doing numerous head-to-head comparisons over about 6 weeks, the Sony is the hands-down winner. The G5 is a good, even very good, SW portable but the Sony is a near-great one.\n\nOne suggestion I have is this: If you buy a 7600GR (or even a G5, or some similar-sized portable), go to Universal Radio's Web site ([...]) and order one of their clear plastic radio stands which holds your radio firmly in place and at an ideal viewing angle. It's about 7"" wide and costs about 7 bucks. Makes SWLing much easier. I have no connection to this company, but think this is a tip worth passing on.\n\nPostscript 3/28. Just read the review below mine, re AM reception. Not my experience at all. My 7600GR picks up at least 20 AM stations with hiss-free clarity, ""5"" on a 1-5 scale. I even get KNBR in San Francisco, 600 miles to the South and some AM station in Calgary at level 4. AM reception is really powerful on mine.";The Best, Period.
22;65.0;5.0;6.0;I am very happy with this portable radio. For FM reception locally you can't beat it. Lousy splatter from local country FM station is muted via the attenuation function this radio has, so I can hear the 10 watt (yes, PBS repeater) station adjacent to it. AM is fine. Fidelity via speaker is decent and through stereo headphones excellent. I get little added value in SW reception from the included clip-on wire antenna. I think you need to spring for a plug in antenna (the plug is there on this radio but that antenna is not included). I get SW pretty much every night from Europe and Nova Scotia (they re-transmit some Asian stations from there). I am in PA and cannot get any Pacific stations at any time on this radio, nor any Middle East (I have ham radio rig with a long wire antenna and get both on that one---but that's another league). This has been a very high quality radio. I use it with longer-life rechargeable and they last a fairly long time (about an hour or two at a time and they last weeks). It is on the heavy side. You do need to read the book on this one....a lot of functions and they are not all intuitive. This is the same as most new radios, though.\nThe SSB function is kind of unusual for a portable. Allows you to listen to ham radio and some military stuff. This radio has pretty wide reception---much wider than the typical SW areas. I have been very happy with it for a few years now. High quality radio and Made in Japan (which, anymore, is an indication of pretty good quality).;Used it for a few years now
111;66.0;4.0;12.0;I bought this to replace a Panasonic RF B33, which had seen sterling service for many years. The bottom line is that it is a great radio. Sound quality is good, construction is rugged, features are second to none in this price range.\n\nThe only thing stopping me from giving it a 5 are a couple of small useability issues. First, why has the 'alarm' function been renamed 'timer standby memory'? Come on. Why obfuscate setting an alarm. It's not too difficult to work it out, and the manual is ok, but why?? Secondly, battery life is not great, and the backup time while you're changing batteries is not very long (a few minutes). While that's enough to change batteries, if you leave it without batteries for more than a few minutes you loose all the settings. There's no real excuse for that these days.\n\nBottom line is that I highly recommend this radio. Just a couple of tweeks from Sony would make it perfect.;A great radio, let down by a couple of small flaws
113;67.0;2.0;12.0;I just received my Sony radio today.  I am very disappointed with the product.  I own two similar radios, the Sangean 909 ATS and a Grundig YB 400 PE.  When I bought these radios, it included an AC adaptor.  Sony appears to be too cheap to include it.  Set up is not easy.  It does appear to be built well.  Sony had better make it easier to use when you turn it on for the first time.  Setting the clock is very complicated, not easy like the Sangean or Grundig radios.;Disappointing

At this point I will take any U.S. station, anywhere.  After spending two hours with Sony tech support, they couldn't get it to work by connecting anywhere else in the U.S.  The 7600GR will only connect to other Hawaii AM/FM stations which a mere $10 radio can do anyhow.

108;72.0;4.0;11.0;"Nice radio for size. Good battery life, and set feels ""solid"" . Shortwave reception, as opposed to what some others have said, does not seem too insensitive to weak signals. The synchronous detection circuit works well to decrease fading of signals. The frequency response of the speaker is not too bad at all, and is not ""tiring"" to listen to for long periods, as what some other reviews have noted. I am using a Radio Shack 6 VDC AC adapter, and works well with little if any hum audible, even on weaker signals. Sure, many of the controls are on the side, but in keeping the radio small enough for travel and such, to place more of these controls on the front panel would negate the portability of this radio, so even this design of the radio would not be a glaring negative.

Bear in mind it does not come with an AC adapter so you've got to cough up another fifteen bucks if you don't want to always replace batteries. With the adapter, the SW7600 costs well over 160 dollars, not small change for a radio that comes with a little tin speaker. For seventy dollars less and equal sensitivity and performance, you can get the Kaito 1103, which by the way comes with an AC adapter at no extra charge. In fact, the Kaito 1103 actually gets better FM. At the high price point of the Sony, I suggest you try the less expensive Kaito 1103.\n\nUpdate 4-5-07: If you don't mind a slightly larger radio, you will get better sound and sensitivity with the Kaito 2100, a rebadged Redsun.

96;74.0;2.0;10.0;The radio gets GREAT reception.  The reason I rated it so low is because of the scanning feature.\n\nWhen you try to scan to listen to ANY shortwave band, it will only scan the band and not all availible channels.  Trying to guess the band number to start with is a real pain.  For this reason alone, I would not buy this radio again (actualy I trying to sell it on Ebay).;It's okay
101;75.0;5.0;10.0;I researched this radio quite a bit before buying, and it generally had great reviews, and I can totally agree. It has great reception, especially with the synchronous lock feature, and it's very easy to use. The owner's manual is very good and well written and organized, a big plus.\n\n  Having read about quality issues with some of it's competitors, I was very pleased with the fit, finish, and overall quality of this unit. One very major selling point for me was the fact that it's still made in Japan, which I personally believe is an important factor in the quality issue.\n\n  For me, the only real drawback to this radio is the lack of a tuning knob, I do actually miss that somewhat. All tuning is done via buttons, but they are all well placed and have a very nice feel to them. The backlight for the LCD screen could be a bit brighter, but it's not bad.\n\n  I would highly recommend this radio to someone looking for a nice, compact portable, that has great reception, good sound, and is very well made. Five stars for sure!;Great portable radio!
102;76.0;4.0;10.0;AMAZING !!!!\n\nThanks to the previous review posters on this Sony ICF-SW7600GR receiver.\n\nWith a broad-spectrum coverage, light on sucking battery power, a BFO for SSB, FM stereo,\n\nand most important.... the synchronous detection.\n\nWhen the Sync-Lock kicks in, .... you will enjoy AM again.\n\nAmazon dot com had the best purchase price and a seamless delivery.\n\nCareful .... the radio feels a bit fragile.;AMAZING  ! ! ! !
24;77.0;5.0;5.0;Sorry for my bad english, my mother tongue is german.\n\nIts a nice piece of Japan engineering, i have all the pre models here in use and that Model is a good successor of all which was in row before.\n\nThe SW7600GR  has an very sensitive receiver for shortwave and a clear and good reception for FM.\n\nThe additonal antenna for Shortwave is a good and easy way to improve the reception on SW.;Perfect machine
32;78.0;5.0;6.0;"Quality radio! SSB is great! Listening to ham transmissions as I type. Sync Det works well. The unit is a joy to use and handel.\nYou cant go wrong with this kit.  you will enjoy it!\n\nTo the reviewer who says ""dont make the hundred dollar mistake"" is kidding himself and readers. You are not going to find a radio with SSB and Sync detection for under 100 bucks. You get what you pay for. The Tecsun pl 660 looks like a good unit with similar features if you want to save a few bucks.\nenjoy surfing the shortwave bands!\n\n**Update I ended up purchasing the PL 660 as well as the Sony (for backup, plus I like radios.)\nCouple of things I've noticed about the Tecsun:\n\n-The tuning wheel is nice but the novelty quickly wears off. Plus if you are handling the radio you will definately bump the wheel and switch stations. Happens almost every time. It is very annoying!!\n\n-The sync detection works much better on the Sony. The Tecsun's sync is less effective and makes a LOUD squeal when it loses its ""lock"" and another loud squeal when it finally ""locks"" back in.\n\n-2000 channel memory is overkill, never going to use it. Plus it's not as intuitive as the Sony's memory interface.\n\n-Build quality is good on the 660 but the Sony has the edge for sure.\n\n-Buttons on the 660 are recessed making them hard to find and requires deliberate pressure.\n\n-The 660 has a built in charger and comes with batteries. However, the supplied batteries only have a 1000mah capacity so they don't last long. The unit's ability to charge the batteries internally is a great concept but in reality, charging batteries in series will not give each cell an even charge. If you want to use rechargables and do it right, you will need to invest in a set of Eneloops and a good smart charger.\n\nI hope this helps in your decision if you are chosing between the 2. I am not loyal to Sony in any way, but if I had to choose between the two, I would pick the Sony by a large margine";Portable shortwave standard
25;79.0;4.0;5.0;To the only issue with this radio. The noise when using a A/C adapter. Sony in it's enduring wisdom discontinued adapter AC-E60HG\nand the only one they manufacture that fits this model  ( AC E60A ) creates interference on the am/ shortwave bands. Now for the fun part You can Google the correct one and maybe find a used one on ebay OR you can go to this link .\n\n[...]\n\nJust in case amazon is upset about links to 3rd party websites I think googling universal radio mw 41-680 will get you to a adapter that will work . I have not purchased a adapter from there yet but they seem pretty confident it works .This is a great radio and sony's decision to discontinue the noiseless adapter is just another in a long line of sony misses in recent years .get all the good radios that you can.;I'll get right to the point
26;80.0;5.0;5.0;"This is the natural evolution of the '7600 series.  I miss the tuning knob on my old '7600A, but the frequency display on this version stays in calibration and is probably more reliable.  The scanning functions work well and help make up for the loss of the knob.  Synchronous detection feature works better than on my $700 Icom receiver!\n\nAnother reviewer mentioned that his SW7600GR didn't work well in hotel rooms.  I have also found this to be true, but the reason is the high level of RF interference present in most hotels.  There are probably hundreds of TV sets in the average hotel, each with its own ""always-on"" switching power supply.  Even my little cell phone charger blankets the shortwave spectrum with hash when it's plugged in!  The solution is to take the receiver outside if you can.\n\nFM works great, and is in stereo through the headphone jack.";The Classic Sony Portable
120;81.0;4.0;10.0;Sounds like a good product, but wonder if the an-lp1 powered antenna is really necessary. The Sony website sell it for $100. That's nearly two thirds the price of the radio itself! Any of the audio engineers out there have a less expensive suggestion?;Expensive antenna
94;82.0;5.0;9.0;Just like every other review about this radio.  It's packed with all the features that listeners need to have like PLL tuning, direct keypad frequency entry, scan tuning, memories tuning, LCD backlid,....and the powerful Synchronous Detection Circuit.  This AM mode feature would LOWER the distortion due to fading from weak receptions and EXTRACT the adjacent broadcast stations to get a clear/better reception, using the SYNC mode and either LSB/USB switch.\n\nEX: I am listening to Voice of Vietnam at 6175 kHz, using a Kaito KA2100 or the Mini Kaito KA11. Sometimes I'd get a clear reception, but most of the time I have a mixing reception with beats, and the 2 adjacent stations are the Radio Netherland at 6165 kHz and the Radio Havanna Cuba at 6180 kHz.  These 2 stations are so strong to interfere the reception of the Voice of Vietnam station even if they are not tuned in on the display, and even if I use PLL tuning (no drifting). Now, With the Sync Detection feature on the Sony 7600GR, I can easily eliminate those interferences by switching to Sync and LSB or USB, and I can enjoy listening again.\n\nWay to go, Sony!!;Very Good!!!
43;83.0;5.0;7.0;He estado detrs de este radio durante mucho tiempo.  Tengo un Grundig S350DL y un Sony SW35 pero el 7600GR es absolutamente superior.  Originalmente japons, excelente calidad.  Ciertamente el parlante no da un gran sonido pero generalmente lo uso con audfonos. Ahora puedo escuchar las bandas de radioaficionados con gran xito.  Es un radio completo.;Best Shortwave Radio
44;84.0;2.0;7.0;I bought this unit to replace my existing Radio Shack RX-396 (almost the same size as 7600gr) which is approx. 8 years old.  I picked SONY because of many good reviews especially those from experienced shortwave listeners.  After receiving the shipment, I made comparison between SONY 7600gr and my existing RX-396 and found that the SONY's shortwave reception is decidedly inferior to RX-396. Comparison were made under the exact same conditions.  I have also read the Sony's instruction book very carefully and tried every possible techniques on the book.  But none helped.  So it is either (a) those folks giving rave reviews on 7600gr were testing some earlier (hence better) product, OR (b) my RX-396 is a too well designed/built product to be topped.;Shortwave reception is disappointing
39;85.0;4.0;6.0;"Bought this sony as a backup for my first one, use it exclusively for the SSB, wx reports that I need in the bahamas, for this puropse it works well, though with all AM broadcasts some days are better than others - in my case I received perhaps 1/2 of Chris Parkers morning SSB weather reports, using the included wire antenna clipped to the regular antenna on the radio.  Four years later I was determined to improve my reception.  With much internet searching I discovered a very old antenna type, known as an AM loop antenna.  In brief, I took the lid of a surplus tough plastic storage bin, wrapped 27' of 24/2 wire (speaker wire) around and around the outside of the lid, with little drilled holes every 4-6"" i used plastic zip ties to attach the wire, then i cut out the inside of the box lid (better for resisting strong winds when hung outside), put two quick attachment clips on the top two corners (for hanging up in open air), dead ended one end on the box lid and sealed them with a but wire connector (red size) and put silicone in the gaps to make it weather tight (note the dead end is NOT connected to each other or anything else, then i left enough of a lead free to feed it down into my boat (6'/2m approx), attached two small alligator clips to the other end of the 27' wire, on my boat one goes to the end of the antenna wip and one goes to a good ground (on a steel boat, just clip to any part of the hull - cleaned back to bare steel on a fiberglass boat you may be able to connect to your boat's 12v ground or a keel bolt - use a wire extension for this, because 27' must be used for the antenna, in a house - connect to a water pipe - if copper and cleaned to bare copper, again use a wire extension to reach the pipe DO NOT CONNECT to any part of your house's 120vac electrical system or your listening experience could have much more of a BUZZZZZ than you are prepared for!  So a few things i've learned about this:  an am loop antenna is basically a long wire antenna wrapped around and around - the shape apparently doesn't make much difference but something at least a foot+ x two feet seems to work (hence the lid from a plastic storage bin - non conductive and in my case FREE - god i love that word, second the ground wire is critical as are good quality electrical connections - in the marine environment (salt water corrodes - don't you know) you will have to use marine grade wire and connectors and even then they'll need to be redone occassionaly to maintain the best possible reception, third you must eliminate all possible sources of radio interference if you want good AM/shortwave/SSB reception, some very bad sources of bad reception include computers, cell phones, ipods, low draw lights (leds) - you get the idea, keep turning stuff off untill you get good reception, start with a signal you're certain to pick up and move on to more challenging stuff.\n\nVery well built radio (completely built in JAPAN) getting rarer and rarer as even SONY is offshoring their manufacturing and it's just not as good.\n\nOne last hint, get a good pair of full headphones (closed ear type - not buds) they really make a huge difference - mine cost only $8 bucks at a discount department store, i couldn't find nice fancy ones, and was amazed that all it took was the $8 dollar ones to allow loud and clear reception!\n\nlastly got my best price from amazon, and it's not easy to find this little beauty discounted!\n\nchears,\njim aboard SV Pilger northbound from Bahamas to Lake Ontario, Spring 2012";sailor jim
70;86.0;5.0;8.0;So far I am quite impressed with this very high quality am/fm/lw/sw radio which is the cumulative result of Sony research and development over some 25 years. Sony should certainly have provided a similar quality ac/dc adapter/charger that really works well with this unit (with very low interference noise) right at the time of purchase however. A good quality ac/dc adaptor is fortunately still available from the universal-radio website for example. This radio does have a much steeper learning and operating curve for the casual user than for example does the Kaito KA1102. The speaker is somewhat tinny sounding in comparison to the KA1102, but still quite adequate. Also, the variable attenuator controls are extremely excellent compared to the single fixed filters found on some other radios for example. I will update this review as I get further into its daily operations, but so far I am extremely glad that I was able to acquire this very fine radio right now.\n\nUPDATE: June 27, 2008:\n\n  Having built and owned numerous Heathkits as well as Grundig/Eton and Kaito SW radios, I can readily say that this Sony under review is more of a SW radio with FM capability added on whereas the KA1102 is more like an AM/FM radio with SW capability added to it. Part of this description is surely based on the very high quality sound of the KA1102 and the relatively tinny sound from the Sony except through a set of reasonable quality earphones. Most people interested in SW radio listening don't care a great deal about the quality of the radio's musical sounds very much, whereas those who listen to FM a great deal really want high quality musical sounds with full bass and treble adjustments. In addition, however the broad range of listening capabilities on the Sony for reception of LW/AM (MW) and SW bands, all integrate together very nicely as a full package, whereas it seems less connected as an integrated unit on the KA1102. Overall I far prefer the Sony in its SW listening capabilities and very full set of features. Of course the Sony also costs some $70-80 more than the KA1102 too.\n\n  On the negative side, one earlier reviewer on Amazon did note that when the very long telescopic Sony built-in antenna is fully extended it is very vulnerable to breakage and he was completely correct. Sony should have attached either a shorter antenna or reinforced the attachment to the radio for the fully extended position (when extended this antenna is about 20 inches in length). So just to be safe, I don't usually extend the antenna all the way or else I simply attach the supplied external antenna when necessary for improving my SW listening.;Very fine quality as well as highly portable sw radio
74;87.0;5.0;8.0;"I've decided to go ahead and review this product after owning it for 3 years now. I originally purchased the Sony ICF-SW7600GR from Amazon back in 2005 after looking off and on for a small portable shortwave radio for months.\n\nI'm not an expert in shortwave equipment or a DX nutter. I just wanted a small unit that could get really good reception for not a lot of money. I read many reviews back in 2005 and settled on the Sony. It was a little more than the Grundigs, but right out of the box I was able to get all the shortwave regulars (Havana, China, Japan, Germany, Holland, Vietnam, Italy and in the early hours I even get Australian ABC). Also able to get crystal clear reception on local and regional AM stations and FM stations.\n\nThe speaker isn't going to blow you away, but you get much better sound after plugging in your stereo-capable earphones.\n\nBattery life is superb and there's an easy Sleep Timer near the power button (one touch setting). I never went on the search for an A/C adapter since battery life is exceptional and allows for more ""portability"" . . . since the Sony ICF-SWC7600GR is a ""portable"" radio after all.\n\nThe radio itself is rather small; however, it's built like a tank. It's definitely heavier than it looks. Gives it a solid build feel.\n\nI also use the radio as a receiver for my Sirius satellite plug-n-play system when I have parties at the house. I turn on the satellite radio (which throws off signal to your desired FM frequency) and put the Sony on the back deck in order to simulcast the music around my house.\n\nOverall, if you don't mind spending $120-$150 for a solid, well built SW portable radio, get your hands on this unit before they're no longer available. I'm glad I did.";Very Solid Shortwave Radio
51;88.0;4.0;7.0;"This radio was perfect in every way with one exception.  When I plug in the appropriate AC/DC transformer, the volume stays ""low"" until I push the ""backlight"" button for the display, then it jumps up to a much higher volume.  I did not want to bother with returning it, since it works great otherwise.\n\nP.S\nFor the record, do NOT buy the transformer ""recommended"" as a complimentary item to purchase. It is the wrong voltage.";Don't plan on using a transformer
53;89.0;2.0;7.0;"This is my first negative review on Amazon. The Sony ICF-SW7600GR I purchased from Amazon is a huge disappointment. I could not believe how bad the FM reception is. Only a few stations come in clear, others have interference from nearby stations, or can only be heard if the radio and antenna are held in a specific direction. My Radio Shack clock radio, Tivoli Audio, and any car radio have better reception! Using the SW capabilities are hindered by a user interface that is clumsy and non-intuitive, as others have pointed out. The time is not displayed while the radio is on, unless ""enter"" is pressed, alarms are called ""standby"", the display is too simple and only readable from certain angles, and the many buttons on the side panel are flimsy and poorly labeled.";Not for me
28;90.0;5.0;5.0;"Flip this set over and read ""made in Japan""... now generally means quality. Many Sony products are NOT made in Japan.\nThe product delivers as advertised. A sync detector in a radio under $1,000 + that\nworks properly...BUY  IT ! No tuning knob, who cares, direct tuning takes you there in a flash, quicker than a knob or dial. Get\nover it. Quality is first class, except for the 3 plastic jacks on the left side....would like to have seen steel. The rather small and inadequately lit display is the only real complaint. The light is only effective if you are operating the\nradio in nearly complete darkness. This is not a radio for the casual user/listener. It is one of the most technologically advanced portable sets of its kind, anywhere in the world, as far as I am aware. This radio is the latest iteration of a product that has seen\nnumerous revisions since the beginning of its development in the 1980's. Personally, I do not see anything better for the money in the U.S. market place for portables, at this time. I advise anyone buying this radio to spend a few moments with the well written manual, before turning it on. Also suggest using the lock button after use, and returning it to the nice vinyl case provided. It will prevent accidental turn on, and/or activating alarms...particularly when traveling.  Side benefits will be the protection of this rare radio gem, and run down batteries. Have only owned the radio for about a month. So far no operational problems whatsoever. The very high build quality, and hefty feel contribute positively to my decision to buy this product as having been one of my better decisions. I find sound quality from the speaker as adequate to good. I use ear buds most of the time, listening for distant stations.\nHappy tuning DXers of the world !";Rare gem
29;91.0;5.0;5.0;Don't buy this unless you want world band radio in spades!  This receiver is the best I've owned in the portable variety. I've had my fill of multiple brands looking for stability, sensitivity,, and selectivity.  I hear some noise inside the home but once outside in the clear it does it all.  The noise was due to my many appliances, tv being the worst offender.  Once tuned it locks in and the small speaker sounds large.  Plus hams and ability to switch from USB to LSB is amazingly easy to tune.  It's also very friendly to program, search and scan abilities, and then store all is commendable.  The ease of operation amazes me.  Much better than its Sangean counterpart.  The Sangean is not nearly as sensitive or user friendly.  I'm happy with this little radio.  The included case and reel antenna makes it the best deal out there.  Just buy it. You won't be disappointed.  International broadcasts are now a nightly affair.  The fm stereo and am reception is great. I also wear headphones at night (not included) to not keep the wife awake.  It's the real deal.  Just do it!;Little radio rocks
100;92.0;5.0;8.0;As far as AM radio goes, I've never heard it this clearly before!\n\nThe AM reception is simply amazing.\n\nFM radio of course always comes in perfectly and sounds great.\n\nShortwave reception is wonderful, and you get SSB all for under $150.\n\nI wouldn't even compare this radio to any others in the $200 price range.\n\nLook to spend a bit more on other brands if you're looking for this quality.;Simply awesome
31;93.0;3.0;5.0;It's OK but.....I'm disappointed in the SW performance which was my reason for selecting this model.  The search feature is subpar in my view.  If I had it all to do over I would select a model that used the old method of sliding dial selection.  The digital scan method used here is veg and does not lock on very well so the result is not many stations are picked up.  The FM performance meets all requirements, it locks in and the sound using phones is surperb.  Ditto the local AM selection.  No problem here.  It's only the SW operation that in my view is lacking,;Sony ICF-SW7600GR
34;94.0;2.0;5.0;I suspect this radio gets good reviews from people who have spent the extra money on a well-known brand and don't like to think they made a hundred-dollar mistake. I'm one of those people, and believe me, it was a dumb move.\nThe radio performs adequately--not great, but it does what radios do. So what.\nThe interface is horrendous. You don't control it. You push buttons, trying to remember what all the cryptic little labels mean, and see what happens. It was obviously made by people who understand electronics well but can't design a product that's accessible by those who don't.\nTuning it is like using a slot machine, only with buttons--lots of them--instead of a lever.\nOne of the dumbest things I've ever seen--and there's a lot of 'dumbth' in this thing--is the alarm-clock function. You push a button by mistake and you've turned on the alarm and set it at some random time. The alarm will go off at that time, possibly in the middle of the night. Go ahead and leaf through the book--that's book--of instructions that comes with the thing and try to figure out how to disable the alarm. Go ahead.\nOh, and the antenna lasts about 2 weeks.\nSo go to Radio Shack or Walmart and buy a cheapie. Walk out with an equally good radio and a hundred bucks in your pocket.;way, way overrated
35;95.0;5.0;5.0;I've been using mine since 2001. The synchronous detector works very well, and for the times when it just can't latch onto a really weak signal, you can always tune it in using the selectable single sideband and the fine tuning. No BFO here! The only downsides I can think of are that it only has one bandwidth (though very well chosen with a fairly sharp skirt for a portable), and that the audio doesn't have the greatest fidelity, headphones make a world of difference.\n\nAt the time of this writing, Amazon is selling this receiver for $142, and that's quite a bargain for a receiver that's been working like a champ for me for almost a dozen years. There are other good receivers on the market like the Tecsun PL-660 (which I'm currently evaluating) and the Grundig G3 (about which I've heard good things), but neither has the long history of being a seriously high quality receiver behind it. The SW7600gr came out in 2001 and was just a fairly minor revision of the SW7600g which came out in '94 (my old SW7600g still works like new). Heck, the digital 7600 series goes back to 1983 with the SW7600D / SW2002! (if you're interested there's a site dedicated to the history of the 7600 series. stephan.win31.de/sony7600.htm\n\nAll things considered, this receiver is fantastic for a small portable and has been a workhorse for many years. I doubt any serious SWL would be disappointed with it. Personally, I'm seriously considering getting another as a spare since it's been rumored for years that Sony will be discontinuing this, the last of its great portable shortwave receivers.;Superb small portable receiver.
77;96.0;5.0;7.0;This is a very sensitive and versatile, dual conversion, shortwave radio.  The FM portion is stereo when used with earphones and sounds very good.  The FM band starts below 88 MHz.  This portion of the band can be  used for emergency broadcasting and can receive the audio portion of some TV stations.\n  There is, also a longwave band, a standard broadcast band and 14 shortwave bands all of which can be scanned so that looking for a station is fast and easy.  The 100 memory locations can also be scanned once the presets have been set.  The compact wire antenna that comes with the radio is very helpful at bringing in distant stations. Single sideband stations can also be received.\n  There is also a clock that can show Universal Coordinated Time (or the time in any other part of the world) and local time. There is also an alarm feature with two preset memories.\n  The radio comes with a shortwave radio guide and a soft case for the radio.\n  Do not buy an AC power supply to be used with shortwave. They are very noisy and the program material is drowned out. I have tried various filters and regulators without any improvement in the noise.  The AC power supply can be used with the FM portion, however.  Using rechargeable batteries (4 type AA) is the best way to go for shortwave listening.  Alkaline batteries last between 34 and 47 hours depending on which band is being used.;Fantastic SW Radio
78;97.0;5.0;7.0;Recently, I received a Sony ICF-SW7600GR AM/FM Shortwave radio for Xmas.  I've been an avid shortwave radio listener since the mid-1960s and have had several radios throughout the years.  As my old Radio Shack cassette shortwave radio died, I wrote a letter to Santa and lo and behold I found the Sony under the tree Xmas morning.\n\nThe radio has some nice features like full world band coverage, stereo FM with headphones, nice compact size, good ergonomics, fine memory system, synchronous detector (locks in on stations--a great feature), and ability to handle ham radio broadcasts.\n\nI like the radio very much.  I've spend lots of time playing with it to learn what it can do and I'm generally impressed.  Of course, no radio is perfect and this one does have its warts.\n\nThe worts:\n\n1.  Sound is okay, but just so.  I can live with it, but I'd prefer better fidelity.  A larger speaker would be welcome.  At least I have good headphones.\n\n2.  No rotoary tuning knob, just buttons to change the frequency.  I'm a big fan of weighted rotary tuning knobs.  I wish this radio had one, but the buttons work well as bottons go.\n\n3.  It would be nice if the display light would stay on when tuning.\n\n4.  A signal strength indicator would be welcome.  There is something approximating one, but it is rather lame (but better than nothing).\n\n5.  No band selector--all the LW/MW/SW bands run together.  I got around this by creating presets at the beginning of each meter band for shortwave.\n\nPros:\n\n1.  Compact size.\n\n2.  Features are excellent, especially synchronous detector.\n\n3.  Great ability to handle SSB breadcasts.\n\n4.  Tone switch from voice to music (although voice is usually my perfereed choice).\n\n5.  Line out for recording broadcasts.\n\n6.  Robust build.  This is one well-built attractive radio!\n\n7.  Good documentation and external passive antenna included.\n\n8.  Scanning feature works well.\n\n9.  Fine memory system.\n\nIn conclusion,  this is a fine radio.  This is the best that Sony currently has to offer (in the past Sony was one of the world's best manufacturers of shortwave radios).  Given that Sony's committment to shortwave radio has greatly diminished, like another reviewer, I would recommend that one buy one now before Sony pulls the plug on it.\n\nThe competition is strong and there are better offerings, but one has to pay substantially more.  The similarily priced Grundig G5/Eton E5 is a viable contender, but its lack of sychronous detection would be a deal breaker for many (including, so it seems, Santa).\n\nIt would be lovely to have a table top shortwave receiver, a long antenna strewn about in the backyard, but from a practiable (and portable) standpoint, the Sony ICF-SW7600GR is superb.  I highly recommend this product.;Superb Shortwave Porable Radio
37;98.0;1.0;5.0;For years I owned a Sony 2010 and a couple of years ago decided I wanted something more modern and smaller. So, I bought a new 7600GR based on recommendations on the Internet. Big mistake. This think doesn't even come close to the 2010. I never had to resort to using an external antenna on the 2010 and this thing barely pulls in a ssb signal on 75 meters. Works great on the commercial AM and FM stations but as a short wave receiver it is horrible. Either I got a bad one or those who give this thing 4 stars have never had a decent receiver.;Ain't no 2010!

88;100.0;5.0;7.0;I had a ICF7600 for about 10 years until it finally fell apart.  I replaced it with the 7600GR and enjoy the new features such as the sync detection.  It's not a good as the desktop units costing much much more, naturally.  But I throw it in my briefcase when I go on a trip and it is a great portable radio.  The discounted price from Amazon made the decision even easier.;still a nice unit
55;101.0;5.0;6.0;"My Sony was delivered today so I took time to check out it's features against all the hype about this radio. All I can say is WOW!! This radio is intended for voice and not music so it excels at doing just that! Many reviews downgrade this radio for sound quality and if it was bought for music I can see why. But Sony designed this radio for shortwave use so the sound quality for that is just fine. I like the tone set to ""news"" since it even improves what music I listen to.\n\nIt takes awhile to read the manual (and you DO need the manual) but once that is done this radio is a winner for the shortwave listener like me. I added it to my small collection of Shortwave radios after trying others that just didn't meet my needs due to their small size. This radio is a hunk of shortwave power on the go! It's much heavier than I though it would be but then again it's NOT a pocket radio. For the travel I do this radio will always go along so I can keep up on my Shortwave listen and news outside of the U.S.\n\nI do have one concern that I'll have to be careful of......The antenna mount. On this radio the antenna is very long when fully extended and really gives the joint a real workout if you're holding it. I wrap my index finger of my left hand around the antenna base to support it if I'm holding it and that helps a lot. Being as heavy as this radio is I don't see it as a walkabout radio just moved from place to place which I think is the proper way to use this radio.\n\nOn Balance I see this radio as 4.9 out of 5 with antenna weakness being that missing .1";WOW!! A super radio for shortwave listening.
98;102.0;4.0;7.0;The radio sounds okay but because of it's small size it's a little on the muddy side in sound in the low setting of the tone.  There is no real room for the speaker to resonate.  Headphone usage makes it better.  It gets overloaded very easily with a longer, simple wire for DX'ing the shortwave band.  The attenuater settings does have a pot for adjustment, but the noise from the length of wire and the lack of filtering for this problem is not there.  The sidebands on there are good and the knob on the side of the radio makes it hard to determine where to put it in terms of DX'ing.  It is sweeping the frequencies for different things.  There is no problem picking commercial shortwave radio stations in China, India, Russia,VOA....,(just to point out it's ability to receive distant reach), needs analog type strength meter.  This radio works very well with 2300mA rechargable AA batteries. I used the rechargables with the battery's paired charger.\n\nThe switches for the functions for ssb u/l and sync/norm/ssb are small and for DX'ing it's too stiff and makes the radio less useable. The radio is exellcent in the FM band, as i live near a FM radio transmitter and rejection of that signal is held at bay, so it's image doesn't overide the rest of the band, rock jazz... all sound is very good, crisp and it has good sound reproduction.  For the money this radio was absolutely worth it.  The delivery of the radio was quicker than quick.  I am very happy with my purchase and the whole purchasing process.;Sony ICF-SW7600GR AM/FM Shortwave World Band Receiver with Single Side Band Reception
59;103.0;2.0;6.0;I bought this expecting exellent reception. When I bought this I also bought a Kato shortwave at 25% of the cost. The Kato has a rechargeable battery using a crank and also came with a power supply. The Sony had neither. The topper though is the Kato has better reception. Needless to say Kato stays, Sony goes!;Not as good as reviewed
60;104.0;1.0;6.0;This was a gift for my husband.  We returned it as it was too difficult\nto operate and we got a lot of static when trying to tune in a station.\nI would not recommend this item to anyone.\nHe has since found a Grunig at Radio Shack and is very happy with it.;Don't let the Sony name fool you!
66;105.0;5.0;6.0;"I have had mine for a couple of years now, so I have had ample time to play with it and sort through it's idiosyncrasies. So this review is a bit late in the offing.\n\nI don't know how Sony managed to stuff so many features into such a small package. Well, I do know because the thing must weigh 10 pounds (not really). Seriously though, I have diving weights that are lighter than this radio, it is a real brick. If it becomes necessary to do so, you can wield the thing as a bludgeon, like the old Nikon cameras from the 60's and 70's. So be careful not to drop it on your foot unless you are wearing steel-toes.\n\nThe synchronous selectable sideband feature is GREAT. It actually works and locks on to ""iffy"" signals very solidly, something radios costing 10x+ as much as the Sony still cannot get right. And the single sideband also works fairly well, even if the trimmer pot is a bit touchy, at least on my radio. And 100 presets are nice, although I can never remember what they are since you cannot put any kind of alphanumeric information along with the preset frequency.\n\nOK, things to complain about. MW frequencies stop at 1620 kHz (oops). And it is not possible to do a full-spectrum scan without switching bands. And even then you miss the stuff between the bands unless you know the ""trick"" to make it scan between bands. Compared to my other radios it EATS batteries at a pretty good rate. And there is no really good AC power supply available for the thing which is guaranteed not to hum. There should be some sort of indication on the display that the antenna attenuator is ""On"", that has caused me grief on occasion. And the controls on the sides are damned crowded, but that is only because there are so many features crammed into such a small package. And to get REALLY good SW reception you need to get one of the accessory AN-LP1 active antennas, which are no longer available in the US (oops again). I got mine from a fellow in Japan off of EBay for a very reasonable price (<$100 new in box) with unbelievably fast shipment via EMS, the Japanese post office. The antenna actually shipped faster than the radio, and the radio came from one state away, not halfway around the world.\n\nBut in spite of these minor shortcomings, which are really just annoying idiosyncrasies and not actual faults in the equipment, I give it a good solid 5 stars. You will not find a radio that does as much as well as this one for less than 2-3 times the price.";Excellent radio, especially if you also get the accessory antenna
71;106.0;5.0;6.0;This radio has been a trusty old friend for the past several years. I bought it several years ago when I wanted to start trying out shortwave radio, especially when camping and hiking in remote areas.\n\nSince then, I've purchased numerous new toys like iPods, a satellite radio, and a couple table-top radios.  But I always find myself coming back to using the old, reliable 7600gr.\n\nThe great thing about this radio is its versatility.  In a day and age when electronic gadgets skimp on seemingly unimportant details, this radio has it all.\n\nThe line out is perfect for connecting it to a speaker system, filling my office with great sounding music.\n\nThe attenuator is great for using the radio in interference-riddled environments like offices.  It also helps tremendously in focusing on weak stations that may be overpowered by stronger signals.\n\nThe headphone output on this radio is phenomenal.  I never really appreciated it until I tried using headphones on cheaper radios. Very full sound, clear with music or talk radio.  Try using good full-sized headphones like the Grado sr80's. With top quality FM stations, you can hear deep bass, clear mids, and crisp highs.\n\nThe Standby memory function makes this radio a great travel alarm clock.\n\nShortwave reception has been great for me. I've been able to find lots of interesting stations from around the world.\n\nPresets are easy to use once you get the hang of it.\n\nBatteries last a ridiculously long time.\n\nRugged and reliable. I've camped, hiked, cycled, and ran with this radio, and traveled to Mexico and numerous other places with it. It's been through harsh Canada winters, humid tropical weather, and the occasional rain shower. It still works great. In the same time, two iPods have broken, my first satellite radio broke. But the 7600gr keeps on ticking.\n\nThis radio is versatile.  Use it as a desktop radio, a travel alarm clock, and remote-location shortwave radio.  The only thing it doesn't do well is serve as a pocket radio: It's just too big fit in a pocket. Carry it in a shoulder bag or backpack, and you've got great sounding portable radio.\n\nIf you can get your hands on one of these, get it. It's a classic radio that Sony probably won't ever replicate.;reliable full-featured radio: a modern classic!
73;107.0;1.0;6.0;The radio is dubbed World Band Receiver but mine is only able to tune in local FM stations! I scanned the AM band up and down for hours and days upon  the radio's delivery without it being able to pick up any station at all. It's even worse than my car radio! I hate going through the troubles of returning it, so I simply put it out of sight, hoping for a magic somebody to help wake it up. The accompanying wave book is of little help.;Disappointment!
75;108.0;5.0;6.0;"1. Study existing 5-star review written in 2004 by A W Flones of California;\nhe covers a lot of ground.\n2. Note well that this wonderful Sony does NOT provide an EXternal antenna\njack, which would have been nice. A radio is only as good as its antenna's\nincoming signal, so for a SWL set to omit a passive means to boost signals\nis regrettable. Hardly any portable (or tabletop) sets have external jacks\nfor an antenna, so do not use this as a pretext to ""pass"" on this model.\n3. Once the existing supply (warehouse stock) of Sony ICF-SW7600 sells out,\nyou'll be looking desperately for USED units from questionable sources. In case you actually intend to _use_ a solid SWL portable (at home or away), the 7600 will serve you better than what is produced these days.\nPlease do NOT buy one in case you merely want to add it to your unused collection of trophy radios; there are serious SWLers who can make better use of the dwindling stock (manufacture DISCONTINUED!).\n4. To those of us who are annoyed by SSB ""noise"" when tuning, this radio allows us to actually make sense of what otherwise is an unintelligible signal. Most SWL radios don't ""read"" Single SideBand, but this one does.\n5. Powered by 4xAA.\nBe prepared for emergencies by stocking 8-count (4+4) lithium AA's, sold\nat outrageous prices, but having a ten-year shelf-life.

80;109.0;5.0;6.0;"I live in Florida and was looking for a small AA powered radio to have on hand during hurricanes. I bought a $50 Grundig but wasn't happy with it. After reading many SW/DX review sites I bought this radio.\n\nSo far I've found that all the positive statements about this radio seem to be true. The second night I had it I tuned in Radio Netherlands, Radio Japan, Radio Cairo, Voice of Vietnam, and Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran. I was blown away. I'm new to shortwave so maybe this is no big deal to most, but for $150 I'm getting alot of entertainment from this little radio. I thought it would sit in a box until the next Hurricane Charlie, but I'm using it every day.\n\nSound from the little speaker sounds like, well .... sound from a little speaker. I didn't expect anything different. It's fine for talk radio, NPR, etc. I bought a $15 pair of earbuds for stereo listening and I'm very pleased with the sound. The built in world clock is pretty cool.\n\nAs for lack of an AC adaptor, it doesn't really bother me. As I understand, the Sony adaptor created a lot of interference on the short wave bands, plus it's no longer available in the states. Universal Radio offers a non-interfering adaptor for this radio for a reasonable price.\n\nThere's a small learning curve at first but after reading the manual and flipping through ""Passport to World Band Radio"" I was up and running in an hour or two.";I love this radio!!
47;110.0;4.0;5.0;As a licensed ham operator I have a number of desk top receivers available to me that certainly perform much better than the Sony 7600GR but the initial price was quite a bit more too.\n\nI wanted a really portable radio for SWL and one that I could use for traveling and emergency type use.  This radio performed well above my initial expectations.\n\nThere are many great reviews and I agree with most of them, but here is one thing that you may want to consider if you purchase this radio.  Sony doesn't make the proper battery eliminator for this radio. Without proper filtering RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) becomes a critical problem.\n\nNo problem you might say I will just use a proper wall wart 6vdc@300ma and it will be fine.  Yes you can, your radio will probably work well on the FM portion, but you will have so much noise on the general coverage bands that you will just use batteries and wonder why they put a plug to use a wall wart...... BUT WAIT there is a solution.  Universal Radio sells an adapter just for this radio.  They have added the extra filtering to a regular wall wart and it works great. You can find it at [...]\n and is priced at $[...] and well worth it if you want the AC adaptability.;Great Radio for the price
86;111.0;4.0;6.0;"I have two of these radios,as well as a variety of other models and brands. reception is generally high in quality although I live and work in a very interferance prone environment. These radios have proven reliable under adverse conditions. The light function has not proven even margenally useable on these radios ,so I use a small flashlight to read the display in dark conditions. This is something Sony should fix, as it is very anoying. I would also like slightly larger control switches on the edge to ease ""by feel"" adjustments. I like this radio very much, and use the sideband to hear utilities and ham chatter.";excellent but could be better
49;112.0;4.0;5.0;This superb shortwave radio has one major fault: no 120 volt house current transformer.  A proper transformer for shortwave radios needs noise suppression, so you can't use just any transformer.  In addition. the radio's jack for the 120 volt power supply is not among the standard 4 or 5 plugs on the generic multi- transformers. In fact, it requires a unique plug, and the Sony transformer is quite expensive.  Universal Radio Supply has a proper transformer for 120 volts for this model at $19.95, but they do not ship to foreign addresses nor to P.O. boxes.  If you don't mind using only batteries or are willing to add more to the cost of the radio, this is a very fine receiver.;One major fault to this great radio.
91;113.0;5.0;6.0;I have, and have had, lots of SW radios including a number of Sonys.  This is one of their many gems.  Great perfomance, lots of memories and snazzy look. Good for travel (certainly not as compact as the SW100, of course).  A great radio to consider if you only want one shortwave radio, and don't want to spend very much. Good for listening, and good for DXing while traveling.  Look no further.;Unbeatable Size and Performance for <$150
50;114.0;4.0;5.0;I've had mine now for about 18 months. It performs as a radio quite well so I won't delve into that. Other reviewers have already done a fine job of that.\n\nMine has survived a few considerable drops and still works great. The case shows some damage. So this is a sturdy radio.\n\nMy biggest pet peeve is with the darn Timer Standby feature. Something I will never need. The problem with it is that it is far too easy to turn it on by accident. And the default power-on time is 1:00 a.m. I have been woken up many times at 1:00 a.m. because of this. One can change the power-on time, but every time the batteries needs changing it reverts to 1:00 a.m.;Great Radio!
58;115.0;3.0;5.0;As a Ham radio operator I am very satisfied with the quality of this radio and its capabilities.  Very good reception.  It only received 3 stars because it generally requires two hands to operate, operation is not intuitive, I find myself constantly going back to instruction manual, and it drains batteries quickly.;Very Good Radio - Challenging to Use
62;116.0;5.0;5.0;This apparently is the last of the Japanese-made portable shortwave radios, and the last of the Sony shortwave line for sale in the USA. I own many desktop receivers and portables, and this has become one of  my favorites. It's very sensitive on shortwave and along with the sync feature, it really makes listening to less-powered stations from around the globe a pleasant affair.\n\nUsing the included antenna reel helps, although not really necessary. I use this radio with a set of Sony Studio Monitor headphones and bypass the tinny-sounding speaker. As far as price/performance ratio - this radio is superb. I consider FM as a free bonus on this radio. And it's got better than average reception of FM to boot.\n\nDid I tell you that this radio smacks of quality construction too? I noticed that the speaker grille is made of aluminum. The radio has some heft to it too.\n\nEverybody seems to compare this Sony with the Sangean ATS-909. Buy the Sony instead of the Sangean. While the Sangean has more bells and whistles, and costs an additional hundred dollars - yet the Sony has far better reception.\n\nThese radios WILL become classics. Get yours while you still can!;Excellent little receiver!
64;117.0;5.0;5.0;This radio has super sensitive reception. I hesitated purchasing it, because people said they didn't like pressing buttons, rather than tuning with a knob. Well... it's not bad at all. It has a great scan feature, and if you set the ATT threshold correctly, you'll get mostly real stations and a few birdies. The batteries (not included) last forever (NiMH) and the sound quality is pretty good too. It is very well constructed, and pretty easy to operate. I do wish the scan/delay time was programable. It will find a station, and you reach over to stop the scan, and its already off to find another one. Stick the external antenna in your window at night, and turn this thing on - you'll hear plenty. And YES it does have SSB. Upper and Lower Sideband (selectable);Great Product
65;118.0;5.0;5.0;The 7600GR has been around for many years now. There's not much to not like about it. It performs great. It has synchronous detection circuitry which most other portables don't have. It's not quite as good as the sync detection on the legendary Sony 2010, but still very good. The only thing I don't like about the 7600GR is the fact the AC adapter is not included, and you can't charge the batteries inside the radio. All in all, the 7600GR is still a top world band portable. Many newer models have come and gone over the years, but the 7600GR is still going strong. If the 7600GR costs more than you want to spend, look into the Kaito KA1102. It's also a great performing radio, that costs little over 1/2 the price of the Sony.;Synchronous detection circuitry sets it apart from the rest
76;119.0;4.0;5.0;I've had many short wave radios over the years. I recently bought a Grundig Satellite 800 which got a lot of hype. Unfortunately it got zapped with lightning. But I was not happy with it anyway.\n\nBut I am very happy with this Sony product.\n\nPros:\n\nVery good front end. It picks up everything that's available (using the supplied long wire antenna). The AM reception is excellent. And I don't think I've ever had better FM reception.\n\nFor SSB it has a BFO which I much prefer over IM tuning.\n\nI've fallen asleep with it on a few times and the batteries have not suffered much (the Grundig was a battery eater).\n\nI think the speaker is perfectly designed for listening to short wave broadcasts. Everything is crisp and clear. It is not designed for listening to music. You may want to use headphones for better music quality.\n\nThe Sync Lock works well and can make it easier to hear weak stations.\n\nCons:\n\nThe tiny switches on the sides are not all that easy to use.\n\nIt's hard to fine tune the BFO with such a small dial (but it can be done).\n\nConclusion:\n\nYou will not find more bang for the buck. I doubt you will find anything as good a twice the cost.;A Great All Around SW AM-FM Radio
81;120.0;5.0;5.0;"When I first opened up the box with the little Sony 7600GR, I was a little dismayed at its small size.  Wow has that little rig surprised me!  Once mastering the tuning technique as so instructed in the manual, the radio has surpising performance.  Once proper tuning is learned, the reception is good and even the audio is improved.  I am able to tune in even faint stations with acceptable audio from the little speaker.  Of course the booming powerhouse shortwave stations sound great.  It took me awhile to get used to the digital tuning but I prefer it now to the old dial method; it's faster.  I use a clip on long wire antenna to improve reception.  All in all for such a small portable radio, one couldn't do better!";Great little radio!
82;121.0;5.0;5.0;I was looking for a good shortwave radio but didn't want to spend a fortune.  The Sony ICF-SW7600GR is without a doubt the perfect solution!  Navigation through the settings is easy and intuitive.  Reception is clear and strong, even without the supplied wire antenna.  I have been able to pick up stations from Havana Cuba, Cairo, Egypt, Rome, Italy, Iran and countless others during the evening hours from the Mid-Atlantic area.\n\nThe supplied shortwave station guide is helpful but outdated.  I recommend purchasing the Passport to World band Radio guide that is published annually for up to date programming.;Excellent World Band radio for the price!
84;122.0;5.0;5.0;"Overall, I give it 4.5 stars.  After reading many favorable reviews of this radio, I bought one as an ""upgrade"" from my 1991-vintage Radio Shack DX-440.  The Sony is a high quality receiver with some nice features, but I think it's overpriced.  For $150+ the standard accessories should include an AC adapter, rechargable batteries and an earphone.  Shop around if you plan on buying one and try to get it on sale.\n\nGood things:\n\n- Well made, solidly built.\n- It's compact!  Like the size of a paperback book.\n- Excellent sensitivity and very good selectvity.\n- The synchronous AM feature works as advertised to reduce interference.\n- 100 memory presets.\n- Fully adjustable attenuator control (RF gain).  Very useful when signals are too strong.\n- Audio line-out jack (see below).\n- Single side band (SSB) reception.  Required for listening to HAM operators and certain other signals.\n- Dual clocks.\n- Display is recessed to reduce damage/scratches.\n- Included clip-on reel antenna really helps reception.\n\nNot-so-good things:\n\n- The audio.  It generally sounds muffled on shortwave broadcasts and just ""okay"" for regular AM/FM reception.  Using ear buds helps, but the best option is running the line-out into an external amplifier.\n- Small, recessed switches on sides of radio can be difficult to find by touch and hard to operate.\n\nMinor negatives:\n\n- Battery life is average, plan on using rechargables.\n- Controls and features not 100% intuitive.  Read the user's manual.\n- Small display.\n- Backlight could be brighter.\n\nOne last note: I don't understand why some reviewers claim the sensitivity is poor.  As I write this in Colorado, the receiver is sitting on the floor with the antenna tucked away, and Radio Havana is booming in loud and clear. :)";Very nice radio, though a bit expensive.
85;123.0;4.0;5.0;"I agree with most of the other reviews that this is a nice little radio.  The build quality is excellent and the performance is pretty much as advertised.  I did return mine as I felt the audio quality on the shortwave bands had a ""thin"" quality which made (for me) listening unpleasant. The sync detector does help, but only marginally, and I found the ""hash"" noise while scanning irritating. The Sony is selective and sensitive, but on the shortwave bands my very inexpensive 30 year old tabletop proved more listenable for me.  Curiously, I thought the audio performance on the FM band was nice considering the size of the little Sony.";Nice radio with shortcomings
95;124.0;4.0;5.0;"Overall I highly recommend this radio if you want to tune into exotic and far-away radio stations.  The synchronous detection circuit helps reduce signal ""fade"".  No other current radio offers this feature as this price.  The ICF-SW7600GR is a solidly built radio and offers outstanding sound performance.  The only complaint that I have with this radio (hence 4 out of 5 stars) is that it is slightly big and heavy.  Nonetheless, the performance it gives makes it worth packing in your suitcase.";Excellent radio for the price!
97;125.0;4.0;5.0;There are only two choices for frequency FM and AM.  Shortwave is selected under the AM band button.  There are numerous  pre-set button: perhaps too many and the novice user is at a loss when first using them.\n\nReception signal is OK and Speaker is OK but the technology of both is no better that what was offered ten years ago by grundig for the same money.\n\nIt's a fine shortwave for the money, if you pay no more than $100-$120.;Nice..However
99;126.0;5.0;5.0;This radio has additional controls on both sides of the radio to aid in tuning in frequencies.  This radio is able to pick up stations that some of my other portable radios can not.  It is more than just AM (MW), FM, and SW (my count is 14 bands)-  it can also tune LW.  This radio has a quality feel to it.  There are cheaper radios out there but I chose this one based on having owned a 7600 series radio previously (used it extensively for about 15 years until the on/off switch failed, I regret not getting it repaired).  On the rear of the radio is a world map with time zones.  The radio also included the Sony AN-71 compact Antenna and a short wave radio station book along with the owners manual.

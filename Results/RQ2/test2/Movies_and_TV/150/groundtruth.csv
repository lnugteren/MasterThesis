68;1.0;5.0;569.0;Please try this BEFORE agreeing to any surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) or stress urinary incontinence (SUI). At age 40, after having four children, I was very active walking, running, biking, rollerblading. But all of that exercise apparently didn't do much for my pelvic floor. I had a level 3 bladder prolapse, was talked into surgery using a transvaginal mesh bladder sling (Yep, the kind you see on the lawyer commercials on tv). Long story short, that was 4 years ago. I was one of the 15% of women who have severe complications from mesh surgeries. The mesh eroded through my vagina, urethra, caused severe nerve and muscle damage, and ultimately had to be removed surgically. After 7 surgeries to try to deal with all the problems this mesh caused, I am now disabled, living in chronic severe vaginal/pelvic pain, unable to sit at all, and unable to work anymore. And guess what? I still leak when I cough & sneeze after all of that! So please, please try this before you consider surgery. I'm using this DVD now to try to get some strength back in my pelvic floor, but it is too late for me - the damage is done. I don't want any more women to suffer.;Please try this product before agreeing to surgery - I was disabled by pelvic mesh surgery!!!
149;2.0;5.0;11.0;I cannot recommend this DVD enough!!!!! I'm 34 and have had three babies (all vaginal births) with my youngest being 3.5 years old. About 10 weeks ago I discovered I had a prolapse (felt like a tampon was always falling out of me and so uncomfortable walking around, lower back ache, pressure in rectal area) and after research I immediately purchased this DVD. I was dedicated and disciplined doing the workouts at least 4-5 days a week and being conscious of how I was sitting, lifting and so on. I'm thrilled to report that after about 7 weeks all of my symptoms have gone away and I feel normal again! I still do the exercises 2-3 days a week and kegels every day and I'm planning to slowly add in other workouts to gain further strenth. If any woman out there are suffering with pelvic floor prolapse you must try this DVD!!! It's dated but it works!!!;It Works!!!!
148;3.0;5.0;301.0;"After my 2nd baby I had a prolapsed bladder...was told by the midwife that I'll eventually need surgery & that's all I could do (surgery that doesn't even fix the problem)...\n\nI heard about this from another Mama & so glad I got it...\n\nAfter 2 times I couldn't feel the prolaspe @ all.  At the end of the 6 weeks (which is all it takes) it's completely GONE!\n\nAt first, I thought ""$30 whoa!""  But this is by a PHYSICAL THERAPIST who had prolapse herself, so if I were to go to a physical therapist, it would cost a LOT MORE AND I would have to go to an appt. a few times a week...this is awesome b/c I can stay @ home w/ my baby & newborn & do it!\n\nI CAN'T THANK THE WOMAN WHO CREATED THIS DVD ENOUGH!!!";** IF YOU HAVE PROLAPSE, GET THIS IT WORKS!!!  ***
147;4.0;5.0;288.0;"Having had a background in anatomy and physiology as a outcome-based massage therapist, I am quite familiar with how the body works. I have been athletic all my life until I recently had two pregnancies back to back. Both, natural births at home, took quite a toll on my pelvic floor. My midwife had a few resources which I reviewed but knew they were missing a lot of information and/or had a lot of other information I didn't care for like healing the ""spiritual"" aspect of the pelvic floor. Hab-it Pelvic Floor is like going to a high quality physical therapist in your own living room! The price is minimal for the benefits you receive. I can't sing their praises enough. Very detailed, very clear and concise, exactly what was needed for me to be guided into healing and getting things back where they belong. Already seeing a difference and it's only been a few weeks in. Note: video includes excellent information segment and then exercise segment which is divided into four different workouts. You just have to do one of the workouts each time, three times a week. So one of the four, three times a week, any of the four. The fourth being the most difficult. Once you get used to how they go, there is even a section of time efficient workouts so you can save time. Love this DVD! Recommended it to my midwife and she is thrilled about it too - giving it to her clients in the future. May consider giving this as a gift to new moms!";If you're looking for something to help with pelvic floor issues. LOOK NO FURTHER!
42;5.0;5.0;158.0;This was a lifesaver for me. After the birth of my second child I felt great and was very excited to get back to running after about 4 weeks because I had stayed fit/run throughout pregnancy and was itching to get back into my old routine. I went for a short run and felt something 'shift'. I ended up with a uterine prolapse, 2nd/3rd degree. Upon searching the internet and talking to my OB I was completely devastated. I was a D1 college track and cross country athlete and running is a defining part of my life...I was told from all angles that I was never going to run again and the only resolution was going to be surgery after being done having kids. I went through a couple of months very depressed, mean and just overall miserable. After a fellow mom mentioned this DVD I decided to give it a try. After a month of doing the DVD every other day I added in some weight training and really focused on building my core, hip flexor and and lower back muscles. In late January I started to run again, starting with a qtr of a mile at a time and raised the distance by a qtr of a mile each week. I just ran a half marathon a week ago at 8 months postpartum and am back to running like my old self.  I highly encourage anybody dealing with prolapse or any other pelvic floor issues to try this DVD before agreeing to any surgery...mine is completely gone and for that I am so grateful.;Prolapse healed, Running again!
100;6.0;5.0;186.0;I am writing this review for any postpartum women who are crying as they are scouring the internet for solutions to their prolapse.  My pregnancy and labor did a number on my pelvic floor- very active lifting and exercising all through pregnancy, induced at 42 weeks, in labor for 30 hours, pushed for 3 hours, was being prepped for c-section when finally forceps were used at the very last second and my 9 lb 13 oz baby was born sunny side up with a very large head and his hand pressed to his forehead. I didn't stand a chance at walking away without some trauma.  I cried every night over how things looked and felt and was saving up for surgery.  6 months later my gynecologist shrugged her shoulders and said prolapse like I had to live with it.  I tried a women's health physical therapist which helped a little but not enough.\n\nI got this DVD and wasn't sure if it was really doing anything until after doing it diligently for 4 weeks, life got in the way and I skipped the workouts for a couple weeks and all of a sudden I could feel that things were slipping back.  This truly works for me and has given me hope that things can get back in place, or at least closer to where they should be.  And I am no longer fearful of having a second pregnancy and delivery.\n\nThis is much cheaper than physical therapy, very informative, it works, and has given me hope.  I am so thankful that this product exists.;Has given me hope
117;7.0;5.0;72.0;"I have lived with my mild, yet annoying prolapse for several years,however suddenly it made a dramatic and HUGE descent, causing recurrent bladder infections, difficulty in walking, irritation and then BLOOD!. That sent me to the emergency room at my local clinic (doctor's office closed that day) where the attending physician recommended immediate surgery. He suceeded in pushing it back in and when I got home,I improvised a temporary ""sling"" and would periodically gently push ""it"" back in myself. When I got the DVD, I was absolutely amazed because after the very first work-out, there was definite improvement. Each day gets better and better. My biggest problem has been figuring out how to advance the DVD to the next segment - am sure that is my fault as I am not very skilled at dealing with my  electronic gadgets. I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL TO HAB IT:PELVIC FLOOR  and not only endorse it, but BEG  those who are dealing with prolapse to order it immediately before you consent to not-always-successful surgery.";ASTONISHING, IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENT!
1;8.0;5.0;84.0;If your doctor has recommended pelvic floor physical therapy this a good alternative to scheduling times at a clinic.  Within three weeks of beginning the program, three times per week, I had significant improvement.  That was just using the first 3 workouts on the dvd.  I haven't attempted the fourth workout yet.  Not that it looks too hard, I just want to get a pilates ball if I'm going to do it. These exercises work more than just the pelvic floor.  There are several muscles that work in conjunction as is explained on the dvd.  It also shows patients of all ages and fitness levels performing the exercises so don't be put off if you're out of shape - they aren't that hard to do. I planned to go on to a clinic if this wasn't helping me but that won't be necessary now.  Saved me time and money. Well worth the $29 to see if it will work for you.;Convenient and effective
34;9.0;5.0;42.0;Well worth the money and more. I currently go to physical therapy as referred by my OB due to pelvic organ prolapse (after having my second child). My PT only tells me to do kegels, but I told her about Han-it and she says that I should keep doing the Hab-it videos if I have them. Strengthening the core is known to help strengthen the pelvic floor (many articles and women's magazines recommend similar exercises that Tasha Mulligan includes in her DVD).  I have been doing this DVD for 6 weeks (haven't skipped one day) and I feel a lot better. She says you can do every other day, but I had time due to maternity leave so I wanted to do as much as possible to improve faster. Just don't overdo the kegel portion.\n\nTips:\nGo to her website Hab-it.com.\n1. She has the videos in downloadable format to put in your phone. I didn't see this till later. Alternatively you can download a program like handbrake for your computer to convert DVD to QuickTime video to put on your phone, which I did. This gave me no excuses. I also screenshotted the exercises and saved them on my phone so by the time I did these exercises for weeks I only needed to see the screenshot and not open the video to prompt me to do the exercises.\n2. She has a 7-day advanced workout so if these 4 workouts are getting too easy or you plateaued, buy the advanced workout! It's more variety, longer, and really kicks your butt. I bought this after I was doing all 4 exercises everyday and it was getting boring and long.\n\nA nice side effect of these exercises is I'm more toned and lost some weight too! I still have some prolapse but my PT says it feels a lot less and my kegels are stronger too. This is an amazing program.;Best thing I did for my prolapse. You will not regret it!
119;10.0;5.0;63.0;I have been very pleased with the results I have gotten after only 3 weeks of using the exercises in this DVD.  I have been very faithful in doing them at least 5 days a week but have already found the benefits amazing and I am a 66 year old woman.  Only wish I had had this 20 years earlier.  The workouts are easy to perform and the instructions are easy to understand and follow. Tasha does an excellant job of walking you through each exercise.  I would highly recommend this DVD and feel it is well worth the price.;Great exercise DVD
124;11.0;5.0;64.0;"After the somewhat traumatic (for me) birth of my son, I had a severe prolapsed uterus.  After two years it had not improved, but had progressed to a stage three.  My OB/GYN recommended surgery.  I almost scheduled but I decided to give this a try first.  My goodness.  In four weeks I've gone back to nearly where I was before pregnancy.  I was always been ""shallow"" and I still have a couple of inches before everything is perfect, but my cervix is now at least four inches higher.  They should hand these out at the hospital.  I even had a midwife.  How could we not know about this before? I'm serious when I say this video saved me 20 grand and major surgery.";Saved me from surgery!
141;12.0;5.0;69.0;I got this about a month ago and had done the video several times.  It made me more aware of my muscles which I have been tightening regularly, doing some of the exercises as the day went on.  I have a prolapsed uterus and cystocele since pregnancy 10 years ago, and yesterday the uterus just moved back into place!  Very cool, my body feels like it did years ago, everything in the right place.  Thanks to the people who made this video, will keep using it indefinitely!!!!!!;Muscle awareness works!!
144;13.0;5.0;59.0;I purchased this DVD after being prescribed physical therapy by my Urogynecologist.  I have been plagued with muscle spasms after a hysterectomy, bladder sling and correction of a rectocele and cystocele over a year ago.  Even though I am only 42, I have been unable to sit for any length of time and unable to resume jogging and exercise.\n\nI'm so grateful to have found this DVD on Amazon.  After only two sessions of exercises, I am already feeling fitter.\n\nI am also very impressed that the PT responded to my feedback email and gave me some tips that have helped even more.;Very helpful
135;14.0;5.0;55.0;While my wife still not 100% (she has an extreme case which has many layers to it), I will say that this dvd has been one of the only things that she does that she and I both feel is helping her.  She loves that there is a lot of guidance and explanation to begin but then, once you understand and don't want or need to take all that time to complete your workout, there is the time efficiency section.  She also likes seeing the graphic visual alongside the model performing the exercises. She likes that it is not a trendy workout so someone could have used these techniques and exercises 100 years ago or 100 years from now.  I am grateful that this dvd is out there for woman who suffer because it is a little talked about issue and it has been extremely hard to find any help for my wife.  I highly recommend it to anyone displaying any pelvic difficulties.;42 + hour labor created quite the beat up pelvis
93;15.0;5.0;46.0;"I had no idea before this video that inner thigh muscles had both a front and a back portion, and that they had anything to do with the pelvic basket.  ""Do your kegels and you'll be fine!"" I was always told.  Well, this DVD explains why i have super strong vaginal muscles and yet my bladder is prolapsing.  It isn't just something that happens to your body because you have kids.  Butt muscles, inner thigh, abs, and more.  You have a lot a muscles that hold up your insides.  Who knew?  Well, this person did.\nI also bought vaginal weights, and I have to say I'm getting a lot more out of this dvd than the vaginal weights.";My inner thigh muscles have a use??
146;16.0;5.0;52.0;This is truly a wonderful product.  I had a cystocele (bladder prolapse) after the birth of my second child and was utterly devastated at how restricted I felt because of the bothersome symptoms.  I just want to share that after only 4 weeks of doing these exercises I have had HUGE improvements.\n\nThis DVD is made by and actual physical therapist who specializes in Pelvic Floor rehab and had a grade III cystocele herself after each one of her 3 kids.  It is clear,concise and packed full of helpful info.  The exercises are not too difficult and I actually find them somewhat relaxing. It only takes six weeks (doing one of the workouts 3 times/week) to fully rehab your pelvic floor and then just maintenance Kegels after that.  It is a wonderful product for only $30!!!  I HIGHLY recommend it to ANY new mom with or without prolapse.  It can not only help current prolapse issues but also help prevent them in the future!!;Miricale !!
128;17.0;5.0;46.0;After a rough delivery, at about 3 weeks I diagnosed my own rectocele. I had a natural delivery, and felt betrayed that my body was so traumatized, and found the symptoms very uncomfortable. In a fit of despair, I ordered this dvd, and was elated to find that after 2 weeks of regular use, my body started to feel normal again. Incidentally, I slacked for a week,thinking I was fixed, and my prolapse symptoms started to return. These exercises work, and also provide some gentle toning postpartum. Prolapse is something women should talk about more, and prepare each other for the possibility postpartum. I highly recommend!;A postpartum lifesaver
25;18.0;1.0;26.0;The exercises appear to be great but the DVD is NOT closed captioned! As a hearing impaired consumer, I am extremely disappointed that it isn't captioned. I have my t.v. volume up almost all the way and am still having a hard time understanding the instructions. Please, be decent and caption the thing!;The exercises appear to be great but the DVD is NOT closed captioned
127;19.0;5.0;44.0;The DVD is excellent in quality and content. I am recommending it to all the gals that I am training with for the half-marathon we're running this fall. At sixty, I have enough to worry about without the constant discomfort that goes along with a weak pelvic floor. It had gotten to the point that I was not sure I could continue to train without surgery. After doing the first set of exercises I am thrilled. They are easy to do with gradual steps between each of the levels, clear instructions, and excellent graphics. Thank you so much, Tasha!;Just what I needed!
35;20.0;5.0;27.0;Great dvd for those of us with bladder problems.  I'm 72 and started having problems while sneezing, coughing.\nExercises are very easy to perform and really do help.  My doctor says she wishes more women would turn to the\nkegel exercises before the situation gets any more serious.;Great DVD
33;21.0;5.0;25.0;This is a great video. Using this along with the IntiFit kegel exercise kit has given me total relieve. I'm very grateful that I found this video. I had stage 2 bladder prolapse, doctors told me just have more sex, at 65 I'd rather do laundry, and  besides you'd have to it everyday. They just make you feel that your old and useless. Which I'm not, I'm active, live on a hobby farm and I'm in great shape. Now I can do even more since I don't have to go to the bathroom all the time.;This is a great video.

143;25.0;5.0;39.0;This is an excellent dvd for those who suffer from pelvic floor muscle weakness. I found this video to be very informative,explaining in an easy to understand manner the function of the pelvic floor muscles and the importance in regaining their strength after surgery,childbirth or simply the effects of aging. After a detailed explanation there are 3 separate segments of specific exercise routines to regain tone of the pelvic floor. I was very impressed with this video and wish I had known about it before I spent hundreds of dollars in a local physical therapy office where I felt extremely uncomfortable and embarrassed and therefore,did not obtain the positive results I had hoped for. This dvd has enabled me to practice these specific exercises in the privacy of my home without fear of embarrassment that sufferers of pelvic floor muscle problems sometimes feel. I would recommend this video to all who suffer from pelvic floor muscle weakness.;"Review of:""Hab It:Pelvic Floor"""
16;26.0;5.0;18.0;As I've become peri-menopausal I've experienced stress incontinence. This DVD reduced the symptoms after 4 weeks and has continued to be helpful to the point where I am not experiencing stress incontinence at all. An unexpected bonus-- my posture has improved a great deal as a result of this DVD because it exercises core muscles in addition to the pelvic floor. In general I've found the exercises good, although I am unable to do the squats in the workouts because of an ankle stability problem. (I've substituted wall squats instead.) I will continue with these exercises and am adding core exercises because they are very helpful in daily living.;Extremely helpful
2;27.0;1.0;10.0;I discovered I had a vaginal prolapse after having issues removing a tampon (I typically wear pads, but was in a bind back in May and wore a tampon for the first time in my life). The prolapse is most likely from the birth of my daughter two years ago. I began my research on what to do for it, as I don't want to have or eventually have surgery for it (I've heard way too many horror stories). I started doing this DVD back in the very beginning of June...and instead of doing it three times a week, I ramped it up to roughly one workout every day/other day. I cycled through exercises one through four for each day I did it. I went out and bought an exercise ball (well, two - a large and a small) and additional stretch bands. I also did kegals, as suggested, throughout the day everyday (held kegal for 8 seconds with four quick flicks). It is now mid-July and my vaginal prolapse is no better and no worse than when I started the exercises. Literally no improvement whatsoever.\n\nDoes this have the possibility to help other women? It apparently has and probably will for some, but it did absolutely nothing for me.;Did nothing for my vaginal prolapse after 6 weeks of regular use.
12;28.0;5.0;16.0;I was having pelvic floor issues after a homebirth of my fifth child. I felt like my organs were falling out after I was standing only for 10 minutes or so. This completely fixed that feeing in less than a week! I did the entire program. I thought it was well explained, a good amount of time, and nicely progressive. I'm soooooo glad I purchased this.;Total miracle!!!!!
137;29.0;5.0;34.0;I was experiencing urinary frequency/urgency after the birth of my last baby, and doing Kegels alone didn't take care of the problem. After doing these videos for just a week and a half it is no longer a problem! I can't believe how quickly it was resolved! I'd recommend it to anyone experiencing any type of pelvic or incontinence issues!;Best video to recover following birth of a child!
14;30.0;5.0;16.0;Awesome explanations.  Easy to do.  Time efficient.  I absolutely hate to exercise and I've been able to stick to this so far for a few weeks.  I haven't completed the full 6 weeks yet which is when you are supposed to start seeing results.  I've seen a slight Improvement at the 2-week Mark.;Excellent!
140;31.0;5.0;34.0;"I'm very grateful to Mrs Mullingan's Pelvic floor work-out : it's very easy to do,and after one month you can both feel and see the difference! Pelvic Floor is really ""healthier"" and it's very pleasant too, you will see your stomach is really more tough and flat. I have four children... and now I feel much more healthier and self confident. And when you begin to see results, it gives you motivation and energy, even after a rough day, to do one of the three different work-out.";It's an excellent program!
139;32.0;5.0;33.0;I learned about this CD on the forum at prolapsehealth.com and started using it at 4 weeks postpartum and its just fantastic.  It is appropriate for both beginners and seasoned exercisers.  The length of each workout is perfect for busy moms.  The instructions are clear, easy to understand and follow, and anatomically correct.  The accompanying blog is very good.  The workouts are flexible and can be done alone or combined.  Most importantly, it works.  At 8 weeks postpartum I no longer have any irritating symptoms and as a delightful bonus my whole lower body muscle tone is improved.  My only regret is that I didn't know about this 4 babies ago.  Highly, highly recommend!;Fantastic!
82;33.0;5.0;24.0;I recently had surgery for pelvic organ prolapse. I wanted to be sure that I am doing whatever I can to prevent further problems. I purchased the DVD during the period of physical therapy for PF. The PT asked if she could review it before I started so that she could be sure that things were done properly and would not hurt my repairs.\n\nWhen she returned the DVD the following week, she gave it a thumbs up! She said that it contains so many of the PF exercises that she does with her patients and recommended that I use it 3 times a week.;Hab It Pelvic Floor
94;34.0;5.0;25.0;I cannot recommend this product enough.  There are so many things to say...it improves your sex life tremendously!  It helps incontinence!  And if you have organ prolapse and are scared that surgery is your only choice...THIS DVD IS FOR YOU!  I suffered for many months with a prolapse and was terrified of having surgery (have you seen all the commercials for attorneys suing for that very surgery?!).  With regular use I've been able to stave off the prolapse!  And my sex life has been so greatly improved because I'm not longer uncomfortable or in pain!  Don't hesitate!  HabIt is worth every penny!!;Hab It Is A MIRACLE!
87;35.0;5.0;24.0;"Recently I noticed that my mild pelvic prolapse had been getting worse and had progressed to moderate to severe. I am middle aged, and menopausal. After researching I found that pelvic floor exercises can sometimes help keep the problem from getting any worse. I was skeptical to say the least but wanted to keep surgery as a last resort option only. I purchased the dvd and went to work. I was surprised how I felt some soreness in some of the muscles the next day, the exercises seemed so simple! It was obvious that I had not been using those muscles much in my everyday life. I have been doing the exercises for about 6 weeks now and I am currently on the 3rd set of workouts. All I can say is wow! I can really feel a difference. It has not cured the prolapse but the symptoms are really and truly, honest to God better! I can actually feel the difference and am much more comfortable. For you ladies who suffer from prolapse you will understand what I mean when I say things are ""riding higher""  in there. I am so glad I did not let my skepticism keep me from trying this. It has made such a big difference in how I feel. A huge Thank-you to Tasha for putting this work out together.";WOW!! This really does work!
126;36.0;5.0;27.0;Not only does this workout strengthen the pelvic floor, but it is also strengthening my thighs & legs.  As a result, I'm becoming a better runner!  Very nice surprise!;Excellent Product!
18;37.0;5.0;14.0;Very organized exercise program to address pelvic floor issues.  The use for women is emphasized. I wonder if men can benefit from the exercises. Exercises are fairly brief (under a half hour) and totally doable by and almost 70-year-old. Thank you for a holistic approach.;Organized DVD with efficient exercises
54;38.0;5.0;19.0;I had a hysterectomy a year ago at age 60. I have always been an active woman, taking vitamins, exercising and eating a healthy diet. Three months ago I noticed that I was not paying as much attention to my pelvic floor or core muscles,as I should have been all these years. I ordered this DVD and started using it right away. The results have been wonderful,my pelvic floor has gotten stronger,I noticed a difference in the first week. I plan to continue these exercises. Tasha Mulligan's instruction is top notch,she explains all the reasons why we need a strong pelvic floor and core,she also gives good instruction on how we can tell if we are in the proper posture stance. I wish I had started these exercises at a younger age,but better late than never. I would highly suggest that all women get this DVD,it's that good. Thank you,Tasha!;Great DVD and Instruction
92;39.0;5.0;22.0;The instructions and descriptions of the exercises are very clear and informative. I just could not stand the thought of having surgery to correct my prolapse and decided to give some serious exercise a try first. I have used the program for about 2 months and have noticed a great improvement. I could tell I was making progress with in the first 2-3 weeks. When I saw my OBGYN a few weeks ago, my prolapse was down graded to a stage one! I will continue to use these exercises and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this video to anyone looking to rehab their pelvic floor. It was definitely worth it for myself.;Very Helpful Exercises
23;40.0;5.0;14.0;I've been doing the workout for about a month and I'm already noticing results and I'm only on workout one. The education given on anatomy and how you need more than just kegels to strengthen your pelvic floor and get improved continence is really helpful. I'm very happy with the program.;I'm very happy with the program
110;41.0;4.0;23.0;I don't have any medical issues.  I just was looking for something to help strengthen me.  I think this is a very informative video to help strengthen the PC muscles.  I hadn't realized there was more to remaining in tact then just kegels.  The instructions are clear with good pictures and explanations.  I do additional squats with the video after learning how important squats are for the PC muscles as well.;Very Informative!
32;42.0;5.0;15.0;I am fairly young (22) and after having my son 3.5 years ago I had a slight uterine prolapse. It was uncomfortable and I was worried it would get worse. Doctor told me my only real option was having the mesh put in or a hysterectomy when I was older, as I was still too young. I want more kids in the future, so that really was not an option.\n\nThis DVD starts slow, and you think these workouts really do nothing, but after just a week of use I could tell the difference! I have never been more grateful for a purchase than this one. I went from not being able to workout without discomfort, to not even remembering I had the issue. My gynecologist was actually surprised to realize things were holding up better without surgery.;Wonderful!
134;43.0;5.0;25.0;I had many problems after the birth of my fourth child. I have noticed a difference after my second workout. I was told by a doctor that nothing could be done for my prolapse. I can actually FEEL the difference in my pelvic area.  I can't wait till the sixth week results. Thank you for this dvd;thank God for it!!!
79;44.0;1.0;20.0;It seemed great until I found out that the physical DVD media was of very poor quality and there are parts that freeze and skip no matter what I try.\n\nThis only happens with some portions of the DVD, and I only discovered the problem after the refund policy expired, so Amazon refuses to refund my money. A bad experience all around.;DVD freezes and skips - cleaning does not help
8;45.0;5.0;10.0;This is an amazing PT workout.  After being diagnosed with slight prolapse after the birth of my first child I started to do these workouts.  She explains each exercise thoroughly.  After a few weeks, my prolapse felt almost gone.  Then I got the stomach flu so didn't do these exercises for a week and the prolapse got noticeably worse again.  Anyways I  am now back to doing these exercises again.  I am sold on these and would recommend them to anyone postpartum, even somebody who doesn't have a diagnosed prolapse.  An extra bonus is that my husband absolutely loves how I hold myself using the posture this video not only explains but also strengthens the right muscles to enable you to hold during the day.  I have also tried a couple workout videos from Whole Woman and met with a WW representative, but in my opinion the workouts on this PT video are far superior.  This really is a good buy to have several PT workouts for less than the price of one PT appointment.;It works
10;46.0;1.0;11.0;The material was probably good, but the DVD could not be maneuvered from segment to segment.  In other words, you could watch it all the way through, but if you wanted to focus on one of the segments and skip another, that could not be done.  I had others try the DVD on other DVD players with he same outcome.  Unfortunately, because of that, I returned the DVD.;The material was probably good, but the DVD could not be maneuvered from ...
133;47.0;4.0;24.0;I bought this after I had my baby and had a cystocele (bladder prolapse). Tara thoroughly describes the exercises and why they help, and she's very easy to understand and listen to. However, it's not just kegels. It's also abdominal, back, and upper leg workouts, which all help more than just kegels alone. However, the workouts take a long time (the shortest one is 8 minutes, and that's AFTER you've mastered the moves first) and I just do not have time to do these with a toddler running around and my busy schedule. If I had plenty of free time or was a stay-at-home-mom, I would do these every day because I know they'd help and it has great reviews. But unfortunately I don't have the time.;Good exercises, but take too long
22;48.0;4.0;13.0;The animations were helpful for understanding the musculature involved in the exercises, which made a big difference in how I was doing them and my success in strengthening my pelvic floor. I used this video regularly for a couple months. During the same time, I used pelvic weights. I think both were helpful and I met my goals. This video would benefit from an update. Also, the short version cut some transition time between exercises and was hard to keep up with, but the long version wasn't needed after the first couple times through.;Very Helpful
77;49.0;2.0;19.0;I bought this dvd for postpartum incontinence and diligently did the workouts for about 4 weeks. I saw some improvement but it was very small and I still had moderate incontinence issues. I bought the XFT iEase also available on amazon\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Calliger-Pelvic-Exerciser-On-Screen-Biofeedback/dp/B00H5GDO4Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1407339566&sr=8-1&keywords=iease\n\nThis thing is amazing. I can actually see on the screen how strong my muscles are contracting when I do a kegel exercise. I had no idea how weak my muscles really were but this machine measures your strength and ranks you according to levels. I started at level 2 (weak muscles) and am rapidly improving because I can SEE how much I need to push myself. With this Hab It dvd, I thought I was working hard but never really knew where I was at so I didn't push myself even though I thought I was. If you truly want to regain muscle control, go with the XFT iEase. It's a but more pricey but is SO worth it. I'd pay a lot more now that I know it works.;BUY THE CALLIGER iTONE INSTEAD
13;50.0;5.0;11.0;"I was devastated when I experienced a bladder prolapse after the birth of my baby.  My midwife recommended a costly physical therapist to correct the issues, and when one appointment cost me $200 I decided to give this a try first.  I stuck with exercise #1 and despite my best efforts only squeezed in the workouts about every three days.  However, it still worked!  After a few weeks my symptoms had almost entirely disappeared, and I was back to my favorite exercise of walking hills, now with a much more informed and capable ""basket.""  I enjoy the exercises so much (they simply feel good) I'm continuing on now, in my second month of doing them, and look forward to further results.  Highly recommended!";Tried This Instead of Costly PT, and It Worked!
20;51.0;5.0;12.0;I found myself dealing with a prolapse 6 weeks postpartum with my fifth child. As a very active person I did not feel like this should be a controlling factor in my life and immediately began looking for some solutions. I quickly ruled out surgery as anything but a last resort since it seemed to have lots of risk and little return. So I decided to check into rehabilitation. That is when I cam across this DVD and promptly ordered it figuring it was way cheaper than doing PT in an office somewhere. I have now been doing these workouts for over 2 months and they have made a HUGE difference! I am now hopeful that by the time my baby is weaned I will be back to full speed. I have noticed Tasha has an advanced workout now out and I am hoping to get it at some point and maybe I will be able to return to running again!;As a very active person I did not feel like this should be a controlling factor in my life ...
59;52.0;5.0;16.0;This dvd is great for strengthening the core muscles! I've been using it for a few weeks and can notice a difference already. I would highly recommend this to any lady of any age. It is geared to getting those muscles in shape regardless of age or circumstance.;It works!!!

I thought I will have to live with it forever and was very depressed. Then I did a lot of reading, researching about remedies and also went to a few physical therapist sessions.  I would say that this is the most helpful exercise among all. From other reviewers' comments, it seems that I will have to constantly follow this exercise; otherwise the prolapse comes back. I very much prefer doing this to  the feeling of prolapse.";Very good product
26;54.0;5.0;12.0;This is a fantastic program! I injured my low back several years ago ruptured two discs and ended up with nerve roots contacted on both sides of my spine. As a result I have dealt with terrible sciatica down both legs and pelvic floor dysfunction as a result of the lack of movement in my pelvic region. Having worked with professional physical therapists with little success, I had almost given up hope of ever regaining function in my low back and pelvic floor. From the first time I pressed play and went through the workout I could feel a huge difference. The functional approach to the entire pelvic floor and supporting muscles was exactly what I needed. For the first time in years I have hope that my condition has and will continue to improve and consequently grant me better functionality and pain relief. If you aren't sure about this purchase I can tell you there's nothing to lose and everything to gain by trying this program.

3;56.0;5.0;7.0;Excellent teaching and exercises for pelvic organ prolaspe. DVD is excellent! I  am glad I found out about this DVD.  I am going to a physical therapist  and this was just a reinforcement and some extra info the PT did not cover. Need to learn as much as possible to recover and live a life again.  I am 60 and have a mild prolaspe of bladder, rectum , uterus,  and cervix. I could not function without a tremendous amount of pelvic pressure before starting physical therapy, now after 2 1/2 months, I was able to hike up to 12 miles again, bike, and garden. Doctor had suggested surgery or pessary, but so far I have just been faithful in the exercises given and have seen great results!;This DVD is worth the money to help in recovery!
27;57.0;5.0;12.0;I went to physical therapy for pelvic floor help after having my first baby.  This video is pretty much exactly what they taught me!  I highly recommend this postpartum.

83;58.0;5.0;17.0;I didn't really realize/acknowledge I was having pelvic floor issues until after I started these workouts.  Before completing the workouts the 2nd time I was no longer experiencing any urinary incontinence, which, while minor enough to ignore in the first place, is sure nice to be without!\n\nAn even larger benefit was when I realized the hip strengthening exercises virtually cured a decade old IT-band injury.  I'm running a reasonable number of miles again for the first time since college!\n\nThe workouts are competed quickly and Tasha's cuing is timely and keeps the exercises efficient and effective.  I recommend this to all my mommy friends!;helps with pelvic floor and hips
48;59.0;5.0;14.0;i have to admit i have not watched/used it yet.  but i have been in physical therapy for 3 months now (for my pelvic floor) and it is working great.  i bought this and let my pt watch it - she said it is a great video to use.  but a warning from me - going to a pt gives you specific feedback on what you need to fix vs. a video that can't tell you what your real issues are.  there were many things that i thought were fine with my body that weren't and vice versa.  THIS CAN'T REPLACE A REAL PT. i am going to use this after i am discharged to keep up my exercises.  My advice it to see a PT first, then use this to reinforce your treatment.;SEE a PT first!
4;60.0;5.0;7.0;Life changing! I was so depressed after I got a pelvic prolapse after working out too hard after having my 3rd baby! Now I feel back to normal and my abs are amazing! I did this video only 5x a week for 6 weeks and didn't lift anything heavier than my baby! Can't wait to try the advanced video!;Life changing!

85;62.0;5.0;16.0;My husband ordered this for me and I began Kegal's while waiting on shipment. One and a half weeks ago I began Hab it, doing the exercises daily. I am virtually pain free at this time. The pain before was ruining my life. The burning was horrific. I am amazed and Incredibly grateful. I can cough, sneeze, and laugh and stay dry already, even after years of being this way! It was the pain however that drove me to action. The reviews speak for themselves.

This makes me wonder if the good reviews were really real. If they were really written by those who actually bought the video.  I mean, everyone is entitle to their opinions, why getting bad about it.  For example, the lady who couldn't play it on her DVD player except on her computer.  Instead of getting mad, give her suggestions on what to do!;Product good or not good?
58;64.0;5.0;14.0;"AMAZING.  If you suffer from pelvic floor dysfunction, this woman and her videos should be your new best friends.  You have to remain diligent, but it is worth it.  I cried through my first two workouts due to embarrassment and sadness at needing these workouts.  However, I quickly got over it and I quickly saw results in pain reduction and lessening of urgency.  These workouts are easy to follow, demonstrated perfectly, and you are encouraged throughout in a soft-spoken, encouraging voice.  Training your pelvic floor is tricky and awkward, but it is worth remaining true to!!  Interstitial Cystitis or PFD sufferers--this must be a staple in your recovery.  I can't wait to purchase the 6-pack workout video Mulligan recommends!!  The only gripe I have with the video is that I am potentially barren and the narrator mentions a ""bundle of joy"" or ""your little one"" as encouragement or reward for finishing a workout (or even for having PFD, which I'm sure a lot of you moms out there feel that way--but I may never be one).  Some of us have PFD without the joys (or results) of motherhood, and these comments made me feel even more isolated.  Whatever, I got over it, this workout is amazing and I obviously thought those few comments were worth ignoring.  Buy the tape.";Relief. Is. Here

21;66.0;2.0;10.0;This DVD is easy to understand and is highly recommended by reviewers.  However, I have to say after doing 3 of the sessions, I just could not take the boredom of it.  The exercises are fine, it is the instructor.  She says the exact same words every time.  And I was not motivated by the fact that she is dressed in street clothes. The whole thing felt odd and I have ordered another DVD.;Couldn't take the boredom
86;67.0;5.0;15.0;This video series is fantastic for those of us who have to do exercises.  The guidelines are easy to use.  I saw results within a week of doing the 15 minute exercise routine daily.  And then of course, there are added benefits, sexual benefits...but I'll keep it PG clean here.  :)  Definitely worth it.;Fantastic and useful and easy to use
74;68.0;5.0;14.0;This is a miracle cure and has changed my life!!  I had stress incontinence and was feeling miserable about it.  Kegals weren't doing the trick so I bought this DVD.  I haven't had a leak since starting the first routine!  I followed the first workout until I knew the instructions and am now doing the quick version of the first workout.  I love how I can do it when I wake up in the morning and am tired because it isn't strenuous.  Mostly I love how it works!!  I will keep doing this workout at least 3 times a week forever!;Miracle Cure

This is of course my fault, not the program's, which is an excellent program, easy to do and easy to follow. But if you have a busy schedule, you might prefer a kegel excersizer, which does't require a DVD and set amount of time.;Effective, but a large time committment

The workouts are short and once you do them a few times you can retain the exercises and do them throughout your hectic day as time permits.\n\nThe Education about the anatomy is a must for every women. I feel this video would be helpful for any woman, teaching us all from the start how to care for our pelvic floor.\n\nThe price is great, delivery is fast, there is nothing to loose.

38;73.0;5.0;11.0;Fred's wife here...  So 4 weeks after having a beautiful 8.5lb baby boy, it was very apparent that I had a prolapsed bladder :(  I had 2 weeks to go before my first postnatal Dr's appointment but I didn't need him to tell me what was already obvious. So I started to do some research and came across the Hab It DVD. Ladies, it is well worth the $20 or $30. I started  doing the Hab It video at 5 weeks postpartum 5x per week and within 3 weeks I could tell it was already improving.  I couldn't get a pelvic floor physical therapy appointment ( which my OB/GYN prescribed) until 2 months after my 6 week appointment and I'm so happy I had this dvd.  It goes beyond just kegel exercises and will help your core in general  get stronger.  My baby is 5 months old now and my bladder prolapse is still there but soooo much better. I'm pretty confident by the time he's a year old I will rarely think about it. If you any sort of pelvic floor issues don't ignore them! You must work to make them get better. This dvd is absolutely great. I now do it only 2-3 x per week.;Get this DVD!
104;74.0;5.0;15.0;What a wonderful DVD! I was so thankful to the instructor Tasha for her encouragement and expertise. I was recommended to have surgery, but in only 1 month I have seen a tremendous improvement. The $30 has been worth every penny considering I won't be missing work for surgery or dealing with all the issues involved with weak pelvic muscles. She is so thorough in her directions and has a time efficient work out for those of us that are time crunched! I feel so fortunate to have stumbled onto this DVD! I can't recommend it enough! The muscles can be tricky to locate and she even uses graphics to help you isolate muscles that most of us are not familiar with.;Great purchase!

Great, progressive PT exercises.  After 2 months of doing them about 5 times a week it has made a huge difference with my 'undercarriage' problems, which were getting pretty bad and which are now about 90% better.  It also helped the small amount of abdominal separation I had from the pregnancy!\n\nDefinitely watch the intros at least once; they help make the exercises more effective.  I find that a small portion of my bedroom floor (or even the bed) and an inexpensive child's ball are sufficient for most exercises.  It does take about 29 minutes to go through each routine, but it's worth it.";This is a fantastic PT program for lady-parts problems!
138;79.0;5.0;17.0;I went to a physical therapist for prolapse, but did not receive this type of information. It was so helpful to have the educational content on this before starting the workout. The workouts are well paced and explained extremely well, along with how they help. Having the workout in DVD form is extremely beneficial, although it does take more time to set up. I also like the blog on their website for more information. I feel relief that this is a condition that can be changed by sticking with the program!;So Helpfu!
80;80.0;5.0;13.0;I have used this now for a few months and have found it helpful.  I already knew that I was having problems with a nervous bladder, but when I experienced a prolapse, I was frightened.  After doing some research, I found that prior to any surgery or other medical things, a round of physical therapy would be ordered. I decided I'd rather do this in the privacy and comfort of my own home. Tasha Mulligan is a PT and specialized in this area. The anatomy and explanations are well done and well presented for visualization. This was important - and helpful - to me. Also helpful, is the quiet, matter of fact voice, the pace of the workouts, and her counting. I can't count, concentrate and exercise at the same time - I need someone else counting!  It took a full month of using this on the FIRST set of workouts, before I could slightly feel the muscles move.  It was in the second month that I began noticing the improvement of bladder issues, with the other nice side effect of seeing a slightly thinner waist and stomach muscles. The third month, the prolapse was not bothering me.  I have followed up with my OBGYN who let me know I was doing the right thing and encouraged me to keep it up.  I'm still only doing the first and part of the second sets of workouts.  I am well-pleased with the results and grateful that Tasha Mulligan put it out.;Hab It: Pelvic Floor DVD helpful

71;87.0;5.0;11.0;This DVD has been great.  After having three kids, I had to get my body back into running shape.  My issue was not incontinence but pressure/organ prolapse when I would run and do high impact exercises.

Her attitude is very encouraging.\n\nI didn't notice this on any product descriptions before I bought the DVD, but she does recommend using an exercise ball and a smaller ball for some of the exercises.  I have a small ball and have used a chair in place of the exercise ball.  (She says you can substitute a pillow for the small ball, and a chair for the exercise ball.) This has worked quite well, except that there is one exercise in the final workout that I could not on a chair.  You may have better luck, but I'm avoiding that workout, which is still too advanced for me anyway, until I get an exercise ball.;So far so good
61;90.0;5.0;10.0;"I'm not even 30, but have had stress incontinence since a young age.  I had heard you pee your pants when jumping after bearing children, so why was that happening to me at age 16?  I always heard, 'do your kegels' but never felt I understood how.  Like how often and in what position and how many.  I didn't feel I knew if I was doing them correctly or even remembered to do them.  12 years and 2 kids later, I'm having a lot of pelvic pain and can't even use tampons because they just don't fit right anymore.\nI have researched a bit into vaginal weights, but always get overwhelmed and then stop shopping.  One day when talking to a friend, I finally decided I had to buckle down and order something.  I about cried when someone said in a review for weights that they didn't work with a prolapse.  It describes the symptoms I had with tampons and said a doctor may not mention a minor prolapse.  I had thought things just weren't quite right in there.  But what to do now?  I kept seeing this stupid dvd for sale and thought, ""no! I need equipment"".  When I finally read reviews, I felt hopeful and knew I needed to try it.\nI've not been perfect about using it, but have been pretty decent.  And even if I haven't made it through an entire workout, once in bed, I actually remember to do kegels and feel like I can actually do them.  I apparently needed to be walked through it the way this lady does it.  And the visuals really help.  Yes it gets annoying to listen to.  But I just listen to something else and watch for cues.\nI feel that things are changing and I haven't had the pelvic pain!  I'm hopeful that things will continue to improve as I continue with the program.  Yes, it just may be worth your money to buy a stupid dvd.  Think if it as physical therapy, because it is.  For someone with less problems than I have, other options may be best,  but if you have very little pelvic floor strength,  this is a great place to start!";A DVD?  Really?!?  Sounds useless, but it can do wonders!

I'd love to see another dvd with more exercise options.;I'd love to see another dvd with more exercise options
131;98.0;5.0;12.0;I have almost lost hope to ever getting my life back after my third child. I prolapsed and it freaked me out. Praise Yahweh! I was lead to this program and it is affordable and straight to the point. I recommend this to women of all ages. Say yes to this and no to surgery! This works surgery costs a lot with failure at the end.;Just what we need
39;99.0;4.0;8.0;"Simple but great video. Was very helpful to me in dealing with a prolapse issue. I like the feature whereas you can play a version of the exercises with complete instructions or you can choose to play a streamlined version without the longer explanations when you have become familiar with the routines. I do agree that this video should be  promoted by OB-GYNs - being told to ""go home and do Kegels"" just doesn't cut it.";Simple and Effective!
9;100.0;5.0;5.0;I've started the first workout and feel how my pelvic muscles work. I've been diagnosed with a mild bladder prolapse and hope to see results within weeks. So far, I liked the first workout.;I liked the first workout
66;101.0;5.0;9.0;I am amazed by the results! After 6 weeks of using this DVD my incontinence has improved dramatically. For the cost of less than one co-pay for physical therapy I have been able to do a complete physical therapy program in my own home. Kegels didn't work for me but this did. An added bonus is that my lower back is feeling better too! I highly recommend this DVD.;It works!
45;102.0;5.0;8.0;These simple exercises are excellent.  Not only do they help with prolapse, but they give you back your waist, flatten your stomach, and firm your behind, whether you are recovering from pregnancy or out of shape or a senior you will be very pleased with the results.  I would love to have an overall work out program from Tasha!  Never have I seen such results from exercise.;Major gains from these exercises!!
46;103.0;5.0;8.0;I am amazed at the results I saw the first two weeks of just doing workout 1.  This is so life changing!  Working on my fourth week, starting workout 2 today.  I wish I had found this DVD years ago!  I have a bad back, so will alternate workout 1 and 2 this week.  Working on this 6 days a week has made such an impact on my quality of life, I am so thankful!;effective results
70;104.0;5.0;9.0;This video is life changing for me.  I do not have prolapse but bought to improve pelvic floor health.  I feel it has changed my life in the first viewing.  The information on posture alone was worth more than the cost of the video.  It sounds cliche but I only wish I had found/bought it sooner.;I honestly cannot say enough good things
111;105.0;5.0;10.0;I've actually only used this program a dozen or so times, and it was enough.  It is amazing in fact, and completely reversed the symptoms I was having in a very short amount of time.  If I even remotely feel them returning, I'll be right back doing this wonderful program.  It's very informative as well and really helps you understand what's going on with your body and how to correct it!  Fantastic!!;Fantastic!
60;106.0;5.0;8.0;Holy cow! I just found out I've been sitting wrong all my life. I feel a difference after the first workout which was hardly a workout. Amazing. I will follow up with more after a few weeks.;Hopeful for back pain relief
63;107.0;5.0;8.0;This works amazingly for postpartum help down yonder.  Easy exercise but specifically targeted and effective.  If you are suffering from incontinence, do yourself a favor and order this (and stick to it!);Super helpful
67;108.0;5.0;8.0;Targets muscles you didn't know were there, and wouldn't know how to work if you did. I don't use it regularly enough, but I can tell from the little time that I have that it is doing the job even without doing it as much as I should.;Targets muscles you didn't know were there, and wouldn't ...
99;109.0;5.0;9.0;If you're having pelvic floor issues, either post-partum or post-menopausal (or really, for any reason), this really does help.  Nothing is magic, and it will take time, but you will notice improvement.  It has been a God-send for me.\n\nAlso, even if you don't have a pelvic floor problem, this is a great graduated core workout that anyone, man or woman, would benefit from.  I would imagine that the posture and core strengthening would help a myriad of issues.\n\nThis is money well spent.;really does help
30;110.0;5.0;6.0;Love this, wish I had found it earlier.  Only been working out with it daily for a few days but already see results.  Easy to follow workout, very instructional and the instructor is great.  Thank you.;Wish I had ordered this sooner.
49;111.0;5.0;7.0;I intended to purchase a pelvic floor  DVD by Julie Wiebe after attending a course of hers for physical therapy professionals when I discovered this DVD by Tasha Mulligan. The reviews on this DVD inspired me to purchase it. It is great! I work as a physical therapist assistant and I have incorporated several of the exercises from this DVD into my treatment plans. I do the exercises myself and I recommend this DVD to anyone and everyone regardless of whether you are experiencing pelvic floor dysfunction or not. All women can benefit from the information and exercises presented in this DVD. Thanks for sharing your knowledge, Tasha Mulligan.;It is great! I work as a physical therapist assistant and ...
31;112.0;5.0;6.0;I purchased after doing a lot of research after finding out I had prolapsed bladder.\n\nThis has been in my opinion one of the most clear and sensible exercise videos for prolapse.\n\nAfter being diagnosed I was depressed and didn't know what to do but then I got over it and did my homework and came across this.\n\nMy biggest problem is my own. Taking time.  When I am regular in my exercise I feel better and stronger and notice I pay attention to my posture and doing kegels on my own.\n\nTasha is very clear and caring. I highly recommend this dvd!;Excellent source and help
108;113.0;5.0;9.0;Don't expect it to work overnight but stick with it and you will see improvement.  If you want to try a noninvasive solution, I think this is it.;Excellent approach
52;114.0;5.0;7.0;It's all on video.  No misunderstanding what is being told in a book.  Just watch and do the exercises right along with host.  Worth every penny.;Worth every penny
36;115.0;5.0;6.0;My mom bought this about 6 weeks ago and has shown significant improvement in bladder control.  She convince me to buy it and now I'm getting results myself.;Great!
120;116.0;5.0;9.0;GREAT video. Has great exercises that really helped me post-partum. If you really devote yourself to this and perform it daily, it can absolutely do wonders for you. The video is very easy to understand and follow. She does a great job in explaining each exercise so theres no question in how to perform them.  And it doesn't take much time at all to perform.  Great to do while the baby is napping!  Or can do with your baby lying right there with you.  Love it! Absolutely recommend!!!;Used post-partum- absolutely recommend!
91;117.0;5.0;8.0;I haven't been using the program very long, but even after the first viewing and test run I could feel a difference in my muscles.  I actually woke up sore the next day even after just doing a simple run-through once or twice without being meticulous about body form or posture.  I'm sure that after using this program as recommended, for the time recommended, it would get results.  I mostly purchased the program to flatten my stomach.  I read that a flatter stomach cannot really be obtained without toning the core abdominal area.  The program description led me to believe that the exercises on this DVD would obtain that goal.;Effective.
101;118.0;4.0;8.0;Just about 4 weeks into the exercises and feeling good about them. PT today said I am doing them correctly, nice to have a PT say that. Tasha does a great job of explaining and talking us through the exercises.;So far so good
40;119.0;5.0;6.0;excellent step by step workout, difference felt after 2 weeks and getting better by the day;Five Stars
43;120.0;5.0;6.0;I have been doing the exercises and am seeing results. Thanks.;Very pleased with the improvement.
44;121.0;4.0;6.0;I am very happy to have found instruction that is both very informative, helpful and concise. I hope these exercises will help me regain my what is lost at the moment. I wish I had come across this much earlier.....like before surgery which did not help at all.;I am very happy to have found instruction that is both very informative
112;122.0;5.0;8.0;Works great. Just like going to get physical therapy for a fraction of the cost. Highly recommended. etc etc etc;Just like going to PT
28;123.0;5.0;5.0;Have only used it for about 2 weeks now.  I was a physical therapist prior to going to medical school and I think the exercises are on point. Looking forward to progressing through the exercses and hopefully gaining some better pelvic floor control!;Looking forward to progressing through the exercses and hopefully gaining some better pelvic floor control
29;124.0;5.0;5.0;"Excellent instruction and explanation. I did have a little difficulty with the DVD sticking but cleaned it twice and so far so good. Most Physical Therapist I have worked with start on the ""core"", which is good but I have found that for me this is the place to start. It seems to be at the very root of the problem. I am very appreciative of Tasha's excellent demonstrations and counting out loud reminders as to when  to squeeze so you don't have to try and watch the exercise while you are doing it once you are familiar with the process.  It is also broken up into workouts which is good so you learn one work out and when you are ready move on.";Excellent DVD
84;125.0;5.0;7.0;After 4 weeks of doing the exercises every other day, I am already noticing huge core tone differences.  I am no longer afraid to sneeze.;Buy it!
53;126.0;5.0;6.0;I love this video and exercise program. The instructor is easy to understand and follow. It doesn't take long and it has helped!;Great program!
56;127.0;3.0;6.0;I have received my third DVD from Amazon.  I explained to reps from Amazon that the first 2 DVD's they replaced were defective.  The defect is in the same place on each DVD.  Even the quality of the 3rd DVD (the one I kept) is not good but I kept it because I want to get on with my exercises!  The problem is the first part of the DVD (specifically, Workout 1)  skips or delays then slowly moves to the next part.--NOT HELPFULL when trying to exercise !  The content of the DVD is great.  Just need better quality of physical material of DVD.;faulty material used for DVD
95;128.0;4.0;7.0;I have been doing the excerises for about 3 wks. Easy to understand. The workout instructor is a licensed physical therapist. Which is why I chose the video. My insurance company didn't cover any pelvic floor therapy so this was my next best option. She gives clear instructions and encouraging words to help motivate. Once you have mastered the workouts, there is a time saver option. I would recommend this dvd.;Clear Instructions
98;129.0;5.0;7.0;The explanations of the exercises are good.  I have noticed improvement after 6 weeks of doing the routines regularly.  They are about 17-25 minutes long.  Once you have the hang of it you can do a shortened one that doesn't take you thru the instructions again.;Worth it!!
103;130.0;5.0;7.0;I was traveling 25 miles each way to meet with a physical therapist and while she was wonderful, this is oh so convenient.  Tasha Mulligan explains the anatomy and physiology of a woman's body and really takes the time to explain each exercise.  It is wonderful to have a fast tract too once one is sure of the proper technique of each exercise.  For me, it is nice to see that my physical therapist and Tasha Mulligan's teaching align.  So nice to be able to do in the privacy of my own home.;Hab It: Pelvic Floor review
105;131.0;5.0;7.0;I was diagnosed with a prolapsed bladder before I ordered this DVD. It's a lifesaver. There are three exercises, each lasting about 20 minutes, and then the advanced exercises that last only 8 minutes. I try to do one of the three, plus the advanced, every day, totaling only half an hour. I believe it will prevent me from having to have the surgery. Get the DVD.  It's a lifesaver.;Lifesaver
73;132.0;5.0;6.0;This is like having your physical therapy session in the privacy of your home.  Excellent instruction.  Beneficial to almost every woman.;Pelvic Floor Rehab
113;133.0;3.0;7.0;So far...3 weeks into this and not impressed but still hopeful.  The therapist is a bit annoying.because she keeps repeating the same commands for each exercise. You're sure to mute the volume once you know the routine.;A little disappointing
116;134.0;5.0;7.0;This DVD is a GREAT resource! It offers women the opportunity to really DO something for their pelvic floor! As both a midwife and a woman with a pelvic floor injury, I highly recommend this DVD.;Great resource
142;135.0;5.0;8.0;I love this DVD so far.\nThere are 4 workouts.  I have been doing workout 1 and 2.  3 and 4 are more difficult.  I'm working my way up.  I'm not sure how long to stick with one workout before moving up.  AFter you learn a workout you can switch to the time efficient workout.\nThese exercises seem to help.  I just started a couple of weeks ago so I don't know what the long term outcome will be.;so much better than just kegels
121;136.0;5.0;7.0;This is a fantastic DVD!\nEvery new mother needs a copy of this!\nDon't wait until you develop incontinence.\nTasha's sessions are exactly what you'd get if you made the effort to go to a physical therapist.  This way you get the lessons in the privacy of you own home.;Pelvic Floor exercises
81;137.0;5.0;6.0;Better than any mechanical device your ob-gyn might prescribe.  It gets to the cause of the problem and corrects it.  You do need to do the exercises regularly, but better than yucky devices or surgery.;order this
89;138.0;5.0;6.0;"I haven't done this video as consistently as I should or would like, but I notice when I do it, I definitely feel a lot stronger ""down there"". There is a huge difference when I don't do it. Definitely recommend!";Definitely recommend!
50;139.0;2.0;5.0;Video and sound quality are terrible;Two Stars
51;140.0;2.0;5.0;The DVD does not work on my DVD player or laptop without skipping or getting a jumbled picture. My DVD player and laptop play all other DVD's just fine. This DVD seems like it is low quality. I like what I see in Tasha's video, but I don't have the patience for the DVD issues. Deciding how best to handle this, return the DVD or get a replacement. I am doubtful a replacement will resolve the issue.;DVD doesn't work....
132;141.0;5.0;7.0;"My DVD came just yesterday, but already I am very excited about this DVD.  It is very well done, and the instructor is very clear and pleasant.  I look forward to being successful in ""fixing"" my prolapse, and I also plan to pass on the information to my daughters for their future needs.  Thank you for such a well-done product!";Wonderful!
62;142.0;5.0;5.0;This video saved me!!! After having a 9lb baby 4th degree lacerations I was having a hard road to recovery!! I recommend this video to anyone especially postpartum moms;This video is amazing!!!
64;143.0;5.0;5.0;This is the best collection of pelvic floor exercises that I have ever seen. It takes just a few minutes a day and goes far beyond the simple kegel exercises. I would highly recommend it.;Good for any age
69;144.0;5.0;5.0;Easy to follow program, only 15 minutes, well explained strengthening exercises led by a physical therapist.;15 min, easy to follow strengthening exercises
96;145.0;5.0;5.0;These simple exercises really work, started to notice improvements by second week. Impressed with the easy style of Tasha, wish I lived closer to her practice.\nThank you;It Works!
102;146.0;5.0;5.0;This is an excellent easy to follow dvd, I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to strengthen their pelvic floor. This really should be seen by any woman who has just come out of hospital from giving birth.;HIghly recommended
107;147.0;5.0;5.0;Just started the exercises this week and am very hopeful. The information just on body posture alone is very helpful-makes you so much more aware of how you stand and sit.  The exercises seem geared toward strengthening your core group of muscles....not just kegals. I really like it so far and it is even kind of relaxing.;great program
109;148.0;5.0;5.0;I like this but didn't buy for myself.  it has several 20 minute long exercises that are very simple and easy to do.  these are the right duration compared to actual physical therapy sessions we've gone to.  so, for the motivated, determined person this can be a tremendous help and a tremendous savings of money or insurance.  and, since these can be done at home, the convenience is pretty great too.;Great Video Exerciser Prompter
0;149.0;5.0;6.0;This is a great product! I appreciate how well each exercise is described and shown visually so it's easy to follow along without feeling like you need a translator to understand them.  I also like the fact that I can DO the exercises as shown (and I am no gymnast...just an everyday mom).  I highly recommend this product!\n\nS. Bharteey;Easy to do and it really works!
129;150.0;5.0;5.0;This DVD is set up in real world format.  The workouts are labeled and timed.  So you can choose the workout you have time for.  Plus has  progressive steps to help you learn the routines!;So user friendly and do-able!

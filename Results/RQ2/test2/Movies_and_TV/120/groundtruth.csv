5;1.0;1.0;205.0;"2015 BLU-RAY REVIEW: Triumph of the Will is a public domain film. It belongs to everyone. But Synapse and Film Preserve Ltd has attempted to assert copyright over it by inserting logo bugs in the corner of the frame every ten minutes, and burning in ""explanatory subtitles"" over the top throughout the film. This movie is very important to the history of film, not because it is a ""Nazi film"", but rather because Riefenstahl was a brilliant cinematographer. Each and every cut in the film is masterfully composed and beautifully lit. However with the constant barrage of type and logos over the top, it's impossible to follow the visual flow of the film.\n\nThe film transfer and sound quality is excellent, but this blu-ray version has been rendered unwatchable by constant graphic intrusions. When I first tried to screen it, I couldn't believe that anyone would intentionally deface it like this. Surely the overwritten text was intended to be able to be turned off and this is a simple mastering error. But Robert Harris, the gentleman who restored the film has stated online that the principle reason for the barrage of subtitles was to ""prevent piracy"".\n\nLogo bugs and burned in, non-removable graphic markings are what I expect in dollar store DVDs, not full priced blu-rays billed as ""ultimate editions"". Marking films that belong to the public like a dog marks a tree only cheats the customer who buys the product. It doesn't prevent piracy. Recently, large studios have resorted to reworking and re-editing films and removing the original from circulation in an attempt to extend their control over copyright. It is very discouraging to see Film Preservationists following their lead.\n\nImagine if the Louvre put their logo in the corner of the Mona Lisa and wrote some explanatory text over the top of the painting. If art belongs to the world, it belongs to the world. We shouldn't deface it to try to claim it as our own.\n\nI can't express how disappointed I am. I'm returning this disk to Amazon for a refund. I suggest that if you are interested in Triumph of the Will, buy the most recent DVD release instead. It is identical to this release, albeit in standard definition, and has no burned in subtitles or logo bugs in the corner.";This film has been defaced to assert copyright
101;2.0;5.0;416.0;"TRIUMPH OF THE WILL has long been viewed through a dual perspective:  It is both reviled by many for its glorification of Hitler, and at the same time praised for the masterful work of its director, the legendary Leni Riefenstahl (who at the time of this writing is still alive...I think she's over 100 by now).  The truth is, it is all of that and more - a highly memorable, fascinating experience on several levels:\n1.  Despite the subject matter, it must be acknowledged that this film does what it was made to do marvelously well:  It is a masterpiece of the art of propaganda...somethng that is practiced every day by all governments, in advertising, and in all political campaigns - but never better than this. The film does an amazing job of tapping deep into the German psyche, with scenes of Nuremburg, youth, etc., and allusions to great Germans of the past, all designed to tug at the ""volkish"" national sentiment, then deftly superimposed with images of Hitler.  Very crafty, but no different than what we see every day in our media-saturated world.\n2.  As a study of the early the Nazi era, it is invaluable.  Regardless of what happened in the years that followed, TRIUMPH needs to be viewed as a statement of its own era, when none of the horrors had yet happened and many around the world still referred to the Nazi regime (which was then consolidating power and trying to reach the hearts and minds of the people) as ""the German renaissance"".  The commentary track adds a fascinating ""what happened to that Nazi?"" perspective.\n3.  This film has become unbelievably influential (possibly because it is still required viewing in film schools); it is perhaps second only to THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN as the most visually quoted film in hstory.  Just a few examples:  The closing scene in STAR WARS, ""Be Prepared"" from THE LION KING, and especially the entrance of Commodus into Rome from GLADIATOR are all lifted directly from visuals in TRIUMPH.  Even more common is the visual ""homage"" that directors sometimes subtly insert, such as the woman being tossed in the air from THE BIG LEBOWSKI (remember the kid at the beginning of TRIUMPH)?  The list goes on and on.\nOne certainly does not need to sympathize with the Nazis to appreciate this film.  In fact, it is precisely because of what became of them that makes this early look so fascinating.  Still, I would not call this ""entertainment""; rather, this is a piece to study and analyze.  Recommended for any student of history, sociology, mass media, or film.";"One of the Most Influential ""Unseen"" Movies Ever Made"
1;3.0;1.0;5.0;I was looking forward to buying this bluray copy of Triumph of the Will.  I saw the film years ago and enjoy how truly well-made the film was and its influence on the masses during that time period.  However, after reading the less than thrilling reviews of this recent bluray edition put out by Synapse, I decided to forgo it at the moment and wait for a another company to put out a clean bluray version.\n\nLike other reviewers, I hate it when companies mislead the consumers and later refuse to be held accountable.  I think being friends with Mr. Harris may have clouded Synapse's better judgement of not advising potential buyers of the annoying logo on the film.  I want to thank the critical reviewers for warning potential buyers, like myself, of the problem.;Triumph Of The Will (2015 Remaster) [Blu-ray]
4;4.0;1.0;78.0;This SHOULD have been a landmark title. A historically important film finally getting an HD release BUT Synapse have made a horrible mess of it by enforcing descriptive text on the screen at all times that veers from useful (occasionally) to identifying Adolf Hitler every time he appears. It's incredibly intrusive and irritating and again, it can't be stopped. There's also a copyright protection watermark that appears every 20 minutes and malfunctioning subtitles on the supplementary film. I'm in the highly unfortunate position of having ordered this item internationally so I can't realistically return my blighted copy and it cost a LOT to import. Synapse, you should be utterly ashamed of yourselves and the various Blu-Ray forum discussions on this issue indicate that you are about to suffer a significant backlash for your stupidity.;A historically important film finally getting an HD release BUT Synapse have made a horrible mess of it by enforcing descriptive
44;5.0;5.0;197.0;"After slogging through a number of these reviews it is clear that most cannot see that we Twenty-First Century Americans were not the intended audience for this movie. The movie was intended to be a unifying morale-builder for the National Socialist Party in Germany, which had been in power only about a year when this movie was made.\n\nFrom its loss of World War I until the NSDAP was elected to power in Germany in 1934, the people had suffered every kind of internecine mob warfare, illegal abuse and theft of whole portions of Germany at the hands of the French, and an economic catastrophe that made our American Depression look like a picnic by comparison.\n\nThis movie sought to persuade Germans (GERMANS!) that this dreadful misery was finally over and that the criminal Bolshevik traitors responsible for Germany's defeat in World War I, and all the residual woes, would be defeated once and for all. It must have been a most welcome message because as you watch the film you certainly don't get the impression that anyone had to beg the many thousands of Germans who attended the NSDAP rallies to stand up and cheer their hearts out.\n\nIf you speak and understand German, you'll have a much greater likelihood of being able to understand the impact of these rallies, and this film that celebrates them. For many who are not conversant in the German language or who know little about the actual history of the time besides what they were exposed to in American World War II films, the film is actually pretty boring after a while.\n\nYou sit there and watch one group of soldiers, police, or workers after another, marching and marching and marching. This is interspersed with speeches by Hitler and the other Party officals. From time to time you'll see interesting-looking people doing everyday things, some in costume, but mostly they're just talking, walking, eating, brushing their teeth, and so on. Be advised -- for those of you who expect the whole thing to be a stirring, gigantic SS parade with weapons bristling, be prepared to be disappointed. The last group of soldiers on parade are indeed the SS Leibstandarte Adolph Hitler, and they're marching to what was reputedly Hitler's favorite piece -- ""Der Badenweiler"". Remember to notice that they aren't even carrying rifles or bayonets....\n\nLastly, in my opinon, the commentary by ""historian"" Dr Anthony Santoro is mostly just another sarcastic, demeaning rant against the people in the film, so typical of those who pronounce judgement on the vanquished after every war. The marching soldiers and other Germans who reverberated such thrills of hope for their poor, beleagured country are all long dead, but Santoro must make fun of them for the amusement (?) of the American audience.

103;6.0;5.0;202.0;"I had seen TotW in the theatre (Anthology Film Archives, NYC), on video and I could feel the power, in spite of the jumpy images, splotches of darkness, scratchy prints. The DVD transfer is magisterial. Clean, sharp, the underlying visual rhythm clearly discernible, the structure of the work exerting its magic without restraint. And, as good a sound as one can ever expect. The transition between pompous nocturnal nazi party celebrations to a misty dawn progressively clearing to reveal air views of Nuremberg's ancient rooftops, with the lens coming to rest fully sharp on row upon row of simmetrical white tents, where party members are waking up, all set to the quiet prelude to the third act of Wagner's Meistersinger (a piece in itself celebratory of German art and set in medieval Nuremberg), is pure cinema magic. And it establishes visual continuity (ergo historical?) from the traditional Germany of Hans Sachs to its 20th century flowering under Adolf Hitler...... not a small feat to accomplish within less than a handful of cinematic minutes.\nLike magic, there is technique behind it. This is not a news-style documentary but a film constructed flawlessly in the editing room. Leni had full control of the editing and supposedly did most of it herself. The result is mesmerizing. One can understand how an unthinking populace could fall for it, and how keen an intellect and great an artist Riefenstahl is (I gather she's still active at 90+).  This is not just a nicely crafted collection of pretty pictures of an old city and massive nazi spectacle. Everything is calculated to evoke an emotional response helping consolidate the identification of Germany as Hitler and Hitler as Germany. Yet, it is also a beautiful film.  It is frightening for its lack of human ambiguity, for the willful surrender of a people to a master. There is a lot of ""joy"" portrayed in the film (perhaps of the ""strength through joy"" kind) but after seeing it this time, I realized there is not a single funny moment in it.\nPlacing myself in 1935 Germany, and erasing from my mind everything that subsequently happened, I was comfortably glad to realize that, temperamentally, I would have had a hard time with the nazis, indeed would probably have reacted to all things around me by becoming an anarchist or some such thing. But ... who knows? Films like this are made to seduce.\nThe DVD comes with a short documentary of German military maneuvres also from 1935.  It still amazes me that the French and the English, seeing these two films, not to mention taking into account other German actions in the Ruhr, etc., did not commence rearmament sooner or would not have been so duped at Munich.\nIf you feel it is immoral to watch this movie .... get over it. Anyone with a serious interest in film needs to see this. Anyone interested in seeing how visual imagery can be structured to propagate a faith needs to see this. For that matter, all our contemporary putative manipulators: marketeers, political consultants, advertising executives, TV and  movie producers ought to see this. Citizens who want to remain informed and self-determinating ought to see this. Most immediately, anyone who wants to put together a beautiful, masterly structured film from tons of negative reels needs to see this.... and I don't think anyone born after the war has seen it better than in this DVD.";Splendid transfer of a beautifully malevolent film
3;7.0;2.0;40.0;Pre-ordered TOTW based on online remarks by the famous film restorationist who supervised the Synapse restoration, assuming his participation assured a quality product. Due to the burned-in subtitle-like identifiers, I now regret not waiting for reviews. I value good releases of public domain (PD)  films and understand the risks caused by the inability to copyright a video transfer (the law needs to be fixed). I pay back companies that invest in quality PD by buying from them (e.g., this pre-order). It's crucial to see the film as intended, though, without any irritating BS pasted on the image. I wouldn't have bought TOTW in this release for the ~$25 paid. Considering a first-ever return.;Disappointing: Good Restoration Goofed Up by Forced Text
114;8.0;5.0;95.0;"It's easy to see how this now famous (or infamous) 1934 film by Leni Riefenstal could have helped reinforce Hitler's already dizzying domination of the German psyche. For our own time, it helps reveal the human  complexity of the Nazi phenomenon - so much more than just a march of  crazed fanatics, as it's often stereotyped today.  Triumph of the Will is  particularly relevant to current politics - the Austrian controversy, as  well as the continued importance of various dictators who still garner so  much of the media spotlight.\nSadly, the near-sightedness of the Nazi  mentality and its contradictory nature were already glaringly apparent at  the time the movie was shot.  Hitler's frenzied admonitions to value  ""peace"" but at the same time to cultivate ""courage"",  bristle with contradiction and hypocrisy. Brief allusions to racial purity  and clear-cut moral rectitude are darkly ominous, as are the reiterated  pledges of allegiance to Hitler , the man.  It's instructive to compare  Nazi rhetoric with much of today's political hype.  Though, as many others  have pointed out, nobody else has done it with quite the same elan.  Sad to  think that had they watched their own film with a more discerning eye, they  might have seen what we see.\nFrom an artistic standpoint, I can  appreciate why it's cited as one of the most accomplished of all  propagandist vehicles.  Nazi shortcomings notwithstanding, the film is  stunning.  Riefenstahl's contribution is self-evident - even if she didn't  direct the action herself, she captured and organized it admirably.  But  for all that, it is still the action which is most spellbinding.  The  gripping facial expressions,  the charismatic speeches, the thundering  shouts of allegiance, the enormous scale and choreography - all of this  actually took place!  Combine that with historical perspective - knowing  what all of it would lead to - and the movie acquires a distincively  haunting quality.\nI not only recommend this film to others, I strongly  advise it.  It captures the very essence of social fanaticism.  Many will  instinctively feel its primitive appeal, and then, after putting it into  perspective, recognize its inherent madness.  Watching this movie,  appreciating the feelings it evokes and reflecting on what it all means,  will make the viewer a better person.";A most valuable historical record
34;9.0;5.0;62.0;"I fully understand both the reviews of disappointment and approval of this DVD, ""The Triumph of the Will."" As a WWII fanatic, and one who owns virtually every important, and less important, documentary, I give this film a five-star review for many reasons. Before I share those reasons, once again, I sympathize with those with less favorable responses. The one criticism that I relate to is the marching sequences. The film begins with what appears to be endless marching in 1934 Nuremberg.\n\nWhat is particularly monotonous is the lack of variety; with so many thousands of soldiers marching with spades (post WWI armistice limited Germany to a 100-thousand army, so they didn't want to appear aggressive at that stage), I was expecting to see tiger tanks with their 88 mm. guns, field artillery, transports, and quite literally ""the whole nine yards"", but this is not the case. You will see the SA, the SS, soldiers and nazis of every shape and uniform, but no hardware other than shovels and swords, banners, swastikas, and decorum. So the disappointment for me, and from what I gain from other reviews, is that Leni Rienfestahl (hereafter LR) gives us plenty of marching soldiers ad tedium. The viewer is treated to about 25 minutes of introductory marching before the first speech.\n\nHowever, the strengths of the film far outweigh the flaws. Keep in mind, 1930's movie making was far different than it is today. Back then, if a director wanted to ""truck"" in or out with the camera, he/she had to literally use a truck to do that, giving a zooming effect (that's where the word ""truck"" came from as per movie directing). In addition, LR had to use existing light sources, large or small, and no added SFX, B-roll editing, and lap dissolves were done by hand. The film reminded me so much of Disney's ""Fantasia"" with the use of lighting effects, and vignettes consisting of brief fade-in and fade-outs to build viewer expectation and tension.\n\nNow, my list of favorable feature findings:\n\n1. The extended raw footage and splendid directing allows the viewer to appreciate the ambience of the moment. You feel that you are actually there experiencing the moment. My mother attended a number of Hitler Youth rallies, and told me that a combination of music, color, chanting, etc., left the participant feeling almost paralyzed. The SA had their members littered everywhere throughout the audience who would continually incite the audience to react with heated emotion and praise.\n\n2. The speeches by Hitler and others are unedited. When you view other documentaries, such as ""The World at War,"" you will be treated to only a few moments of speech sound bites. In this DVD, you will see Hitler uncut and hear his words, which are as strange as watching the man himself. He reminds me of a sales speaker I once heard, blasting the audience with the qualities of his product, but not explaining why the audience should buy it. The tripe and shallowness of Hitler's words can only really be appreciated as one can both observe, and listen to his presentation uninterrupted. Here again, the vast majority of documentaries out there give only snippets of Hitler's speeches. Suggestion: if you get tired of the marching and want to view the speeches, simply jot down the times from your DVD player.\n\n3. As a propaganda film produced to be exported, we understand what the nazis held to be near and dear: Hitler was in full gear with his war machine and wanted to show German might through intimidation. The well-orchestrated rally demonstrated unity, determination, organization, and most importantly a national ""vision"" of a German ideal codified in one individual, Adolph Hitler. As Hess declared to the people, ""Hitler is Germany; Germany is Hitler."" The sheer numbers of the multitudes is awesome; I can only try to imagine what it must have been like to have been a Frenchman, or Hungarian, or a Russian, viewing this film for the first time.\n\n4. As an extended film, the viewer can see how the people dressed and carried out their daily lives at the time. How sad that Nuremberg was such a magnificent city prior to the Allied bombing, and the introductory aerial scenes of the city are breathtaking.\n\n5. This is a digitally remastered DVD from 35mm film. The resolution is excellent to the degree that you can see the follicles in a close-up of Hitler's face. Unlike many similar documentaries of questionable quality, this DVD allow the viewer to appreciate facial expressions, uniform insignia, and other detail.\n\nIf you view this film in the historical context in which it was produced, LR was indeed brilliant and ""done Hitler proud."" If you want Hitler in the context of modern filmmaking, you will probably feel disappointed. An excellent alternative would be the recent feature film about the last ten days of Hitler's life titled, ""Downfall"", produced in German with English sub-titles. Even still, try to view ""Triumph of the Will"" in the context of what the Nazis wanted the world to see: behind the pagentry -- power!\n\nThen, be prepared to enter real history: a Nazi night rally, Hitler youth (notice the commitment and determination on their faces!), the farmer's march, the magnificent Congress Hall of the NSDAP, Reich labor review, Reichswehr review, SA and SS review, the Liebstandarte bodyguards, Lutze, Hess, Goebbels, Hitler, and yes, lots of marching. So, fasten your boots, enjoy, and if the marching is a bit much, keep your remote handy.";Enter Real History
46;10.0;5.0;48.0;"The aim  of the rallies and parades described here was to create dramatic impressions that overcame rationality and reached the emotions of participants. The adrenlin that must have been generated among the thousands at these rallies  and other Nazi events, probably could have filled an ocean. Wilhelm Reich's _Mass Pyschology of Fascism__ gives a very good analysis of this aspect of the Nazi party and its regime.\n\nThe film captures the Sixth Congress of the Nazi party in 1934, the first after Hitler had come to office.  What also see is how the Nazis studied what the theater, the cinema, the church, and the pyschologists had learned about the use of pagentry, of light and darkness, of symbol and ceremony to craft their spectacles.\n\nI remember the first time I saw it, I watched it in solemn, silent awe, as impressed by its images as I was disgusted and terrified by what it documented.\n\nLeni Riefenstahl was a genius.  The film techniques used, the editing, the absence of any narration, and the way you are struck by the film despite the utterly disgusting spectacle that this film was, are great example of the what both creativity and technical achievement can produce.\nIt is a massive example of the central concept of dramatic art: SHOW DON'T TELL.\n\nThe film was used not only as a propoganda piece around the world where it won many prizes, but as indoctrination in Germany itself. Every school child in Germany was forced to see this film with its marching storm troopers, its shreaking speaches by Hitler, Goebels, and other Nazi leaders, and its display of pagentry.\n\n  All of this was not by accident.  The congress came after a major crisis in the Nazi movement. The Nazis had always had a radical rhetoric, claiming to defend working people (The party's actual name was the German National Socialist Workers party) against the huge landowners, the bankers, the corporate plutocrats who had in fact bankrolled and managed Hitler's rise to power.  A radical wing of the party was concentrated in the SA, the storm troopers--the Nazi's gangs of organized thugs and street brawlers--, their leader, Ernst Roehm. After Hitler came to power in 1933 Roehm demanded a ""second revolution"" by the Nazis against the plutocrats.  Roehm demand a merger of the Army which was the lynch pin of the old Prussian Aristoracy and Germany's new capitalist magnates-- and the storm troopers be combined under the Roehm's leadership. Germany's ruling class threatened to replace Hitler, or, at least not allow him to succeed the ailing President Von Hindenberg, if Roehm and the other adherents of the ""second revolution"" were not crushed.\n\n  In June 1934 Hitler had hundreds of Storm Troopers including Roehm  murdered.  Roehm was replaced by Viktor Lutze, an insignificant police official and the SA was allowed to whither away.  Meanwhile. the SS, Protective Squadron, which had hitherto been Hitler's personal body guard was extended to become a large organization, fielding its own military divisions in the the Second World War.\n\n  The Sixth Nazi Congress shown in the _Triumph of the Will_  took place in September 1934, only a few months after the SA purge. Throughout the film you are continually seeing Viktor Lutze, you are continually seeing affirmations of loyalty by the Storm Troops, including a huge cermony in which tens of thousands of Storm Troppers swear allegiance to Hitler (Previously, these thugs swore to obey their unit commanders only). In the speech that concludes the Congress and the film, Hitler 's final point is that the two institutions that are the foundation of the new order in Germany are the Army and its aristocartic leadership and the Nazi party.\n\nThe rally ratified loyalty to Hitler, loyalty to the course of serve the capitalists, the landowners, and the army after the Roehm purge.\n\nThe splender of the triumph of the will, the marching thousands, the banners, the spotlights, the festivities of women, children, townspeople, and the brown shirted hordes, all was staging to ratify that the same old plutocrats and big landowners that Hitler had claimed to fight for the interest of Germany's people were still in the saddle.";An ocean of adrenalin

Nowhere in Amazon's product description did it mention that it comes with mandatory English voice commentary that can't be turned off.

I would not have procured a production of such historical interest if I'd known that it was only possible to watch it with its original soundtrack largely suppressed.

If you want to understand the evil that was Adolf Hitler and Naziism, you gotta go to the original source material and this is the Real Deal. This is how Hitler and his people wanted the world to see them and, given the perspective of history, it's far more revealing than they could have known at the time.\nNo wonder than Frank Capra borrowed heavily from Triumph of the Will when he wanted to show the sinister aspect of the Nazis in his ""Why We Fight"" series of films for the U.S. armed forces.\nIf you're serious about history or film (or the history of film), this DVD belongs in your collection.";Quality is a bit disappointing...
37;14.0;1.0;29.0;"There is a dilemma when a repellent ideology underlies a great work of art. It's a profound topic, and there's much to be thought and said about it. But I don't understand why anyone bothers to raise the issue in relation to a gobbler like ""Triumph of the Will"".\n\n""The Triumph of the Will"" is one of the most boring films ever made, endless, monotonous and utterly flat. This is only partly because its content is so tedious. There are speeches from Nazi bigwigs, and some shots of massed callisthenics, but mainly this film celebrates marching. Lots of marching. Then some more marching, followed by some marching, then a bit of a march, followed by more marching.\n\nBut the content is not the only problem; the real problem is that Leni Riefenstahl is not a great, or even good, film-maker. An even moderately competent director could probably make some sort of silk purse out of this material. But Riefenstahl made the aesthetic choices that make this such a boring film. She's not thoughtful enough, or sufficiently interested in people, to focus on people or stories, so one potential source of interest is absent. But nor is she artist enough to make something aesthetically interesting, some kind of abstract image, out of her masses of marching morons. Riefenstahl's Nazism seems to have reflected terrible artistic as well as political and moral judgement. She must genuinely have believed that endless footage of marching is inspiring, uplifting and interesting. Which, unfortunately for anyone watching this film, it aint.\n\nWhen you inquire about why Riefenstahl is supposed to be a genius, it seems to come down to her supposed innovations in editing and camera work. Now, editing and cinematography are important skills, but the scale of excellence in those fields simply does not go up as far as ""genius"". The best film editor and cinematographer who ever lived would be two very skilled craftspeople, but they wouldn't be ""geniuses"".\n\nBut even within this limited and technical field she was not an innovator. Busby Berkeley, to give only one example, was doing massed people sequences filmed with innovative camera angles, zooms, pirouettes and whatnot, plus hyper-active editing - Riefenstahl's supposed trademarks - long before Riefenstahl. And Berkeley was not only first, he was better. At least his films - though still tedious, to my eyes - aren't nearly as bum-numbing as this interminable turkey.\n\nRiefenstahl was an amoral opportunist who participated in the use, and the killing, of slave labour. ""Triumph of the Will"" is Nazi propaganda, a film made in the willing service of evil. But that doesn't make it morally complex, nor aesthetically interesting. It bores, it sets records for being boring, and that makes it an aesthetic failure on its own terms. ""Triumph of the Will"" is, obviously, a film that celebrates evil, but it is also a turkey of a movie, a tedious, boring, bum-numbing gobbler. This is not the stuff of interesting paradoxes.\n\nThere are two reasons why some people pretend this film is not the crashing bore it really is. One is that, obviously, the world still contains the occasional Nazi moron. The other is the Emperor's New Clothes Syndrome. Around sixty years ago people in film schools decided to claim this film was a masterpiece, apparently because they thought praising a Nazi artwork showed them as interesting people with profound things to say and the ability to look past surface meaning to the pure aesthetic heart of the matter. And so on. Since at time, there has been heavy cultural and rhetorical investment in the idea that this is an important film. And it has been easiest to go along with that.\n\nBut it's neither a good film nor an important film. If you're after the supposed Nazi glamour, I probably don't want to know you, but you'll still be disappointed if you look for it here. And if you want to talk sententious stuff about the nature of evil, there isn't much meat for you in this film either. It's a film about marching, by an over-rated talent, who turned in a deeply dull film. This is malign art, and - for reasons that partly overlap with that fact, but are partly independent of it - it's bad, boring, art. As a film, it's a dog. That's the truth of it.\n\nFascinating fascism? More like the banality of evil.";Riefenstahl's tedious turkey, over-rated for suspect reasons

90;16.0;5.0;29.0;"Adolf Hitler is making a comeback.  When CBS announced the mini-series (originally adapted from Ian Kershaw's ""Hubris"") that takes a look at Hitler before he entered politics created a furor over the idea of giving this man's life any more attention than it already receives or deserves.  The very notion of a network profiting from anything relating to Hitler or his Nazi-based philosophy is a flash-point of controversy.\n\nOn a personal note, in the 70's I researched and developed a detailed story called ""Young Hitler's Secret Life.""  It was optioned by Bob Banner & Associates and taken to NBC where it was tested by several focus groups.  The concept of a multi-part TV movie that asked ""What made the man the monster?"" tested higher than anything that had previously been broadcast.  Nervous potential sponsors did their own testing and concluded that no matter how the material was presented, up to 20 per-cent of the audience would sympathize with the central character.  The network and sponsors' fear was that any attempt to dramatize Adolf Hitler implied understanding him, and for some in the potential audience, that apparently meant excusing or erasing the evil. Or worse, embracing Hitler and his ideas.\n\nMy approach to the material focused on the unusual pseudo spiritual, occult themes he studied in his youth and how this peculiar German mysticism influenced his politics and eventually tapped into the collective central nervous system of his followers who, in the end, literally worshipped him as a messiah.  NBC eventually dropped the project.  It will be interesting to see how CBS handles this material and the public response.  Networks, like Hitler, are always looking for the target audience's widest base desire, emotion, or pathology on which to hang their hidden agenda -- advertising.\n\nHitler was a nobody.  A failed artist and a dreamer.  From out of nowhere he rose like the  Germanic god of war Wotan and turned a defeated, demoralized third-world country into a blazing world power.  To hide from the reality of the human -- and other forces -- that engulfed the world 60 years ago makes us even more vulnerable to the contemporary spiritual and political winds that are blowing on the hot kindling of chaos that threaten to ignite us.\n\nLast month (of this writing) German director Leni Reifenstahl celebrated her 100th birthday.  Although she continues to deny any special relationship with Hitler, the genius of this filmmaker helped propel Hitler into the iconic force of dark power that he so carefully crafted and craved.  Except for the Pope's official visits to foreign countries, no propaganda event comes close to the extraordinary, overwhelming visceral potency of Reifenstahl's  TRIUMPH OF THE WILL.\n\nHitler hired Reifenstahl to make a filmed record of the Reich's 1934 rally in Nuremburg.  Hitler was a film buff (he loved Disney cartoons and was often heard whistling ""Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf"").  He was an ardent fan of Wagner's epic opera's and at one time even made notes for an original opera and its staging.  He innately understood the necessary theatrics of staging public political rallies.  The symbols, the banners, the waiting, the music, the marching, the uniforms, the torches and the message.  It all had to come together with an explosive orgasm of shared emotion.\n\nTriumph of the Will is an important film.  Certainly more significant and meaningful than Citizen Kane.  Masterfully designed, shot and edited, TOTW is a witness to the power of beholding that generates change.  To see this film -- no, it won't make you a nazi -- in its entirety is to understand how Hitler cast his spell. Forget the crowds overcome by weeping, hyperventilating hysteria at the feet of Elvis, or the reception of the Beatles at their first U.S. concerts.  What can compare to Hitler parting a sea made up of hundreds of thousands of standing-at-attention and transfixed believers as he marches to the podium.  Or to see the massive, flaming swastikas made up of hundreds of hand-held torches slowly turning in the darkness like the grinding gears of the gates of hell.  Images staged and yet real.\n\nThis Special Edition is a new windowboxed digital transfer that exposes all of the film frame. Light black bars appear on all four sides of the image.\n\nThe interesting audio commentary is by historian Dr. Anthony R. Santoro.  Also included is Leni Riefenstahl's 1935 short film, ""Day of Freedom"" (""Tag der Freiheit""). The newly translated -- and removable -- English subtitles are disturbing and compelling.";BETTER THAN CITIZEN KANE

104;18.0;5.0;27.0;"""Triumph of the Will"" is Leni Riefenstahl's infamous propaganda masterpiece that has been both applauded and condemned -- misunderstood and manipulated. Despite the attempts by politically correct film critics to simply dismiss Riefenstahls work as ""fascistic crap"" - Triumph Of The Will remains a beautiful, poignant dedication to what could be best described as the ""last gasp"" of classical Europe. The photography is simply stunning and the fluid-like movement of the various sequences provides a sense of continuity rarely paralleled in modern film.\nOne of the reasons Riefenstahl's work has simply not ""faded away"" like the dozens of other German and Italian propaganda films of the era, is because Riefenstahl had an acute, sensitive understanding of her subject matter. She tackled her work as an artist, not a politician. Without the trappings of an agenda, Riefenstahl allowed herself to explore on film the hopes and aspirations of her country - who after losing almost 2 generations of men during the First World War and suffering a decade of humiliation and economic deprivation, saw itself as a phoenix rising from the ashes to reclaim its past - a past that had produced Goethe and Nietzsche, Mozart and Wagner.\nAlthough not a member of the Nazi Party, Riefenstahl was one of many European artists of the era who embraced the National Socialist ideal of ""cultural regeneration"" - or, a rejection of modernism in favor of a return to the values and ideals of classical Europe. Riefenstahl realizes these ideals in her film by subtly juxtaposing National Socialist Germany with the pageantry and heroism of ancient Greece and Rome (with flavors of Germanic mythology).\nBy and large it would seem that most members of the public and self-proclaimed ""film buffs"" have never actually seen this film or at best only viewed portions of it.  Why is Triumph of the Will important? Not because it is a ""bizarre"" cinematic look at totalitarianism, but because it is the only occasion in the history of film that Western civilization was captured AS it was actually changing - as desperate and as painful as that process was. That said, Riefenstahl proves herself a masterful director with a flair for cultivating and building upon abstract and larger-than-life themes. She is at once experimental and bold, technique-driven and sensible. Like her contemporary, the classical sculptor Arno Brecker, Riefenstahl allows herself to celebrate the future with a colorful eye on the past.\nWatch this film and you are watching history.";Stunning
94;19.0;5.0;25.0;"It is so easy in hindsight to vilify Leni Riefenstahl for making one of the most powerful and influential films of all time. After all, there is little doubt she was a genius in her field and the fact that she lent her talents to the Nazi Party to make this great propoganda film frightens us to no end. How could such an artistic genius serve pure evil, we ask. Well, what of the world that applauded ""Triumph of the Will"" in 1934? What of the French who gave this movie their highest honors and awards in 1935? And what of all the articles and reviews in England and in this country which tripped over themselves in praise and admiration for this film in 1934 and 1935? If Leni Riefenstahl is guilty of serving evil, so, too, is the rest of the world which paid this film incredible homage when it first appeared.\n\n  This is a breath-taking film! The direction, techniques and editing are truly remarkable. That Riefenstahl was way ahead of her time is not in question. The question is whether or not the times have yet to catch up to her genius as a film-maker.\n  Moral certainty was a rare commodity when it came to National Socialism in the early and mid l930's. Admiration for Hitler was globally more common than we'd care to admit these days. Diplomats and journalists all over the world were praising Germany's economic recovery under Hitler's leadership. At the time when Leni Riefenstahl accepted the commission to film a Nazi rally in Nurenberg, Hitler had yet to expose the evil he would soon unleash upon the world.\n  I am not an apologist for Riefenstahl. However,she never made another film for the Nazi Party after l934 and for that we should all be thankful. We should be thankful because had this woman chosen to serve the Nazis into the late 1930's and early l940's, those films would have served Hitler as well as any weapon system. If ""Triumph of the Will"" is Riefenstahl being non-political, one shudders to think what she would have created on celluloid were she a true believer.\n  Riefenstahl frightens us with her talent. Her manipulation of the audience makes Hitchcock seem like an amatuer. Her techniques, lighting, editing and camera angles make ""Citizen Kane"" just another run-of-the-mill movie. And her ability to seduce the viewer is unparrelled. See ""Triumph of the Will"" and get a glimpse of a rare talent and a genius at work. And then be grateful that she stopped making movies when she did.";And what of the world which applauded?
87;20.0;5.0;24.0;"Hitler wrote MEIN KAMPF, he gave lectures, he wrote letters, he campaigned on the destruction of 'Capitalistic Jewry', and he had a personal film-maker, Leni Riefenstahl.  She captured the anger and angst of the post World War I Germans and their enthusiasm for a leader who promised to make Deutchland great again.\nTRIUMPH OF THE WILL is a triumph of film-making, and thankfully nothing else.  It's hard to imagine a world that might today be overrun by the Nazi jackboot and not shudder.  The black and white film along with the extraordinary camera work, massive rallies (notice the bizarre cult and occult overtones), and subtitles give us a rare -though very scripted to be sure- look into the Third Reich before it threw the world into disarray.  Interestingly, we get a lot of material meant to reinforce Hitler's idea of 'volk' lifestyle: communal eating and bathing among the German military, 'normal' German women participating in what appear to be calisthenics and other dance-type arts, children being acclimated to the machinery of warfare (this is perhaps the creepiest thing about the entire film aside from Hitler mentioning in a night speech that he was there to do God's work...ugh.)\nAn important historical document, example of propaganda film and a painful reminder that Hitler was at least a man of his word; he spoke about taking over the world and sending superior German culture to the farthest reaches of earth, he spoke of destroying the slav and the Jew.  We just didn't listen.  It's funny, but someone made a comment about the President's speech after 9/11 and tried -miserably- to compare it to this film.  Let's be clear on one thing:  radical Islam is NO different a threat than Hitler's thousand-year-Reich, except that Hitler did not have the variety of weapons and world transport that terrorist organizations have today.  Let this film be a lesson to us all: we need to rise up and fight tyranny in all forms.  Our President was right then and he's still right.  Those of you who think this will all go away are deluding yourselves.  I don't need 'Bush propaganda' to convince me, seeing people jump out of those towers was quite enough thank you.";No one can say we were not warned.

50;22.0;5.0;19.0;"An assault for certain, and all the more nefarious due to its artistic merit. Before going any further, to address this edition specifically, I have to say that it greatly enhances the film. It has an optional professor's narrative which can be enabled to play along as one watches. I know a considerable amount about the era, but found that I learned much from listening in to his lecture.\n\nThere are two important justifications for valuing Triumph of the Will. First, even though it is contrived and propagandistic, we are privy to a primary source document from the period-which, historically speaking, is an end in itself. The Nazis were human beings, all-be-they particularly evil ones; men (for the most part) as opposed to Goblins or Orcs. We see this clearly with Himmler who appears to be the only one in SS uniform that cannot goosestep, and also in the awkward interaction between Herr Reichsfeuhrer and his master upon the podium. They don't know whether to shake hands or continue to jut their arms out erectly. Triumph... reveals, perhaps unintentionally, much that cannot be described by narrative or second hand account.\n\nA second reason to see and preserve this documentary is that it makes us more grateful for the democracies in which we live. Through these planned shots and compulsively rehearsed movements, we can feel what it must have been like to have had the misfortune to live within the pincer prongs of a totalitarian state. When confronted by this picturesque masterpiece, we feel a sympathy for the Germans that was not possible 60 years ago. For them, there was no CNN or BBC or Fox News; there was only Dr. Goebbels, and the projects and information he approved or fabricated. No way of hearing the truth was possible, unless they risked their lives to come across it.\n\nLife under the Nazis was as communitarian as could be, and that, as an American, is what I found most repellent. Being submerged within a uniformed mass of citizens is something our Founders would have never tolerated-and thank God for that! A life of conformity and ritual is not a life at all. Having to line up like the workers and youth here to listen to blowhards bellow was certainly an underrated barbarism of that time. Only the Nazis could have turned Nuremberg Party Day into a week's worth of activities. This is a living dedication to narcissistic leadership and the victory of self-adulation over reason. This society was so militarized that even the men of the National Labor Service wielded their spades as if they were rifles. Hitler appears often before us, and is presented in his best light. Yet, one can sense his detachment, and note his manners which are more studied than real. He peers out from hotels and airplanes with a benevolent expression while never remotely caring about the people he is supposed to guarding. Yes, this movie is very slanted, but all the horror you need to see remains visible.";Time Cannot Erode.

45;24.0;5.0;18.0;"After slogging through a number of these reviews it is clear that most cannot see that we Twenty-First Century Americans were not the intended audience for this movie. The movie was intended to be a unifying morale-builder for the National Socialist Party in Germany, which had been in power only about a year when this movie was made.\n\nFrom its loss of World War I until the NSDAP was elected to power in Germany in 1934, the people had suffered every kind of internecine mob warfare, illegal abuse and theft of whole portions of Germany at the hands of the French, and an economic catastrophe that made our American Depression look like a picnic by comparison.\n\nThis movie sought to persuade Germans (GERMANS!) that this dreadful misery was finally over and that the criminal Bolshevik traitors responsible for Germany's defeat in World War I, and all the residual woes, would be defeated once and for all. It must have been a most welcome message because as you watch the film you certainly don't get the impression that anyone had to beg the many thousands of Germans who attended the NSDAP rallies to stand up and cheer their hearts out.\n\nIf you speak and understand German, you'll have a much greater likelihood of being able to understand the impact of these rallies, and this film that celebrates them. For many who are not conversant in the German language or who know little about the actual history of the time besides what they were exposed to in American World War II films, the film is actually pretty boring after a while.\n\nYou sit there and watch one group of soldiers, police, or workers after another, marching and marching and marching. This is interspersed with speeches by Hitler and the other Party officals. From time to time you'll see interesting-looking people doing everyday things, some in costume, but mostly they're just talking, walking, eating, brushing their teeth, and so on. Be advised -- for those of you who expect the whole thing to be a stirring, gigantic SS parade with weapons bristling, be prepared to be disappointed. The last group of soldiers on parade are indeed the SS Leibstandarte Adolph Hitler, and they're marching to what was reputedly Hitler's favorite piece -- ""Der Badenweiler"". Remember to notice that they aren't even carrying rifles or bayonets....\n\nLastly, in my opinon, the commentary by ""historian"" Dr Anthony Santoro is mostly just another sarcastic, demeaning rant against the people in the film, so typical of those who pronounce judgement on the vanquished after every war.  The marching soliders and other Germans who reverberated such thrills of hope for their poor, beleagured country are all long dead, but Santoro must make fun of them for the amusement (?) of the American audience.

82;25.0;5.0;20.0;To start off, I did not enjoy Triumph of the Will. That said, you'll notice I gave it 5 stars. That is because it deserves nothing less. While not exciting or invigorating, for propaganda, it is perfection.\nWhile boring, it cannot help but leave the viewer in awe while watching Hitler walk calmly through 250,000 assembled soldiers. Even when watching him speak to 100,000 laborers, one cannot help but be ensnared by the sheer greatness of this majestic work of filmmaking.\nTriumph of the Will is not a good movie, yet at the same time it is a great movie, worthy of respect, a film that everyone should see at least once, boring or not, lest we forget the past and are doomed to repeat it. With this film as evidence, there can be no doubt that we were warned that war was coming, and did nothing. For that we suffered the consequences. This film should stand as evidence that we should never again be so blind as to assume that such a display could be considered anything less than a precursor to combat.\nWhile I did not enjoy this film, I still must highly recommend it to anyone with any interest whatsoever in history, politics, or the simple truth. It might be called offensive, and it might be called grand. In truth, it is both and at the same time far, far more. Watch, and be amazed.;Masterpiece

It may have been produced as propaganda but what it is now is nothing short of historical documentation, regardless of how the images were woven together.\nIt has great footage and shows all of the regular Nazi Nuts and ones you have never seen or heard before.

57;33.0;5.0;15.0;"Why?  Because there are several facets to this film, and it is almost impossible to comprehend everything going on all at once.  First, watch it for the original cinematography by Leni Riefenstahl.  The off-center camera angles, the close-ups, the moving camera shots.  It may not seem like anything out of the ordinary now, but compare it to other films from the early 1930s, and you will realize how ground-breaking this film really was.  Nothing like it had been seen before.\n\nSecond, watch it for the propaganda.  This film was sanctioned and bankrolled by the Nazis, in an effort to portray themselves in the best possible light.  The Nazis had recently come to power in Germany amid much turmoil, and they wanted to get some ""positive press"" out to the people, and the result was this film.  It was meant to impress but also to intimidate, and it likely achieved both aims.  To see all of these Nazis chanting slogans and marching in lock-step, you get the impression that ""Germany is on the upswing!  Come join us!""  That was their intention, and I dare say it was effective.\n\nFinally, you might want to watch it again, this time with the audio commentary by historian Dr. Anthony Santoro turned ""on.""  Dr. Santoro filled his narrative with many tidbits about not only the known Nazi leaders like Hitler and Himmler, but also many of the lesser known ones, like Streicher and Bormann.  I found that his knowledge of these figures and their era added depth to my understanding of the film.\n\nOverall, this is a very good production.  Everyone should see this film at least once or twice.  Five stars.";Watch This at Least Twice

96;35.0;5.0;17.0;I was watching the closing scenes to Titan AE when the mailman delivered Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will. I subsequently popped it into the DVD  player and decided to give myself a day to mentally change gears after about five minutes.\nTriumph of the Will covers the 5th to the 10th of September of 1934 in which various aspects of Germany's social rebirth under the Nazi party is celebrated, with stirring speeches by Adolf Hitler and his party associates as to the state of the nation and where it is headed.\nTo convey this artistically, as opposed to a simple news reel type of programme, Leni Riefenstahl employed thirty six cameramen, who shot more than sixty hours worth of film. This raw footage was then edited down to one hundred and seven minutes of running time featuring pans, close-ups, aerial shots, jump cuts, linear and rotating tracking shots, and upward angled shots. To aid continuity, and to embellish the visual rhythm, a heavy musical score was added and underscored by interaction from the crowd.\nAll this ends up as a documentary without a commentator, the speeches and crowd reaction being the only vocal element, the sound carefully edited to the pictures so that the dynamic qualities of the film are reinforced. Some  still advocate the idea that Triumph of the Will was a propaganda / public relations exercise for the Nazi party. But this is an erroneous point of view.\nMy DVD was gotten from Amazon .co.uk. The sound quality was very good to poor. The speeches had the best quality, with heavy applause and chanting coming off the worst due to heavy compression and print through artefacts. The picture quality was decent enough for a sixty eight year old film. My copy claims to be the complete film, and is released by DD video of England, so those who have experienced disappointing DVD releases might find this to be a better choice.;Takes a couple of viewings to get into.
84;36.0;5.0;16.0;"Triumph Des Willens opens with Wagnerian fanfare and a series of introductory captions, identifying it as ""the historical document of the 1934 Congress of the National Socialist German Worker's Party.""  The Congress was held 4-10 September 1934.  Other captions remind the viewer that it was ""20 years after the Outbreak of the World War"", ""16 years after the beginning of Germany's suffering"", and ""19 months after the beginning of the German Rebirth""\nIt's interesting to note the skill with which Leni Riefenstahl constructed the 1934 Party Congress as a nationalistic, moral-booster to inspire the Germans that their time of destiny has come.  However, it's also an exercise on picking up hints of Hitler's plans.  Hitler says that the racially best of Germany are the carriers of the best blood.  At the Night Rally, he declares that ""The State does not order us.  We order the state"" and ""The State did not create us.  We created the State.""  The second is true, but as for the first, hmmm....  Rabid anti-Semite Julius Streicher's assertions that people who don't protect their racial purity go to seed is the most overt.\nHitler's skills as an orator are demonstrated throughout, especially his address to the Hitlerjugende (Hitler Youth) and the closing speech.  In the key line in the first address\nwhere he tells the youth to be peace-loving, but strong and courageous, and to learn self-sacrifice and never to collapse, he's basically telling them, ""I'm sending you out to war to be killed.""  Cunning of the man!  And in the closing speech, he is glowing with excitement and triumph.\nThe labour force's equating spades and tools as their weapons in their quest to rebuild Germany is a repeat of the societal militarization during Bismarck and Kaiser Wilhelm II's time.  A slam at Versailles comes where the youths announce where they came from--Silesia, Bavaria, Dresden, etc.  The last two names mentioned:  the Rhine and the Saar.\nOther references are alluded to in his speech to the SA and SS.  The dark shadow that crossed the SA months ago is a reference to the Night of the Long Knives, as is the presence of Victor Lutze, successor to Ernst Rohm, a prime target in the Long Knives.  Lutze and the SA and SS pledge to be faithful to Hitler also establishes Hitler's sole control of the SS, and under him, Himmler.\nThe lion's share of the film, weighted towards the film's latter moments, is devoted to the Grand Review of armed forces in Adolf Hitler Platze, where units of the SA, air force, and SS march, the latter the crowning finale, all marching in formation.  The leaders of each division, such as Lutze, Goering, and Himmler all salute Hitler, stand by him, and watch the processions.  This show of force is clearly a grand telling off of the Versailles Treaty.\nRiefenstahl's cinematography also plays a massive role in this film.  Indeed, certain scenes are best seen on the big screen, such as Albert Speer's Sea of Flags and Cathedral of Light on Zeppelin Field, panoramic shots, such as Hitler, Himmler, and Lutze marching the long distance to pay tribute to the fallen with columns of SA standing at attention on either side, and the closing moments of the Congress.  Aerial shots include the shadow of Hitler's plane flying over Nuremberg and the view of the Hitler Youth tents and barracks.\nAs for the new subtitles and translations, there are subtle changes compared to the copy I had before.  The most notable one comes in the intro, where instead of ""16 years after the crucifixion of Germany"", the caption now reads ""16 years after the beginning of Germany's suffering"".  The brief captions identifying key Nazi personnel help out tremendously.\nNo, Leni Riefenstahl shouldn't be condemned as a collaborator of the Nazi Party?  This documentary if anything set the standard for long shots, the power effect transcended by mass crowd, and the choking close-ups of a symbol, that of the swastika, and as a piece of art transforming speeches and marches into a political extravaganza, is a masterpiece.";A cinematic triumph by Riefenstahl

The speeches of Goebbels, Hitler  and the others are about freedom, a free-press, work, the truth, a new  mysicism and a new future. Not one sentence about war, hate or racism. If  Hitler had this already in mind, really cynical and untrue. The guests from  other countries are treated with respect  and are mentioned in the  speeches.\nOne of the favorite films of Mick Jagger, for example. 300.000  people in the night with torches shaping a Hakenkreuz must be impressive  for anyone. The film is welldone by a famous moviemaker of those times  (just watch her first big success ""The blue light"" in 1932. But  as far as I know, Leni R. had no political interests and did it just  because she had to do it. But well. After the war she was blamed for it.\nLike ""Mein Kampf"" this film should be published again in  Germany for history lessons, to understand, how a whole nation was  manipulated with georgous rituals like that.  Fateful is the sequence where  Hitler is speaking to his youth, the youngsters faces expressing idealism  without bad thoughts  and worshipping this man, believing everything what  he was saying.\nThomas";Hypnotic - powerful - the early days - springtime for Hitler
71;39.0;5.0;14.0;"Leni Riefenstahl's 1934 cinematic masterpiece ""Triumph of the Will"" still stands as an archetype of extraordinarily successful political propaganda. Made to capture the pageantry of the massive Nazi Party rally held in Nuremberg, just one year after Adolf Hitler rose to power through the office of chancellor, this film is also an important historical document. ""Triumph of the Will"" is a snapshot of a Germany arising out of the post-World War I malaise, a Germany preoccupied with installing a new system National Socialist government while preparing to spread its influence, not necessarily military influence at this point, far beyond its borders. Barely a whisper of anti-Semitism appears anywhere in the film, nor are there grandiose proclamations about subjecting huge swaths of Europe to Nazi rule. Riefenstahl's film appears to serve as a sort of introduction of the new German leaders to the rest of the world, as well as a paean to the wholesome, unifying effects of National Socialism on the German people. Of course, we know what happened just five years after the filming of ""Triumph of the Will."" It is, therefore, extremely difficult to watch this film without a prejudiced eye.\n\nThe first thing that strikes the viewer while watching the film is its beauty. Riefenstahl's film begins by showing the city of Nuremberg from Hitler's airplane as it prepares to land. What a beautiful place! The bird's eye view of the city is breathtaking, filled with images of majestic structures that evoke memories of quaint Old European landscapes that seemed to disappear for decades after the destruction caused by World War II. Even better are the numerous marches through the city streets, not because the actors involved are particularly interesting but because the camera often drifts away from the people to capture wondrous images of German architecture and artwork. The statues alone are superb. As weird as it sounds, ""Triumph of the Will"" reinforced my hope that I will one day visit Europe even if most of what we see here is long gone. You definitely don't need to condone what the Nazis did in any way, shape, or form to appreciate parts of Riefenstahl's film on a purely aesthetic level. It's too bad that the majority of ""Triumph of the Will"" focuses on the rather mundane aspects of National Socialist party politics.\n\nSpeeches form the crux of Riefenstahl's picture--lots and lots of speeches from lots and lots of Nazi party officials. The usual rogues appear here from time to time, including Martin Bormann, Josef Goebbels, Hermann Goring, Rudolf Hess, Reinhard Heydrich, Heinrich Himmler, Erich Raeder, and Julius Streicher. It is the last official, Streicher, that probably comes closest to articulating the centrality of racism to the Nazi philosophy in a speech about the importance of racial purity. Streicher, later sentenced to death at the Nuremberg trials, was the Gauleiter of Upper Franconia. But it was his role as editor of the notorious anti-Semitic rag Der Sturmer that carried his influence far beyond the end of World War II. Most of the speeches avoid Streicher's charged remarks, focusing instead on the importance of an ascendant Germany and the unity of the German people. Unity is everywhere in ""Triumph of the Will,"" from lengthy shots of Germans working together as groups to parades showing different classes of society marching together. Hitler and his cronies continually stress the importance of every individual and his or her place in the larger country, from the farmers to the children to the military. One important sequence shows individual Germans shouting out the names of their home regions, thus showing how all parts of Germany support the new regime.\n\n""Triumph of the Will"" is obviously a controversial film. Riefenstahl, who recently died at the ripe age of 101, bore a heavy burden for her National Socialist propaganda pieces right up to the end of her life. Critics accused her of glorifying a regime that started a war resulting in the deaths of tens of millions of people. In many respects, these critics score solid hits. No one who could read can deny that Hitler and his henchmen advocated war and organized murder as legitimate political tools even before the NSDAP came to power. ""Mein Kampf"" lays out Hitler's views on government and the Jews in no uncertain terms, and that book arrived on the scene years before the Nazis took over the German government. The aforementioned Julius Streicher's views on Jews were both vicious and well known long before Riefenstahl made her films. Der Sturmer began publication in 1923, according to Randall Bytwerk's incisive study of Streicher's career, and it leveled attacks against Jews almost from the beginning. How could Riefenstahl claim ignorance of the real agenda of Nazi leaders? I think a possible answer, if there is one, lies in the fact that her films came out at the beginning of Nazi rule, before the war and before the genocidal campaigns tarnished the heady early years when recovery from the shame of Versailles and the reemergence of Germany as a European power seemed pure and relatively harmless.\n\nThe debate over whether Leni Riefenstahl was a loyal Nazi or a dispassionate observer will rage forever. Her talents as a filmmaker, however, are abundantly clear. The extras included on the DVD are definitely worth a watch and a listen. A commentary track by historian Anthony Santoro provides a wealth of information on the subtle themes in the film as well as background on the obscure party officials appearing in the film. A Riefenstahl short film, ""Day of Freedom,"" captures a German military exercise staged for the benefit of thousands of citizens.

The pictures are crisper than the VHS copy I own, and this version has the added benefit of an audio commentary and a Leni Riefenstahl short film called ""Day of Freedom."" The audio commentary is like a historian sitting with you and explaining all the idiosyncracies of the featured members of the Nazi Party. He tells you who the key players in the film are, what they did during the war, and how they died. Some from old age, and some through execution or suicide. It is truly an educational experience for the dedicated film fan, and one that you should not miss.\nI must say that if you are hesitating to purchasing this film due to its subject matter, fear not. While the film is propagandist garbage, the cinematography is the real reason to buy it. Maybe most important of all, portions of each DVD sale go to the National Halocaust Museum in Washington D.C.

47;42.0;5.0;13.0;"Having seen ""The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl"" I thought I had seen ""Triumph of the Will.""  Right at the beginning of Ray Mller's documentary (1993) a shot of marching Nazis from ""Triumph"" is juxtaposed with a large school of little pink fish from the footage for Riefenstahl's recent ""Underwater Impressions"" and the effect is rather funny.  The marching monsters still look scary enough but the school of fish immediately puts this impression into a comical perspective.\n\nLittle did I know!  The 1993 documentary contains many sections from ""Triumph"" but the effect of watching ""Triumph of the Will"" (""Triumph des Willens,"" 1935) in its entirety is very different indeed.  Forget about comical perspectives. With the exception of a cat catching a glimpse at the Fhrer, Riefenstahl's film of the 1934 Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg, financed by the Nazi Government and commissioned by Hitler himself, is serious.  Monumentally serious.  Perspectives projected by the film, which ""doesn't contain a single reconstructed scene"" (Riefenstahl), are accumulated in the style and service of the militaristic ceremonies they document and surely with the intend to inspire awe.  Quite organically in fact does Riefenstahl's mis-en-scene grow out of the Nazi rhetoric itself, the goose-stepping shadows of marching SA men reinforcing her imagology in the same way as the flashy gestures of the orators reinforce the aggressive delivery of their screamed slogans.  ""Sieg - Heil; Sieg - Heil; Sieg - Heil!!!"" ""Argumentum ad nauseam"" is indeed a technique of propaganda generation and if a self-proclaimed ""artistic documentary"" starts to mimic the cultivated stupidity of the documented it should not only be accused of collaboration with organized idiocy;  it should be accused of the ultimate achievement: of having crystallized the images of banal militaristic rhetoric into something glorious and sumptuous, a colossal apotheosis of power and kitsch.  Hitler Kitsch.  It is the ""divine"" presence of the Fhrer which is towering above the elevated center of this carefully constructed montage.  ""The party is Hitler!"" screams Deputy Fhrer Rudolf Hess. ""But Hitler is Germany, as Germany is Hitler!"" Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Fhrer -- und ein Film.\n\nIronically though ""Triumph of the Will"" is a very interesting film if seen by a moderately educated  viewer today.  Our knowledge of WWII, the images of Nazi atrocities, holocaust, concentration camps, etc., which have become part of the collective memory, and last not least our over-saturation with modern propaganda and advertisement function quite effectively as the ""de-kitsching"" distance which the film itself fails to provide.  While our senses will still be numbed our minds can no longer be seduced.  Riefenstahl claims that she was not really interested in the political content of the speeches and presented the  chosen sections entirely for the dramatic impact which she observed from the gestures as well as from the degree of audience enthusiasm.  We can thus witness an impressive collection of rhetorical climaxes in very quick succession and this allows us to understand the essential Nazi gesture. ""A people that does not protect its racial purity will perish!"" screams Gauleiter Julius Streicher his massive bald head filling the entire screen.  His hand stretches out imploringly on ""people,"" clenches into a fist on ""purity"" and, in a powerful cadence, crushes down on us with ""perish.""  He must have rehearsed this ""pure"" martial gesture a thousand times in front of a mirror.  The Nazi rhetoric is basically a rhythmic tour de force.  While completely ignoring strength of argument or logic, it concentrates entirely on accumulation of powerful slogans, sound bites, cadences and the complete elimination of ""weak"" gestures.  It is a highly ritualized rhetoric of archaic, of brutal, of bombastic mantras--a militaristic rhetoric which is used as a weapon against the chaos of ""decadent"" democracy.\n\nKitsch, in the totalitarian realm of Nazi aesthetics, is the absolute denial of weakness.  Interestingly an earlier Riefenstahl ""propaganda documentary"" of the 1933 Nazi Party Congress (""The Victory of Faith,""  ""Der Sieg des Glaubens"") shows many technical problems and frequently exposes Hitler in awkward moments.  Interviewed by Guy Mller Riefenstahl appeared to be genuinely furious about this (60 years later!) and refused to even call it a film.\n\nThis special edition also features Riefenstahl's short ""Day of Freedom"" (""Tag der Freiheit,"" 1935) about the Wehrmacht, very similar stylistically to ""Triumph,"" as well as historian Dr. Anthony R. Santoro's excellent commentary.";Triumph of the Kitsch

The images are mesmerizing  as they showcase the might of Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler proves to be  the greatest orator in history. Though the ideology of National Socialism  and its contemporary adherents are now routinely ridiculed in most Leftist  academic circles, condemned by the Leftist media and denounced by the  general population, this great movie is testament to the power this  ideology once had and it still strikes fear into the hearts of those  viewers who oppose it.

59;44.0;4.0;13.0;People are ecstatic about this documentary. Sure, it is a good one : full of innovations and daring angles. Leni dared to do what other directors did not : putting her camera in people's face, looking at things in an active manner and not with the passive neutrality of a robot. I am sure she would  have done exactly the same  job if she had been American and the Republican Party had a huge political rally in Washington DC. But she was German and the rally was Nazi, so since then she has been prosecuted, harrassed and vilified. Poor Leni, she was not a Nazi, just an ambitious woman who believed in her job, filming. Triumpf of the Will must be taken for what it is : a very good documentary even if it does exalt the Nazi regime. As somebody said, men talk about it,  women feel it. She did.  But I would not qualify Leni as an artist : she lacked the distance, the critical approach of the subject that make real artists. She was basically a very gifted sycophant who jumped on the band wagon. Fascinated by powerful bodies and the violence they express, she fell in the Nazi trap. She must not be criticized for her opinions but for her lack of lucidity. Arno Breker and Albert Speer fell in the same trap, both paid dearly for that, Leni got away with it, probably because she was a woman.;Good documentary
36;45.0;5.0;12.0;"It is far from easy to review such material! I only wish the star grading were optional. Several people here have already noted the talent of the film-maker and how she conceptualized on film, and revolutionized, what has come to pass as propaganda.\n\nI was interested more in the documentary side of this film--I wanted to have a glimpse at the Sixth Congress of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, which took place in Nuremberg between September 4 and 10, 1934. For the astute scholar of the totalitarian regimes, this is an interesting and revelatory work. Here are some quickly drawn observations:\n\nHitler does not quite have all the power in the state, he speaks as if he has 90% of it and ALL his acolytes speak of him as if he is God-sent;\n\nHitler speech sounds cryptic/messianic and even banal at times (not only in comparison to the highly rhetorical Gobbles);\n\nHitler starts with good voice but soon turns to screeches;\n\nHitler's language about the mission of the German people is still about peace, not belligerent, yet mobilizing;\n\nHitler seems to want to make, and achieve, a deeper contact with the individual when he greets the troops;\n\nHitler has extremely well studied gestures;\n\nThe SA vs. SS power struggle is still going on with Hitler lying about how much he owes and likes the former;\n\nThe SA folks (and leader) look noticeably less than the SS;\n\nThere are visible security forces planted between the enthusiastic attendees and Hitler;\n\nThe classless society is exulted;\n\nRelentless indoctrination of the populace starting with the thousands of German youth in attendance;\n\nFuture troops march uniformed, holding just shovels--according to the Versailles Treaty, Germany is allowed little re-militarization;\n\nVery few shows of the mechanization in the German armed-forces--history tells us that it was taking place at full capacity;\n\nThe enthusiasm of the thousands of people involved seems genuine, it is quite difficult to detect the rigidity present in similar gatherings in former communist countries or in China. The bystanders do not seem equally enthusiastic, but show genuine interest (and probably hope?);\n\nGreat sense for how to dominate the populace through symbols, mystic, and ritual;\n\nHard to come up with any indication about how educated/intelligent Hitler is--there are some book reviewers here claiming just this. It is more obvious he is surrounded by some very smart people;\n\nThe members of the German government come all to praise Hitler. With few exceptions, they give up all dignity in the process, yet Hitler manages to keep his composure;\n\nThe heads of the German justice praise Hitler's total power over the (justice) system--scary moment indeed.\n\nSo, for the student of totalitarian systems, this is a good document that shows some of the elements present in early totalitarian systems. Deceit to the largest extent, populace falling for pomp and lies, elites bending to extremes for power (to please and get a piece of it), most checks and balances (internal and external) either play along or are crushed, and a certain type of individual at a certain time and in a certain place. The rest is history, which if not learned from will repeat itself...";document for the student of totalitariansim
67;46.0;5.0;13.0;Coming from Holland most information about the war we get to see is politically correct history about how the good guys were o so heroic, we were opressed and how utterly evil the Germans were.\n\nWhile I'm not saying Germany weren't wrong I do feel their side is being ignored in the history books. Good history informs about all sides. All aspects. Therefor I think this movie is very very good. It shows an aspect of the war we rarely get to see. Also the way it is executed is brilliant. The use of music and great scenes is awesome. I love it. Very gripping and powerful stuff.;Very impressive..
68;47.0;5.0;13.0;"The opening music to this film would not be out of place in any American Saturday morning serial, which were very popular in movie theaters in the 1930s, since this most famous of propaganda films was made contemporaneously. Like those serials, words only appear for about a minute after the opening title, words which ""remind"" the German-speaking audience of events which were only too familiar to them at the time: that the Great War had begun only 20 years before, that Germany's ""suffering"" had begun 16 years before and that Germany's ""rebirth"" had begun a mere 19 months before.\n\nThe ""rebirth"" alluded to the coming of power of the film's main attraction, Hitler, who presided over the Sixth Congress of the National Socialist German Workers' Party which took place in the historic city of Nuremberg between September 4 and 10, 1934. Though Hitler had been in supreme power for only a few weeks after the death of former army chief of staff, President von Hindenburg (1847-1934), it is made abundantly clear just what affection most people seen in the film had for this man. The scenes of cheering civilians lining the streets as the Fuhrer was driven to his hotel are quite thought-provoking, given that it is all too easy to remember what Hitler really intended for the German people in spite of his very public orations, in which he emphasized strength and unity of ""all"", even if certain minorities were, of course, never meant to be included.\n\nSeven decades have now passed since Riefenstahl and her staff captured this propaganda event on film, and the film has served as a testament to how a people was collectively ready to embrace an ideology and its leader, since both it and he had brought them to a stage in their nation's history where they could show the world just how strong Germany had become just 16 years after the end of the Great War, after which the victorious Allies had extracted an extremely high price for Germany's aggressive foreign policies.\n\nNow that Hitler was the supreme ruler, he meant to take Germany forward in a way that would mean that all Germans would be made responsible for their part. An indication of just how many people were supposed to be involved in all this can be gained from the scenes involving the Hitler Youth and other youth organizations (see the thousands of tents lined up in hundreds of rows, as seen from the air), the Reich Labor Service men bearing their spades and stating where in Germany they hailed from, and, of course, the thousands of storm-troopers and army soldiers, who filled the stadium to hear Hitler's speeches.\n\nEven here, Hitler's power as an orator is clear. He shines over everybody else, as he makes his impassioned speeches, reminding his audience of where they have been, where they are now, what they must do to continue to make Germany strong, and where Germany is heading. At one point, deputy Fuhrer Rudolf Hess proclaims that Hitler is the ""guarantor of peace"", yet that seems utterly incongruous when he immediately leads the assemblage into shouting ""Sieg Heil!"" no less than three times before Hitler steps onto the podium. Once Hitler has finished and Hess steps back on, it is clear that the audience is rapt and that, for a moment, Hess himself is speechless and hesitant, conveying the idea that, as a speaker, nobody could remotely touch Hitler.\n\nEven in 1934, Hitler's society is very much a military-industrial machine, although agrarian society is represented in the film, as men, women and children from the countryside are seen in traditional rural costumes, some of whom are presented to Hitler himself. However, the brevity of the screen time on their part indicates just how minor agriculture played in the scheme of things in Nazi Germany. If anything, the uniformed storm-troopers, SS men and army soldiers marching past Hitler's staff car in front of the Church of Our Lady in the centre of the historic city of Nuremberg serve to remind the audience of just how military-oriented Germany was even at that time.\n\nWhatever people may think of Riefenstahl as a film-maker, the fact was that she had a brief to cover as many aspects of the congress and its participants as possible, including aspects not immediately relevant, such as Nuremberg's historic architecture. The power of her finished product indicates that she was successful in doing what she had been briefed to do, and this is all the more remarkable, considering that women in Nazi society were largely encouraged to be homemakers and mothers, whereas Riefenstahl, a woman, had been given such a high responsibility to document the most important political event in Germany in 1934.\n\nWhether she was a fervent Nazi or a dispassionate observer, depending on one's point of view, Riefenstahl produced a film that can hardly fail to make people open their eyes to just how much influence the Nazi Party had in a country which could boast Beethoven, Brahms, Bach, Goethe, Schiller, Gutenberg, Kant, the brothers Grimm and Wagner amongst its most distinguished cultural and literary figures. Whether those images, which have endured seven decades and will continue to do so as long as Nazi Germany, as an entity, continues to remain within the public consciousness, can be seen as glorifying Nazism or, at the very least, as ""showing the highlights"" of the Congress, will also be subject to one's own viewpoint.\n\nRiefenstahl, who died in September 2003 aged 101, would always claim that she was ""mesmerized"" by Hitler and the Nazis, but that she was always a film-maker who made esthetics, rather than purely content, a primary concern. (She even released a film about underwater photography when she was 100 years old.) Nevertheless, ""Triumph of the Will"" (for which Riefenstahl won the gold medal at the World Exhibition in Paris in 1937, although the film itself is allegedly still banned in Germany even today) should serve as a lesson as to what happens when a people follows one person in what appears to be blind faith.";"Just a ""documentary"" as Riefenstahl intended it to be?"

38;52.0;5.0;11.0;"_Triumph of the Will_ (in the original German:  _Triumph des Willens_) is the most infamous propaganda film featuring the Nazis at the Third Reich's 1934 Nuremberg Party Rally by the notorious German film maker Leni Riefenstahl.  The movie obviously centers around the Nazi fascination with the all-powerful ""Will to power"" and attempts to show what can be accomplished by application of such Will to the political.  The film features such Nazis as Heinrich Himmler, Joseph Goebbels, Rudolf Hess, and Hermann Goering but most of its focus is directed at Adolf Hitler (""Der Fuerher"").  The basic point of the film seems to have been to propagandize for the National Socialists showing Germany as a great power and the strength of the German military and people.  The film also features appearances by the S.A., the S.S., and the ""Hitler Youth"", all praised by Hitler himself.  Most of the film consists of marches by the German stormtroopers, accompanied by music from Richard Wagner (beloved of Hitler) and the ""Horst-Wessel-Lied"" or party rallies with speeches by Hitler himself or other notorious Nazis.  The movie also shows much of the accompanying scenario of Germany at the time as well as featuring a scene in which farmers dressed in traditional garb present the fruits of their labors to Hitler.  Such appeals to tradition were common among the Nazis.  Throughout the film, the German male soldier/worker is presented as youthful, exuberant, strong, fertile, and powerful.  (Some of the scenes involving young German men frolicking, shaving, and even bathing while bare-chested could probably frankly be described as homoerotic.)  Hitler's speeches themselves (as well as the speeches of the other Nazis presented in this film) are powerful and disturbing.  Hitler explains his position and attempts to demonstrate the power of his party and nation.  At one particularly revealing point, Hitler states ""the state does not order us, we order the state!"".  At other times, various Nazi officials express the fact that ""Hitler is Germany"".  This sums up the cult of personality surrounding Der Fuerher.  (Hitler's uncanny ability to mesmerize the people during his speeches has been commented upon frequently.  Some have maintained that Hitler himself has an almost occult influence at such times.  Various theories have been suggested to explain how he came about such powers.)  Ironically, at no point in the film is a single anti-semitic phrase uttered.  This may have been intentional.  What can be seen from this film though is the power of the Nazi state and military.  Further, the esoteric elements of the Nazi party are present, including such features as the swastika and the bizarre cult surrounding the ""blood banner"" (the flag carried by the Nazis during the Beer Hall Putsch and revered by Nazis since that time).  Many have noted that the Nazi party itself may constitute a form of ersatz religion.  For example, the conservative theorist Eric Voegelin (who himself escaped from Germany at the time) has maintained that Nazism constitutes a ""political religion"".  Such quasi-religious aspects are certainly present in this film.  Ultimately though, to me at least, the film pointed out the lurking danger that may be found in all crowds and group-think.  Such a ""herd instinct"" overtakes many of those present in the crowd as their very selves merge with the rest of the crowd, the party, the nation, and the German people in pseudo-mystical union.  Thus, may be understood the mystical aspect of the National Socialist movement, and herein, partly lay its appeal.\n\nThe woman who made this film, Leni Riefenstahl (1902 - 2003), was an interesting enough person herself.  To begin with, one must note that for the time, this film represented an advance in film technique.  Indeed, the entire film is very well put together and effectively accomplishes its purpose in propagandizing for the Nazis.  Riefenstahl herself was a German film-maker who became fascinated by the Nazis for a time.  Later, she was to maintain that she was politically nave and largely ignorant of the sorts of crimes they were committing (whether or not she was being disingenuous on this point is obviously debatable).  After World War II, Riefenstahl was kept in a French detention camp for some time.  She was investigated for a period but never convicted during the de-nazification process.  Later, she would continue to produce other works of art, but ultimately she remains most (in)famous for this piece.\n\nThe movie itself is a disturbing one, ultimately, in light of the crimes of war.  It speaks to the danger of fanaticism.  Ultimately, despite the propaganda presented in this film, Hitler did not serve the German people well, and was to betray them at the very end (when many innocent Germans were butchered by Soviet soldiers).  This is to say nothing of course of Hitler's other, more notorious, crimes.";A Nazi Propaganda Film From the 1930s.

The true historical significance of Hitler and the Nazis is not well known.\n\nAn earlier reviewer ntioned that Germany was in a wretched state economically and morally when the Nazis started to vie for power. This cannot be denied. Nor can it be denied that Hitler repaired Germany's economy and in an astonishingly short period of time brought Germany to the forefront of world power.\n\nWhat is not understood is the true threat that Hitler posed. The 25 Points of the National Aryan Socialist Party were a list of goals that they wished to achieve. Number 11 clearly stated that they wished to eliminate interest banking; and felt that it was crippling Europe's economy. Of course they blamed the Jews: but this broad-stroke was clearly one of Hitler's failures and the genesis of his implemented genocide.\n\nWhat is significant is that once Hitler declared this; the international banking cartels realized that he was a threat to them. Any nation who seeks economic autonomy cannot be tolerated. In fact, almost all the wars that have been fought in the last two and a half centuries were merely business deals gone sour.\n\nHitler never wanted war with England. It was in Churchil's interests to instigate war, owing to his being a puppet for the international financial elite.\n\nHaving said that, there is the quality of the nation-state, and its upliftment wherein Hitler was a pioneer and trailblazer. He was the first to use the technological method to achieve his aims. He was the first human being to appear on a public TV broadcast, he used radio and TV and in this case, cinema, to great effect. The holocaust was distinctive only in that it was the worlds first application of technological method towards genocide (unfortunately, not the last).\n\nWatching his speech in this movie was a lesson in the manipulation of public opinion: and in human psychology. There was, within Hitler and his methods, a cynicism and utter contempt concerning the general state of the people. Consider the following quotes:\n""I reserve reason for the few, and emotion for the many""\n""If I approached my audiences with reasoned arguments, they wouldn't understand me. Their intelligence is small. I must reduce my philosophies to four or five very simple points which I repeat over and over again, until my words become like commands under hypnosis""\n\nThis is the general opinion he had of the majority of people. And if you examine any modern politician's speeches, they use the exact same methods of addressing their audiences.\n\nMs. Reinfenstahl's brilliant cinematography upheld this in an eloquent manner.\n\nHitler wrote the book on how to effectively set up and maintain a technological tyranny; and his techniques have proven effective - especially when his mistakes are avoided. He was just too obvious. Too much ego.\n\nWe can't say we weren't warned.";A Hard Lesson
13;55.0;5.0;8.0;"I've been asked in class by college students how and why the German people had become so enthralled by Hitler that they could have done what they did.  The reasons are complex:  the economy, anti-Semitism, war reparations, rampant inflation, etc.  The simple answer, however, may be found in this masterpiece film by Leni Riefenstahl.  Hitler descended from the clouds, put on one hell of a pageant, and spoke in such positive terms that a large number of people wanted to believe, having erased all feelings of doubt.\n\nEven after 65 years Hitler still is enormously fascinating to those who abhor what his demagoguery meant and to those who yearn for power without effort, without intelligence.  ""Triumph of the Will"" feeds both groups.  It is the music, those insistant drums, the orderly lines, the pageantry, and in the end, Hitler's raspy voice telling the people that their defeats and ills were not of their doing.  People want a true belief, Christianity, Islam, Communism, whatever:  something that might be worth dying for.  And Hitler provided that.\n\nVoltaire wrote that he who can make you believe an absurdity can make you commit an atrocity.  True belief is to never doubt.  We see it every day.  It is just that Hitler was able to draw upon that ultimately in an unstable time.  The ultimate question, then, is could ""Triumph of the Will"" happen again?  Ask yourself that.  The answer may trouble you for days.";Why Hitler?

A pity Hitler and the party turned out to be such war mongers as they created something missing from current day Earth.\n\nThe film is excellent as a historical piece. If your looking for an explaination why the whole of Germany followed Hitler like sheep then this movie is for you. Also would recommend watching ""The Fog of War"", then you can decide who the bigger criminals were in WW2.";A fantastic documentary
115;57.0;4.0;14.0;"If Stanley Kubrick had made propaganda films, ""Triumph of the Will"" would have been the result. Technically brilliant, visually stunning, this film documents a Nazi rally with all of the tools, tricks,  and art that film is capable of. If anyone had told me that I would ever  sit through a film about a Nazi rally and be entranced, I would have told  them that they were nuts. Like another film with a morally repugnant  message, Spike Lee's ""Do The Right Thing"", the director here is  so talented that the film mesmerizes even as all moral reservations and  judgments are swept aside by a tidal wave of filmmaking brilliance. The  speeches can bog the film down (although I found the closeups of these  monsters of the reich speaking to be fascinating) but you can always  patiently wait until the next amazing visual. Despite Reifenstahl's  lifelong, failed attempt to distance herself from the Nazi's, it is clear  that this is a love letter to them (and perhaps even to Hitler as there was  always those rumours, weren't there, Leni?...). This is a history lesson, a  cinematic tour de force, a warning about the deceptive powers of film, and  one of the most important films ever made by the only woman filmmaker who  can be put in the pantheon of great filmmakers without any apology. How  interesting that the greatest woman filmmaker should have politics so  disgusting. A bomb thrown in the playground of simpleminded feminists who  usually assume a greater natural benevolence and humanity in women simply  because of their sex.";"A stunning ""love letter"" to the Nazis"
26;58.0;5.0;10.0;"Before her death in 2003 at the age of 101, filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl would have you believe she had no affiliation with the Nazi party when she was asked by Adolf Hitler to document the momentous four days leading to the 1934 Nuremberg rally. However, it's obvious from her concurrently celebrated and reviled 1935 propaganda film that she was mesmerized by Hitler's oratorical skills judging from the dynamic way she has captured his undeniable charisma. She shows a remarkable deftness in editing techniques and camera movement and placement that remains the gold standard among documentarians. Riefenstahl succeeds in making Hitler a larger than life figure to the masses without resorting to editorial commentary to validate what is obvious from the images.\n\nThe film begins with Hitler's arrival in Nuremberg by personal aircraft where he is greeted by enthusiastic throngs of Nazi supporters. In fact, the first third of the film focuses primarily on civilian support of Fuehrer and then transitions to the opening of the Reich Party Congress where we see familiar historical figures, such as Rudolf Hess and Joseph Goebbels, speak. This leads to the third day of activity with rather unsettling shots of Hitler Youth as they prepare to greet Hitler from the rows of teepees in which they have camped. Her discriminating use of close-ups is most striking here when we see tow-headed Aryan boys hypnotized by Hitler's speech. The film ends with the startlingly choreographed rally with the famous shot of Hitler, flanked by Heinrich Himmler and Viktor Lutze, walking down an emptied aisle to place a wreath at a WWI memorial (a shot replicated by George Lucas at the end of the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars/dp/B000FQJAIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars</a>).

The 2006 Special Edition Synapse DVD contains a good though not outstanding print transfer. However, there are two worthwhile extras - the extremely informative commentary track from historian Dr. Anthony R. Santoro (which I recommend you switch on immediately to fully appreciate the individual personalities and historical details behind the rally) and a short Riefenstahl made at the following year's rally to celebrate the Wehrmacht (the German army), ""Day of Freedom"". There is little use in attempting any sort of objectivity about this film as it was intended to evoke strong emotions with the sole goal of solidifying the Reich in a country still feeling weakened from WWI. In this respect, Riefenstahl succeeds admirably.";Riefenstahl's Powerfully Cinematic Sensibilities Remain Noteworthy Despite the Controversial Subject
53;59.0;5.0;11.0;This film is the only one of its kind. A true historical achieve with the ability to communicate its message in the 21st century. The cinematic virtues of this film are obvious and have been well described by those with much more expertise on film history than myself. I wish to comment on the emotion and spirit of the film. This film is old by modern media standards,1930's Germany, but its motifes and content are almost mid-evil. The intensity and devotion of the National Socialists to their leader and their cause and the values they hold dear, blood ,nation ,soil are almost gone from the earth ,especially in the west. In fact it could be argued that was perhaps one of the goals of the allies in WWII to wipe away this ancient and powerfully seductive vision of human life. It certainly runs head long against so called representative democracy,and the utopian philosophies of Soviet communism. Both of these philosophies are idealistic and wedded to modern and post modern thought. The Nazis seem to come from another realm in comparison with their torches and banners ,eagles and svastikas. It is like watching a documentary on Atilla the Hun or Genghis Kan or Alexander the Great,where the followers place god-like faith in there leader and over everything hangs the air of mistery, exitement and dread. The most mindboggeling thing that one has to remind oneself while watching this film is that what they are watching is something real and not a Hollywood creation. One last time in the history of the world a god-man walked the earth and all the world will forever know his name, Adolph Hitler.;Exquiste, Deep and Powerful
10;60.0;4.0;7.0;"Leni Riefenstahl (1902-2003) began her career as a dancer, progressed to film roles, and ultimately moved into cinematography, editing, and directing.  Adolph Hiter was among her many fans, and although she herself was never a member of the Nazi party, Hitler asked her create a film about it.  Titled VICTORY OF THE FAITH, the 1933 film included significant footage of Ernst Rohm, and when he fell out of favor and was executed the film more or less died with him.  Only one copy survived, and it is rarely seen; even so, it developed the foundation for Riefenstahl's next film, a depiction of the 1934 Nazi Congress in Nuremberg. It was titled TRIUMPH OF THE WILL.\n\nMany records perished during World War II, and those pertaining to TRIUMPH OF THE WILL are not excepted.  Although she would later deny that the project was pre-planned in any real sense, Riefenstahl's crew consisted of 172 people, a number that could hardly be managed without considerable advance thought.  It also appears that Riefenstahl went to Nuremberg to have camera tracks and boom shot devices installed in strategic locations long before Hitler arrived.  Reifenstahl also deployed as many as thirty cameras from scene to scene, most them apparently predetermined positions, and one or two scenes have the sense of being actively directed.  Hitler and his entourage were certainly well aware that they were being filmed--and at times repeated portions of their speeches for the sake of a better camera shot. The organizers of the congress were instruced to be as camera-friendly as possible and even went so far as to dig ditches to allow Riefenstahl to get the shots she wanted.  Over the course of about four days, Riefenstahl and her crew shot an incredible sixty-plus hours of film.  Riefenstahl herself edited the film to a run time of two hours; even at this length, historians estimate that THE TRIUMPH OF THE WILL presents film footage showing about thirty thousand people.\n\nIn later years, Riefenstahl stated that Hilter had asked to make the film because she was apolitical and he wanted a film that would appeal to just such people.  He did not, Riefenstahl said, want a political film--and the film that she delivered is notable for that fact.  Ironically, the very absence of Nazi politics and policy makes them even more obvious than they might have been if they had been included, but Riefenstahl's emphasis is on imagery: impossibly large crowds, masses of flags, endless arrays of torches, incredible bits of scaffolding and rows of standard bearers.  TRIUMPH OF THE WILL is visually staggering to the same degree as such films as INTOLERANCE and THE BATTLE SHIP POTEMKIN.  Her editing is a grand affair, with exceptional tempo; her black and white imagery is extraordinary; her eye is indeed a great one, and although she made less than a dozen films, TRIUMPH OF THE WILL gained Riefenstahl the reputation as one of the greatest film artists of the 20th Century.\n\nThere is a notion that TRIUMPH OF THE WILL received universal critical acclaim when it opened in 1935.  That is not entirely true.  The film was a great success in Germany, won awards in Paris, and dazzled producers in Hollywood, but it received mixed reviews.  Most were impressed with the imagery and cinematography and editing, but some found the structure commonplace.  And of course, by 1935 the nature of Nazi Germany had become increasingly apparent around the world, and a good many people condemned the film for its visual glorification of the Nazi party.  And these criticisms have continued to this day, and I have to agree that the entire look of the film is essentially a flowering of fascist art.\n\nEven so, there is an irony to TRIUMPH OF THE WILL that not even Riefenstahl could have imagined: we know what will happen to these people who parade in the streets, who cheer and wave and dance and parade.  I was repeatedly caught by the young children who smiled and laughed.  How many of them, I wondered, lived?  They danced, many of them willingly, right into the mouth of hell with Adolph Hitler leading the way.  Seen at this level, and balanced against later documentaries such the shocking Army Signal Corps footage of the concentration camps and such feature films such as the 1979 KITTY: RETURN TO AUSCHWITZ--my God, but it is disturbing, deeply disturbing and incredibly sad.\n\nThere are a great many DVD releases of TRIUMPH OF THE WILL.  This review is of the ""Special Edition"" by Synapse Films, and includes a commentary by Dr. Anthony R. Santoro, which I found very erudite but perhaps somewhat dry.  It also includes a short Riefenstahl film, DAY OF FREEDOM, made to placate members of the military who felt TRIUMPH OF THE WILL had given then short shift; it too is remarkable for its imagery.  The elements have not been restored in a major sense, certainly not a digital sense, but the film is sharp enough for us to see the sweat on Hitler's brow, and the sound is quite good.  It is hard to recommend such film, but at the same time I feel everyone should see it at least once.  Evil wears a mask, and very often it is one of remarkable grace.  It is best to know that.\n\nGFT, Amazon Reviewer\nfor Nicky, faithful feline companion for a decade, gone before his time";Evil Can Wear A Mask: The Flowering of Fascist Cinema
85;61.0;5.0;12.0;No, the endless rows of troops and supporters are not special effects - they're the real thing in all their terror and power.  Nothing like this can be seen in the world today except maybe in North Korea.  This movie is a priceless historical document and a study in mass psychology and propaganda.  Hopefully, it will always stay in circulation, where it best serves as a warning against the power of charismatic dictators and blind devotion to The State, and unlimited power.\n\nMaybe it would be best if this movie was sold back-to-back with footage and photos of the horrors produced by Nazi Germany, and hopefully end with some photos of the Red Army's vicious three-day pillage of Berlin, where soldiers were given 'liberty without restraint,' to punish the Germans in the most horrific ways, and the Soviet propaganda footage of a gigantic concrete Nazi emblem being blown to smithereens by dynamite.  That way you could see the gross effect of Hitler's spell over Germany, and the absolute horror of war - Hell on Earth.\n\nIf you ever wondered how Hitler gained so much power, this movie will explain it to you.  A total loser and drifter for most of his young life, then-Corporal Hitler stumbled across his hidden talent as an orator when given an end-of-service assignment of preaching to troops exiting the defeated Werchmact about the dangers of communism.  His superiors immediately recognized his latent talents, and made more use of his speaking abilities.  From there he started his career in politics.  In 'Triumph,' Adolph Hitler is at his best - or worst.  Not only did Hitler have an amazing talent for public speaking, but he was a shrewd propagandist.  He once said that torchlight rallies were a favorite of his because it was easiest to bend people's will at the end of the day.  Anyone who looks at Germany and says 'that could never happen here,' is dead wrong.  All that's needed is a right ingredient mix of timing, politics, and the state of the human condition.  Then, add in a charismatic dictator, and watch the troops march and 'leftist' opposition get crushed on the road to nationalistic Armageddon.\n\nThis movie will silence anyone who says that protest isn't patriotic.  While the leaders of any nation would pee their pants to have millions of people screaming 'heil' at each of theis 'seigs,' we now know all too well the results of blind devotion to a leader.  This movie is all the warning we need.  Watch it, at least once, so that you can recognize the traits of nationalism, and so you can gain a better sense of propaganda and rhetoric.  Too many people can't identify truth from schpiel already!\n\nNotice this movie doesn't show anyone countering the Nazi movement.  That's because anyone 'liberal' enough to say war is bad, would have, at the time this movie was made, found themselves wearing a piano-wire necktie.\n\nWhile it's tempting to ban this movie outright because of the horrific acts of Nazi Germany, that would be a massive mistake.  Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\n\n-- JJ Timmins;A Historic Warning against the danger of POWER

113;63.0;5.0;13.0;After viewing this movie and taking a course on ww2 in college, I have come to the conclusion  (not that Germany was right) that it is understandable what happened in Germany during 1934. This film captures the  meaning behind national pride. The German Country was in complete tourmoil  and they did need a leader to get them out of a hole. Hitler did this for  the country and it is obvious that the Germans looked up to him, just as I  would look up to the leader of my country. This is some of the best live  footage I have ever seen in all of history and I strongly recomend it to  anyone with a interest in German history prior to WW2;Understandable
74;64.0;3.0;11.0;Directed by Leni Riefenstahl, this is a cinematic document of the 1934 rally at Nuremburg. Everyone who reviews the film says that, all politics aside, the artistry is breathtaking. And I agree: if you buy one piece of Nazi propaganda in your lifetime, you should definitely make it Triumph. But if you can, watch it on a double bill with Schindler's List or The Pianist so you know you're getting both sides of the story.\n\nThough this is obviously very old footage, the DVD transfer of both the audio and visuals is astonishing in its clarity. In fact, it was so vivid, when the pizza man knocked on my door during the opening credits, I nearly hid in the basement.\n\nAgain, there's no denying the technical brilliance of this film, but a movie designed to promote the Hitler agenda will never get the gold star of excellence from me.\n\nHappy viewing!;Oh Leni, you're so fine!

This film transcends any subject matter. In case you don't know, this is a propaganda film for the Third Reich and shows various events and speeches, and the German cityscape, people, and countryside. It's an odd movie and very expressionistic. Not what you'd normally associate with a propaganda film.\n\nIt is one of those rare films that resounds throughout artistically. It does so in a truly epic fashion. It's every bit as operatic as Wagner. It fuses audio and video in a way never seen before and rarely seen since. Just watch the opening descent sequence. It's jaw dropping. The music and the visuals are still inspiring. It conjures the descent of a god from heaven. It is truly the work of a master of the craft.\n\nThen watch the longshots. There aren't ANY cameras visible. Also, the staging (the films' speeches are almost entirely staged) of the speeches and the marches is mesmerizing (and obviously inspired several Star Wars scenes, btw like the throne room, etc). You can see visual quotes from this movie in hundreds, perhaps thousands of other films, a testament to its enduring filmic legacy.\n\nFeatures on this DVD include a commentary by a history professor, who serves to put everything in the proper historical perspective.

79;66.0;5.0;11.0;Regardless of the theme and propaganda aspect, Triump of the Will is one of the most important movies ever filmed.  It documents the 6th Reich Party Congress that was held in Nuremburg in 1934, and subsequently was awarded the Gold Medal in Venice in 1935, and the Gold Medal at the World Exhibition in Paris in 1937.  The crowning glory for Leni Riefenstahl, with the defeat of the Nazis in 1945, her association with the movie and several other Nazi propaganda films nearly destroyed.  Up until her death in September 2003, at the age of 101, she vehemently downplayed her association with the Nazis, and attempted to rebuild her reputation through still photography.  The nature of her involvement with the Nazis will never be fully known, so it can never be known for certain whether this film was, as Riefenstahl claims, a compromise so that she could continue to exercise her creativity.  Whatever the case, Triump of the Will is an important movie, both in terms of its influence on cinematography, and as a historical document.  It is a definite must-see for anyone who wants to understand the Nazis, as it epitomizes the regime's skilled use of propaganda to gain and maintain power.;A film of significant historical value

The people who went along with all this were the same people who read Goethe and listened to Beethoven...one of the most highly cultured, civilized people of recent history, proving that intelligence and education does not prevent brainwashing or political madness and evil.\n\nFilmed on September 4 - 10, 1934, there is tremendous symbolism used, starting with the aerial footage of Hitler arriving in Nuremberg, through the clouds, as though he were a god coming to save his people. For those who viewed this film in Germany during the mid to late '30s who had never been on an airplane, this footage must have been spectacular; also marvelous are the views of the city seen from the air, so much of it since bombed, and then re-built.\nLike all propagandists, Riefenstahl started with the message, and spliced and diced her film to fit it...she just did a better job of it than anyone else has since, and unfortunately, it ruined her career as a filmmaker, and as she would say later, it ""cast a shadow"" over her life,\n\nThe vastness of the scenes has never been achieved in any Hollywood epic...the ocean of saluting arms, the endless line of marching men, the sheer enormity of the ""Commemoration of the Dead"" ceremony, where Riefenstahl had cameras set up high for panoramic views, and where Hitler gave one of his fiery speeches.  There are also a multitude of happy, tow-headed children, strong, firm-jawed youths, and those salivating women looking at Hitler. This is a trip down the rabbit-hole, and a strong reminder that as George Santayana said, ""Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it"".\n\nIt is fascinating to watch this with the added commentary by historian Dr. Anthony Santoro, which sheds a lot of light on the events, as well as watching it with subtitles, and if you want to get the full impact, view it with no subtitles, just the German and the rather Wagnerian soundtrack.

The techniques she used are often used today, but the simple employment of camera angles and vistas combined with mesmerizng music tell the story that Hilter wanted told.  It is spectacular as an historical document and in its comparative simplicity it is a extraordinary opportunity to see how films, lenses, and proportion can be used to tell a story or spin a tale.  For me, it is the crystal ball that demonstrates how easy it is for genius to influence the masses and how this medium of visual imagery and music can persuade people in the millions to accept the leadership of a demagogue.;Triumph of Creativity

For real students of Nazism you won't learn much from the commentary, but it is good to hear a relatively unbaised straight forward accessment of what was going on in the movie. The commentary definately ads value even for students of Nazism IMO. For people who are not in depth students of Nazism, or who have many of the common misconceptions about Nazism, his comments don't go into detial enough, and in fact he really glosses over many of the more important points, just mentioning them as assides.\nHe goes over less important points many times(like the fact that all the people in uniforms were non-military), but there are several important points that if you ""blink"" you may miss, and he goes into no further detial, which could leave many people slightly confused, or drawing wrong conclusions.\nOverall though its still very good, and he treated the subject matter with the right degree of detachment in almost all cases, though I object to a few minor points, such as calling people ""evil"", which IMO has no place in any scientific or hisorical analysis, but those things were minor.\nThis is still a great DVD for everyone, but for non-students of Nazism it really needs more detail.

It was commissioned by Adolph Hitler himself and written and directed by Leni Riefenstal, then only 32 years old.  It's a full two-hours and celebrates and glorifies the Third Reich.  The film techniques are excellent, given the technology of the time.  I understand she used 30 cameras, more than a hundred crewmembers and 61 hours of film.  There are shots obviously taken from a helicopter with great views of the clouds.  There are distant shots that take in more than 200,000 people.  And close-ups that show the love and adoration that the populace felt for Hitler, who had just become the dictator the year before.  I\nMostly, there are crowd scenes and speeches by Hitler himself as well as Goebbels, Goring, Hess, Himmler and other villains of the Nazi era which was then a rising political movement.  It was several years before the war machine was fully in place as the Nazis didn't march into Poland until 1939.  So, at the time the film was made, there was nothing but joy, especially since just a few years prior to that Germany was immersed in a depression that was so bad that people were paid twice a day because the value of money changed  from hour to hour that the price of a loaf of bread could double from morning to afternoon.\nIt's an eerie feeling to sit in the comfort of my rocking chair and travel seven decades back in time.  The young people in the Hitler Youth movement reminded me of boy scouts as I watched them horse around and splash water on each other like any other high-spirited teenagers.  The small children are all smiling as their parents hold them up to catch a glimpse of Hitler.  And the adults themselves seems to be in an ecstatic trance as they raise their arms in a ""Heil Hitler"" salute.  I couldn't help but think if any of them are still alive, and how deceived they must be about the early promise of their youth, and how much devastation it caused for everyone.\nThen there were the speeches, always with the utmost theatrical fervor.  I read the subtitles carefully.  What was Hitler and the others really saying?  Yes, they spoke of glory.  But they also spoke of themselves as being the party of peace and being told by God that this was their destiny.  Surprisingly too, they all seemed to believe it.  I had also expected to see more anti-Semitism in their speeches.  Jews were never mentioned and although there was some reference to racial purity, it didn't seem to be the leading issue in 1934.\nBasically, the film was one big show of pageantry and pep rally for what would come later.  Looking back on in in 2003, it gives me the chills.\nFor students of history, this is an important film.  Others will be horrified.  And many will be bored as there are no actors and no plot except to glorify their leader.";Historically significant,  but it gave me the chills.
23;74.0;5.0;8.0;This is the infamous documentary produced by Leni Riefenstahl of the 1934 Nazi Party rally in Nuremberg, Germany. Working with an unlimited budget, she created the almost perfect propaganda film to promote the Nazi Party in Germany. Fascinating today, just for the historical interest, it has been the model over the decades for others wanting to understand the power of propaganda film. It was a powerful influence in establishing Hitler as the messiah for Germany. It was shown in part or whole in every theater throughout Germany during WWII. Of course, today we see it thru the lens of history and the unspeakable evil that was committed by Hitler and his regime but the people watching in 1934 did not have that insight. At the very least, it is a powerful warning to those of us who have the benefit of history to be more discerning in our falling for those who would seek to use this same kind of propaganda to push a cause, no matter how noble or good it might seem and the Nazi Party certainly seemed to be a noble cause for the German people. Riefenstahl used 30 cameras and 120 technicians during the filming. Hitler was always filmed separately so he could be edited in and out of the crowd pictures for maximum manipulation of imagery and seduction of the mind. While it runs a little long and is a little repetitive in places, this is an amazing piece of history and very much worthwhile of your time. WWW.LUSREVIEWS.BLOGSPOT.COM;PUT YOURSELF IN THEIR SHOES!!

56;76.0;5.0;9.0;"This movie is a masterpiece. You do, however, have to approach it with the right frame of mind.\n\nIt's very similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey, in that it's an EXPERIENCE rather than being a MOVIE. The same ones who were bored with 2001: will be bored here, too. Not much happens; Triumph of the Will is a documentary with very little plot. The  viewer needs to try to watch it in the spirit of the times, and try to absorb everything that is going on. If you're expecting a high-action movie, better skip this one.\n\nPrevious reviews have intellectualized the movie. While this has tremendous merit, viewers who haven't seen the movie don't really know what to expect when they buy it.\n\nIt starts out with Hitler coming out of the Clouds like some demi-god. He lands the plane, exits to a hysterical crowd, and travels through a spectacularly beautiful Nuremberg to get to the Events. You get to see volumes of ecstatic German populace worshipping him, while you worship the beautiful scenery. Too bad it's gone now.\n\nThen, you see preparations for the event. Schoolkids sleeping in tents, frolicking around, having a good time, eating, washing up each other in the shower, etc. (One does get a feeling of some nascient homoeroticism).\n\nThe movie then moves into the Festivities.\n\nYou watch massive formations of humans--perhaps 200,000 of them, alternately marching in formation, forming spectacular displays of choreography, avowing their reverence for the Fuhrer--while interspersed with speeches made by leading Nazis. The choreography is hypnotic, mesmerizing--it'll remind you somewhat of those Busby Berkely movies from the 30s. And the speeches aren't boring, at least to me--you see glimpses of the German mindset before all the bad stuff happened in WW2. They only last about 15 minutes, anyway.\n\nAll this eventually segues into several minutes of marching. This might bore the viewer; it does seem to go on and on.\n\nMs. Riefenstahl has said that she was forced to direct the music herself; the marches (and the music) were all out of sychronization, so, at her hands, the music alternately speeds up and slows down to the marching. If you watch these sequences with this in mind, and pay attention to the music--you'll find the marching not at all boring, and short-lived, even.\n\nAll this pageantry ends with a short speech by Hess--""Hitler is Germany!"", etc. It's a rousing finale.\n\nI was utterly absorbed by this movie, and have seen it three times. Highly recommended!";A New Approach to this movie
63;77.0;4.0;9.0;"Triumph of the Will, is a great documentary especially for the time  it was created.  Its masterfully created, and puts into prospective how the German people followed such a murederous regime through brain washing and excellent propganda.  Some may find this film to be boring, but true WWII enthusiasts will absoultly love the authenticity of the product.  The film included excellent footage of Adolf Hitler and his ""goons"" as each regime member makes statements at the Nuremburg Nazi Rally which include Hess, Goebbles,etc.  The english commentary in my opinion is awful, as there is no enthusiasm in the narration.  If the narrator, was at all good I would have given the review a 5 ***** rating however, you can always turn the narration off using the DVD film options.\n\nIf your interested in Hitler, the Nazi regime, or WWII you will LOVE this film.

65;78.0;5.0;9.0;For anyone who is doubtful that films can be considered as an art form, this one will prove otherwise. Leni Riefenstahl is without doubt one of the most talented directors ever. She can capture both the sublime and the grandiose so movingly and beautifully, that one gasps for breath watching this movie. Indeed, she belonged to a party that among other things, threw babies alive into fiery pits. I am not here to judge her as a person. But, as a moviemaker, she is pure genius.;Took my breath away!

28;80.0;3.0;8.0;"To write a review or to even discuss Leni Riefenstahl I think is a tricky subject. I don't have to tell most people she is a controversial figure. Yet most people struggle between throwing praise at her work while keeping in mind the content of her work. In a way it is relateable to her ideas that politics and film are seperate.\n\n ""Triumph of the Will"" basically shows us a Nazi rally a year after Hitler and the National Socialist Party have taken power. And unless you have the volum turned off, I don't think it is terribily difficult to tell this man could cause lots of trouble.\n\n But what about the way Riefenstahl films the rally. From the opening shot when the heavens bring us Hitler as a massive crowd awaits their leader, Reifenstahl hits home the idea of power within the party and the German people. And that's the most prevelent element in all of Riefenstahl's work. Strenght in numbers, discipline and youth. We get a lot of that in this documentary.\n\n Is Riefenstahl right though that politics and film are two different things? In theory, yes. Film and politics are two different things but some would argue society inspires an artist. We are all products of our environment. Yet Riefenstahl says she was not a memeber of the Nazi party. She says her only intention was to make a good film. Was she really a Nazi? I have no way of knowing. She says she wasn't, so we can only take her at face value, although if not a Nazi, she was at the very least a Nazi sympathizer. And she was greatly impressed by Hitler. But how could she and so many other people not pick up on the dangers of the party? Just listen to Hitler's nationalist speeches, they reek of world domination. And this was years before the start of WW2.\n\n Should you see the piece of Nazi propaganda though? There is definitely an element of historical curiosity to it. And it is well made, but, so what? I'm reminded of a line in ""Annie Hall"" when Woody Allen tries to take Diane Keaton to see ""The Sorrow and the Pity"". She tells him ""I'm not in the mood to see a three hour documentary on the Nazis.""\n\n If you do chose to see this you will probably be interested to see some of her other work. None of them is quite as ""good"" as this. Assuming there is such a thing as ""good Nazi propaganda"". With ""Triumph of the Will"" we see her growth as a director. Compare her work here to films such as ""Victory of Faith"" or ""Day of Freedom"". She really came into her own with this documentary. And I don't know if that is a good thing or bad.\n\n Bottomon-line: Interesting documentary in a historical perspective but so what? Is it worth watching? Maybe. Ask yourself, ""Am I in the mood for a two hour documentary on Nazis""?";Springtime For Hitler

105;83.0;5.0;10.0;Leni is a genius, no doubt at all about that.  The way she captured the endless ranks of uniformed marching Nazi party faithfuls is little short of, well, fascinating (pardon der pun!).  She pioneered many cinematic techniques in this film about the Nazi Party Day in Nuremberg, and the movie is brilliant from a technical point of view.  The fact that it was about the Nazis was purely an incident of history - she could have easily made the movie as a commission by the Republican Convention in the US had she been in the States at that time!  It is a case of towering talent harnessed by a political force which then turned out very very badly and then failed. Watch this movie, no doubt about it, you will feel viscerally the elemental force of Leni's genius on screen.  This documentary's near-myth-like greatness is only matched by the notoriety of the cause it mistakenly championed (but that's only with the benefit of 20/20 eyesight retrospect - at the time this film was made, could anyone say for sure Hitler was going to turn out so monstrously disasterous for the German people and the world at large?  Can anyone honestly?)  The most eerie and poignant part of the film was when it introduced the Nazi party luminati on stage one by one with sub-titled names:-  to reflect on their eventual fate with the knowledge which we now do of course, and to see a filmatic record of them at the zenith of their highly charismatic careers and the height of the seductive powers of Nazism, truly brings home the Taoist truism that everything is ultimately futile, not to mention the the proverb that the road to hell is paved with the best of intentions.

It captures all of the splendor and wonder of the Third Reich, as well as providing a tantalizing, though incomplete, glimpse into the National Socialist ideology. Aside from the astounding film techniques, the content is riveting, the speeches are hypnotic (Hitler's, at least,) and the rallies are overwhelming.\nWhile I understand that most people who watch this film will go into it with many pre-conceived notions, it is best viewed with an open mind. Rather than seeing it as a propaganda film, which it was not, by the way, view it as you would a documentary.\nRegardless, whether your believe in the National Socialist ideology or not, this film is a masterpiece, as is shown by the numerous 5 star reviews it has been given.

I don't think so, because I didn't fail to appreciate, for instance, ""M"", 1931 film by Fritz Lang, his Metropolis (1927), or, say, Russian films Okraina (1933) and Bespridannitsa (1937), or Japanese A Story of Floating Weeds by Ozu, as well as many other films produced before 1940.\n\nAs art of propaganda ""Triumph Of The Will"" does not do its work well either. In the first half, where Riefenstahl shows famous Nazi torch parades, one can barely see what's happening on screen. It looks more like not so large a forest fire than an organized night event with torches. Much more smoke than fire can be seen. The second half of the film is plain boring, with countless militray and paramilitary units marching and marching and marching through the streets and squares of Nuremberg.\n\nAs to the content - I tried to watch this film without any prejudice, but nevertheless found all participants, from the lowest to the highest rank, rather uninspiring.\n\nAesthetics of the Nazi party congress look cheap and tastless in the film. I know that Hitler was able to consolidate the nation, brought to unspeakable misery by the countries which prevailed in the First World War, but I could not find in this film any indication of his famous oratorial skills.

110;88.0;5.0;9.0;Leni Riefenstahl's film is an invaluable historical document. Through filming of the Nuremberg Rally and other central moments of the build-up of  the Nazi regime, she inadvertently showed how mass hysteria can subvert an  entire nation's morality. She also created, no matter what her motive, a  cinematic masterpiece, which can be put alongside the films of Eisenstein,  Pabst, Lang and Griffith as the bricks and mortar of modern cinema.  The  Synapse web site suggests they have made a lot of effort in gaining the  best print available of this film. They are letterboxing it with a small  black border around the entire image  so we see everything that Leni framed  for the cinema screen. See it, be abhorred by its content, but appreciate  its cinematic genius.  I hope this is followed by her even greater film  'Olympia', her documentary of the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Hitler meant the  Games to be a celebration of Aryan supremacy. Leni turned it into a paean  of admiration for the great black athlete, Jesse Owens. And to counter the  nazi-regime image presented in both films, let's hope one enlighted company  brings to DVD the early '30s film by Pabst of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt  Weill's Der Dreigroschenoper (The Threepenny Opera), which, as well as  bringing us Lotte Lenya and Mack the Knife, was a key part in the early  fight in Germany between Nazism and socialism.

48;90.0;5.0;7.0;Triumph of the Will is overwhelmingly powerful in its portrayal of nationalist unity unlike any I have ever known. Riefenstahl's use of neon lighting as an introduction for each major party official is almost subliminal, and by such technique is one pushed into watching attentively as something critically important is about to occur. Her stylized direction resembles so many maneuvers common in modern films today (which I regrettably take for granted), and I suddenly begin to understand why so many movies about militaristic empowerment/unity are accordingly so effective--they are based not only on documented propaganda, but propaganda of a political faction that was extraordinarily successful when skimming through the annals of history. One really ought to step outside themselves when watching Triumph--to really focus on this document's power to not only characteristically show why the Nazi party was so appealing (because of Goebbel's seductive use of suggestion in all forms of propaganda, including this film which he realized quite entirely), but to transform the minds of clean-slated Germans viewing this film in theatres at that historical moment. Such an event in history cannot (and assuredly will not ever) be forgotten. It is breathtaking to see how people can be so easily manipulated into thinking something so flawed is ultimately perfection materialized. This just may be our only effective link to such a heinous (and equally awe-inspiring) time in human history. I have looked forward to seeing this film for about six months now, and when I finally witnessed its unfolding, I came to understand why it has ignited so much debate and scholarly discourse. If you appreciate film and its influence upon the mind (which is so easily swayed), then you must see Triumph of the Will--a friend of mine (who happens to be a film student) broached the topic of this movie not two weeks ago with me, and he explained just how crucial it was in his own area of study. In fact, I would recommend buying it as an elemental part of your movie collection. Everyone deserves history in their lives, and this is a form of history in its most intended form (from the Nazi perspective).

A legally elected party of a population of 70 million or so. Think Democrats or Republicans.\n\n2. Germany had 6 years of peace, ignoring the propaganda war by the USA/others, from 1933 thru 1939. Economic programs initiated by Adolf Hitler and the NSDAP created jobs and the Autobahn. Germany before 1945, under Adolf Hitler and the NSDAP, had their own Germanic culture, economics (Nationalizing of companies and such), and banking system - zero interest loans for starters.\n\n3. Poland.  A nation of 20 years created by the USA imposed ""Treaty of Versailles"". Poland was originally Germany for 200 years. Poland had two military dictators. The first dictator was OK with Adolf Hitler, non aggression pacts and agreements. The first one died and the second Polish military dictator was a menace. After all, the newly created nation of Poland had a blank check guarantee from England and France. Adolf Hitler was forced to take action against half of Poland. Poland was threatening Germany.  Russia invaded the other half two weeks later. Bottom line, the ""invasion"" of Poland was a REGIONAL conflict. Not worth a world war.\n\n4. Adolf Hitler was trying to save a nation called the German Empire united in 1871. WW1 and the Treaty of Versailles took advantage of a weak Germany. Germany was forced to accept territorial concessions - Poland and Czechoslovakia, 70 year fines, and military occupation. Much more than just the ""War Guilt Clause"". The ""Treaty of Versailles"" was all about control and redefining an independent European nation called the German Empire. In reality, Germany was fighting a 30 year war - 1914 thru 1945. Adolf Hitler was elected Reichspresident in 1933.\n\n5. Adolf Hitler, the NSDAP, and Germany before 1945 were the good guys. American GI's and the public were tricked into war with Germany. The anti German propaganda was downright silly at the time. And today.\n\n6. One must break free from culturally ingrained 70 years worth of propaganda. I have.\n\n7.

The landing is accompanied by throngs of ordinary people who call out his name as though he was a long-lost relative. The motorcade past the old somber buildings reflects Germany's past , while the parade presents Germany's future. To see these rapt children, teens and older adults in the light of history is to see those whom Hitler would most cruelly betray. Seldom has such evil been presented as messianic.

I just don't understand how The West thought he would not turn those ""robots"" lose on the west!\n\nEveryone ought to watch this film - so you will recognize when people are being mindlessly controlled.

66;104.0;5.0;6.0;"It is far from easy to review such material! I only wish the star grading were optional. Several people here have already noted the talent of the film-maker and how she conceptualized on film, and revolutionized, what has come to pass as propaganda.\n\nI was interested more in the documentary side of this film--I wanted to have a glimpse at the Sixth Congress of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, which took place in Nuremberg between September 4 and 10, 1934. For the astute scholar of the totalitarian regimes, this is an interesting and revelatory work. Here are some quickly drawn observations:\n\nHitler does not quite have all the power in the state, he speaks as if he has 90% of it and ALL his acolytes speak of him as if he is God-sent;\nHitler speech sounds cryptic/messianic and even banal at times (not only in comparison to the highly rhetorical Gobbles);\nHitler starts with good voice but soon turns to screeches;\nHitler's language about the mission of the German people is still about peace, not belligerent, yet mobilizing;\nHitler seems to want to make, and achieve, a deeper contact with the individual when he greets the troops;\nHitler has extremely well studied gestures;\n\nThe SA vs. SS power struggle is still going on with Hitler lying about how much he owes and likes the former;\nThe SA folks (and leader) look noticeably less than the SS;\nThere are visible security forces planted between the enthusiastic attendees and Hitler;\n\nThe classless society is exulted;\nRelentless indoctrination of the populace starting with the thousands of German youth in attendance;\n\nFuture troops march uniformed, holding just shovels--according to the Versailles Treaty, Germany is allowed little re-militarization;\nVery few shows of the mechanization in the German armed-forces--history tells us that it was taking place at full capacity;\n\nThe enthusiasm of the thousands of people involved seems genuine, it is quite difficult to detect the rigidity present in similar gatherings in former communist countries or in China. The bystanders do not seem equally enthusiastic, but show genuine interest (and probably hope?);\nGreat sense for how to dominate the populace through symbols, mystic, and ritual;\n\nHard to come up with any indication about how educated/intelligent Hitler is--there are some book reviewers here claiming just this. It is more obvious he is surrounded by some very smart people;\nThe members of the German government come all to praise Hitler. With few exceptions, they give up all dignity in the process, yet Hitler manages to keep his composure;\nThe heads of the German justice praise Hitler's total power over the (justice) system--scary moment indeed.\n\nSo, for the student of totalitarian systems, this is a good document that shows some of the elements present in early totalitarian systems. Deceit to the largest extent, populace falling for pomp and lies, elites bending to extremes for power (to please and get a piece of it), most checks and balances (internal and external) either play along or are crushed, and a certain type of individual at a certain time and in a certain place. The rest is history, which if not learned from will repeat itself...";good document for the student of totalitariansim
24;105.0;5.0;5.0;"To begin with, merely discussing this film in open society, or among those conversant with film history and theory, often serves as the beginning of arguments rivalled only by mentioning Birth of a Nation.  Attempting to review the film can only compound the problem.  So, one must look at Riefenstahl's film in light of what it intends to accomplish, and how effective it is in doing so.  To answer the first question, any film that attempts to rationalize National Socialism is morally questionable, to say the least.  However, did Riefenstahl know this at the time this film was made?  The evidence would argue that she didn't.  While she couldn't have been unaware of the anti-Jewish rhetoric of the Nazi party, she may very well have been unaware of the extremity of that political party's ethnic hatred.  Riefenstahl was commissioned to produce a celluloid document that would contribute to the cultural standing of the Nazis, and she did exactly that in her depiction not only of Hitler as a ""god"" descending from the heavens to rescue Germany, but also through the sheer power of the sequences in which masses of soldiers move in exact synchronization.  Through images pastoral and industrial in origin, Riefenstahl weaves a tapestry that, for the moment of viewing, comes within a hair's breadth of achieving what the Nazis desperately wanted:  acceptance by the world outside Germany.\nThe cinematic accomplishment of Triumph of the Will can be noted by one barometer:  The film was considered to be so effective in its method and argument that it was banned from exhibition in the U.S.A. during the Second World War.  Now, Riefenstahl's film was not alone in receiving this distinction; many lesser, more heavy-handed (and offensive) films were also banned during wartime.  However, one only has to look at two of the most popular films of all time to determine just how influential Triumph of the Will really is.  In George Lucas' Star Wars (Episode IV, for the newbies), the entire sequence in which the heroes are awarded their medals is ""appropriated"" from Triumph of the Will, even down to the replication of Albert Speer's ""Cathedral of Light"" which was created around the stadium at Nuremburg using huge flood lights.  Following that, Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy used Triumph of the Will as an obvious reference in the depiction of the mustering and marching of the Orc troops against the heroic defenders of Middle Earth.\nSo where does this leave us?  Is this film the virtual capture of evil on film?  Yes...and no.  It is a fact beyond dispute that the Third Reich epitomized evil during the mid-20th century, and any form of media which attempts to argue on its behalf is tainted by such an association.  However, it is unfair to penalize Leni Riefenstahl for doing exactly what she was directed to do.  What many people seem to be unable to accept is that she was willing to bring all of her cinematic acumen to bear upon such a project.  It is difficult to reconcile the director of Olympia with that of Triumph of the Will.  However, one must constantly remind oneself of Riefenstahl's commitment, as a documentarist, to capture the moment which is occurring before her cameras.  As such, she cannot be held accountable for the ultimate effect of Triumph of the Will; this is simply an example of a director doing a job a bit too well.  Still, no-one should simply sit back and view this film without the guidance of history.  To do so, to accept the arguments of the film's ""stars"" without question, would be to declare defeat in the face of an evil which should have been wiped from the face of the Earth decades ago.\nIn short, this film is an invaluable resource of technique.  Morally, it is beyond redemption.  This moral failing is not the fault of the director.";Problematic Genius
75;106.0;5.0;6.0;"Riefenstahl's documentary made for Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party to commemorate the 1934 Nurenburg rally: the official Nazi party convention. The documentary primarily covers the various parts of the rally including the opening and closing ceremonies.\n\n It's important to emphasize that this 'documentary' was a propaganda film designed to stir popular sentiment and political empathy for the infamous political party: it's not a documentary. True documentaries are informative in purpose and neutral in content: they don't seek to persuade an audience to take any particular point of view or action. Documentaries have limited editing and are typically chronological in sequence (e.g. a Jacques Cousteau film.) This film is propaganda: its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade an audience to accept a political ideology. All of the editing and composition of the film is geared solely towards that purpose: it was a rallying call for all Germans to join the party. The appearance of objectivity is arranged to persuade, not to objectively inform the audience.\n\n If one understands the socio-political climate of Germany in the late 1920s and early 1930s, one can clearly see what sentiments the film seeks to evoke and hence recognize its significance and brilliant execution. First of all, Nurenburg was one of the oldest towns in Germany and was strongly associated with German folklore and culture. The Nazi party chose this town as a convention point for that purpose: to emphasize its desire to promote a German renaissance that would touch upon all German 'volk'. Politically and economically, Germany was in a state of shambles because of the global economic depression. Many Germans feared an inevitable collapse to anarchy or Bolshevism. The opening scene starts with a Wagnerian piece and shows Hitler in a plane (he was the first head of state to use an airplane for political campaigns) peering down from high above the clouds as he arrives for the rally. The scene sought to reassure a worried public that The Fuhrer was omnipotent, omniscient, and was coming down from the heavens to save a troubled nation in a godlike fashion. When he arrives at the closing ceremony of the convention, Hitler is shown walking with his SS/SA escort out of the crowd and towards the podium instead from behind the podium to look down at the crowd; this was to instill the notion that Hitler wasn't just another Berlin bureaucrat from the old failed Weimar Republic coming to talk down to a broken people; it was done to evoke the sense that he was a man of the people for the peole: selflessly arising out of a worried crowd of fellow Germans to lead them to a better and safer future. Other scenes of happy German blonde and blue-eyed youths or common laborers performing paramilitary/social tasks were intended to evoke a proud sense of unity, purpose, and safety amongst all true German ""volk"" in these troubled times. Other scenes show speeches by Hitler and other NAZI functionaries telling party members how all Germans should unite for the Fatherland and not Godless Bolshevism; how youths should work to better their nation and learn endurance; etc., etc.\n\n The film can be watched in the original format or with an added commentary by a contemporary historian. The narrative adds a lot of information as to the intent of the film as well as the development of fascism in Germany. This film is important not only as a historical tool to understand the rise of Nazism and the dynamics of fascism, it is a very important landmark in the development of film, mass entertainment and mass communication in general. The mass communication techniques of Riefenstahl and Goebbels are still used today by virtually every modern government and media firm. In entertainment, Reifenstahl's filming techniques in camera work, scene arrangements, and editing, have been used by some of the greatest film makers such as George Lucas (the ceremonial procession at the end of Episode IV in particular), Stephen Spielberg, Ridley Scott, and Stanley Kubrick to name a few. I strongly believe that every person who seeks to better understand their world, political institutions, and mass media see this film at least once and study it.";An Influential Masterpiece of Cinematic Propaganda
76;107.0;5.0;6.0;Propaganda at its best.  Refenstahl would be proud that the inspit genre that she created is still alive and kicking today.  Just goes to show you that if you have a vision and and video camera, you can pervert the truth to your own end.;Micheal Moore's Favorite Movie?
119;108.0;5.0;7.0;I first saw Leni Riefenstahl's, Triumph of the Will, when I was a college freshman in a history of film course.  This version also included footage of the 1934 Olympics.  Though it was a well made piece of propaganda, it  was also the terrifying piece of film I've ever seen.  This had to do with  her presentaion to the public of how Adolf Hitler's charisma could draw you  in and hold your attention, even if you didn't understand a single word he  said.  This and this alone makes this piece of film a prelude to the most  horrifying piece of history the people of the 20th century will ever know.;A Film Most Terrifying
42;109.0;3.0;5.0;As a documentary about the NASDAP Party Congress of 1934, their parades and speeches, it is top notch.  As an example of pioneering techniques of film making it is superb.  However unless you like to watch endless images of Nazi Germans marching around holding flags what more is there to this DVD.\n\nThe speeches are even banal.  They are just regular speeches about how powerful they think they are, what history they are making, how nice they look in their uniforms.  Other than the Uniforms and Swastikas it is not unlike any political convention.  Most talk is about how loyal they are, how the leaders is the best leader, what great sacifices they are all making on behalf of the greater good for their people.\n\nI expected speeches about world domination, extermination, conquest and the like.  It is actually rather tame political theater.  The only thing I really took away from it was how serious they take themselves.  Even at a rally surrounded by like minded individuals in celebration of their victory they all seem rather constipated.\n\nWould have been so much better in color.;Much ado about nothing
107;110.0;5.0;6.0;"The first thing you will notice after Triumph of the Will is that there is no narration, only the sound of the speeches or the rallies, not all of them electrifying, some scenes just mundane marches through the altstadt. Hitler, of course, is strangely fascinating (there is no other word) and effete. It is said that he studied and mimicked the expressions of opera singers, the expressions of pain--he wanted you to feel his pain--and not triumph, which is why the title is so ironic. There  is also a strong homoerotic ambience, especially when Hitler exhorts a stadium of young men to ""hardness"" and struggle. There is not a far leap from the Wandervogel to the Hitler youth (consider also Albert Speer's love for Hitler). Erik Erikson, in an essay that was the first to use the now common notion of ""identity"" in its contemporary meaning, interpreted Hitler as a kind of leader of an adolescent gang in a society of paterfamilias. The Hitler of the ""Triumph of the Will"" is that gang leader.";Triumph of the Weak
109;111.0;5.0;6.0;"What could top Triumph Of The Will, the greatest propaganda film ever made?  Seeing in the ""Amazon"" listing that it ""stars""  Adolph Hitler!  Mel Brooks must be laughing out loud.";Starring Adolph Hitler?
64;112.0;3.0;5.0;"There is a lot of hype around Triumph of the Will, and the way you hear about it, you expect some kind of horror. Sure, Hitler's up to his usual screaming fits, but it's all relatively tame. The Nazi esthetic - like the shots of people from below and at an angle, to make them look brave and tall, or the abundant flags - really comes to the fore in this movie, but the content is relatively banal. If you've seen one parade of tens of thousands of bureaucrats or soldiers (in the Nazi party, the distinction was somewhat blurred), you've seen them all. There is a particularly bizarre part where fanatic-looking agricultural workers do a little theater for Hitler, which brings much levity, at least to the modern viewer. I imagine a German from the thirties would have found it stirring. AS for me, I amused myself every time Hess came to the screen by saying ""what, you're not gone yet ?"".";Way too much hype
83;113.0;4.0;5.0;"This is a fascinating film - a rare chance to see the Nazi Party through their eyes. Sometimes the film drags and is boring with such things as endless miles of parading Nazis and long-winded speeches, etc, but overall, this film will fascinate anyone interested in history.\nIn some ways I think these guys are brilliant and in other ways, I think they're just bizarre (the Nazi Party leaders). Their obsession with creating pseudo-traditionalism is just weird to me, I just don't ""get it"". To tear down old religeons and customs to fabricate new phony made-up ones just seems silly to me. These were some strange birds, no doubt, and this film exposes a lot of that strange mentality going-on behind the scenes in that party.\nIt's a good film and a great DVD with a wonderful commentary soundtrack, which makes watching this film like sitting through a home movie. The narrator explains what you are looking at wonderfully - this guy knows his stuff and unless you're an expert, you'll learn a lot watching this film with the commentary on. Get this DVD, its a great historical piece and I highly recommend it to everyone.";Great Look at the Nazis Through Their Own Eyes

91;115.0;5.0;5.0;"This DVD was recommended as the best version available for this film. It is. There is an extra film ""Day of Freedom"" included, along with the most complete film exposure available via the windowbox process. Sound is good. Everything is clear. You can see the pattern in the eagle over the Nuremburg rally well, and you can see the expressions on the peoples faces even. The filmwork of Leni Reifenstahl must be seen to be believed--awesome. Hitler and Hess are seen with hair misplaced and sweating, etc.--emphasizing their reality and humanness. The film is old, but it still hits you with hurricane force right in the gut. Wow. Don't miss this one. It is a historical gem.";Excellent quality
93;116.0;4.0;5.0;"I had to struggle to collect my thoughts after watching Leni Riefenstahl's infamous propaganda film.  What can one say about it?  Riefenstahl presents Hitler and the Nazi Party in a benign and glorified light and almost makes you want to be a part of it.  You find yourself being sucked into the images and crowds and cheering on the Nazis.  Then the film is finished and reality sets in.  Riefenstahl claims to this day that this is simply an art film, not a political or propaganda film.  But every shot of Triumph of the Will suggests a woman infatuated with her subject; Hitler and Nazism.\nThe shots of thousands of soldiers marching in unison is both stunning and terrifying.  The close-up shots of expressionless soldiers standing at attention are frightening and disturbing.  You think to yourself, 'nobody's home'.  Even more disturbing are shots of children standing in the streets waving, parents holding up their children so they can see the parade.  These children will be exposed to Nazi ideals, inducted into Hitler's youth, trained as soldiers, molded into racists, murderers, in other words into good little Nazis who will sacrifice themselves for their country.\nIronically, although this is considered to be a great propaganda film, the weakest parts are the scenes where Hitler gives his speeches.  No amount of camera work can disguise the fact that this man is insane.  He gives speaches about crushing the red menace and Germany's enemies.  He calls for peace while also calling for courage and loyalty to one's country.  He claims the German people are in favour with God and equates God with Nazism.  He claims that the Third Reich will last for a thousand years when in fact it will only last for twelve.  And this is after Riefenstahl has edited 115 minutes from a 2 hour speech.\nMany Germans and Austrians who lived through the Nazi era claim that they did not support Hitler, or that they were helpless to resist him, or that they did not know what the Nazis were up to.  But it's pretty clear from this film that most Germans DID support Hitler and that most supported him eagerly.  Riefenstahl herself claims to have been ignorant about what Hitler was up to.  If Hitler's favorite filmmaker did not know what Hitler was up to then who did?  One wonders how many present day Germans who seem like nice people have skeletons in their closets.";Germany's madness
100;117.0;4.0;5.0;"I purchased the VHS version of this incredible film. I saw it twice in the past. One time was in college, as part of the curricula was to show students in advertising some of the basic principles that can be applied to the present. However, I must ask this question.  Am I mistaken or has this film been edited? I seem to remember a different beginning: Hitler was standing alone at the doorway to the plane,looking out with a dreamlike visionary expression on his face. In addition, I seem to remember footage of that awesome rally at night with the beacons on either side of the audience (was it Nurenberg?), a greater amount of people in traditional German costumes and a display of the ""classic"" Aryan faces and bodies marching to the music. If I am not mistaken, it is a shame that these scenes were excluded, as it took away from my expectations of a more impressive version of the film. Is it ever possible to purchase an uncut version?";Captivating - but disappointed (?)
117;118.0;5.0;5.0;Triumph is most definately one of the few beautiful works of the world.

118;119.0;3.0;5.0;"The first time I saw this film, I felt the typical awe for its beautiful and hypnotic construction.  The Nazis, say what you will, had style to spare-- who can help but like those shiny boots and bouncy marches?  When  I watched it again, however, I was struck by the extreme vulgarity of the  Nazi movement-- there is a shot of ""Heil Hitler"" spell out in  lightbulbs.  The endless rows of Nazi banners with cheaply gilded metal  spelling out the names of regions, the people holding up paper to spell  ""Saar"" (a la football game), the soldiers carrying shovels  (! )-- it was cheap, silly spectacle.  Just what the great unwashed goes  for.  Hitler's speeches reveal his charisma, sure, but it's also clear that  he has nothing to say except ""The kids are good, Germany is great,  kudos to the Aryans!""  All this is accompanied by painfully  over-rehearsed gestures so crude that they'd be ridiculed by the coarsest  amatuer theatre company.  But they got style, glitzy and tacky though it  is. The two best shots make the whole thing worth while: early on, when you  see an indifferent cat pearched under a Nazi flag; and, during one of der  Fuhrer's speeches, when, as the crowd riotously applauds him, he gives a  little self-satisfied smirk.";Tacky Style
0;120.0;5.0;5.0;When I first saw Triumph of the Will in the late 80's, it struck me deeply both as a film student and as a Jew. I still struggle, as have many others, to understand how Germans were so utterly swept away by Nazi fervor. You  can read endless books trying to climb inside what seems like an alien  psychology from musty decades past, and then there is the electrifying  power imprisoned in Triumph of the Will. In an inverted way the film  reminds me of Raiders of the Lost Ark: an ancient relic that contains a  dormant, still-vital force. This one is reawakened by the simple act of  running it through a projector. To feel and not merely see that reflected  glory, even decades later in a different society, is Riefenstahl's genius.  Damn it, it IS beautiful. And terrible.;Beautiful, iconic, terrifying

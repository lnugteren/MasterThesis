3;1.0;5.0;6.0;Love this little machine.  For oral histories, it is ideal.  No voice recognition stops and starts with all the troubles these more modern machines possess.  Recording clarity is most exceptional for oral history and transcription is easy with such quality.  Glad I bought it!  I've already had owners of the more modern recorders ask to borrow my old-fashioned (but exceptional) cassette recorder.;Love this little machine
2;2.0;5.0;231.0;I would give this product a 5 simply for existing! I had a hard time finding a similar product in stores. When I would stumble onto one, the price was often ... more than what I could get it for here. I don't know if this review praises ... or the product more. Nevertheless, I'm very happy with it. Sure, it's a bit antiquated in this era of digital gimmickry. But for what I need it for, it works great. Easy to use controls, big speaker for playback and it doesn't eat tapes! What more do you want?;Thank goodness this exists!
20;3.0;5.0;110.0;A genuine throw back to the 1970's, the RQ-2102 is a quality portable recorder. Using 4 D cells or AC, this is a heavy unit by today's standards. Features old fashion slide in or out plastic carrying handle. If you need a rugged unit that will be used on a table and need to do a lot of recording or playback this would be a better choice than Panasonic's mini cassette recorder such as the RQ-L31 which is also an excellent cassette recorder. Unlike the mini cassette recorders this model will fast forward and rewind faster. The buttons feel solid so when you push you get a good response. Has an excellent pause control by releasing the capstan and pinch roller from the cassette removing that awful low whine found in mini cassette recorders. Has que, review and tape counter and can use external microphone or earphones. Larger speaker provide better and fuller sound. This is the last and best of Panasonic's shoe  box style units so if you like this 1970's style recorder get this and you won't be disappointed.;Quality Old School Cassette Recorder
31;4.0;5.0;78.0;"I purchased this tape recorder/player for my father, who is legally blind but still likes to lecture on various gardening topics for local clubs.  He wanted a way to record his lectures as well as a back-up tape player in case the one provided by the Association for the Blind has a problem.  Therefore the buttons have to be large and easy to mark in a unique way and the operation has to be simple.  I have always liked Panasonic and I was not disappointed this time, either.  The player works perfectly and the built-in microphone picked up the music I was playing from another audio-tape player with surprising accuracy, as well as my voice.  The buttons come with raised emblems which will help my father to find the one he wants.  The recorder runs efficiently on 4 size ""C"" batteries, as well as plugging into the wall, and has ports for headphones and a hand-held microphone (not included with this unit). Best of all from my point of view, it looks and feels like my favorite old tape recorder from the 1970's.  I didn't get to handle it for very long because it was a gift, but I really like it.";Old-fashioned Quality
36;5.0;5.0;64.0;i bought this to read my little girls bedtime stories aloud and record them for when we aren't home. we've also had their grandparents from out of town read their favorite books onto tape. it works GREAT for this purpose...and the kids love playing with it too, in between. very sturdy.;works great

34;7.0;5.0;40.0;Performs as advertised.  Sturdy, excellent value for the price.  I use it in an automobile that does not have a cassette player built in.  It operates perfectly, and has a large enough speaker to sound fine.  I listen to the spoken word, not for music.  Powered from a small inverter, it works perfectly.;Panasonic RQ2102 Shoe Box Recorder
35;8.0;5.0;40.0;This is a great tape recorder for recording live music on a very low bufget.  The mic picks up everything loud and clear. I love to use it when I cannot access my 4 track tape recorder, or just for more informal recording.  A classic.;I love this machine
29;9.0;1.0;34.0;The recorder worked ok but seemed to be made very cheaply, with a great deal of plastic. After having it for a year in which I used it, but not a lot, it now makes a clicking sound when it plays. I'm sure it won't last much longer. I would rather pay more and have an item work. I can not recommend this because of how quickly it has started to deteriorate.;Problems after a year

0;11.0;2.0;38.0;I bought this tape recorder after I read a good review here. If the review was truethful, I must have gotten one from a bad production batch.  With the volume set at the mid-range, I could hardly reproduce any audible sound. The volume has to be at maximum before I could hear discernible voices without putting my ear right above the speaker. It also records a lot of anoying background noise.  I had bought recently an Aiwa micro-cassette tape recorder which turned out to be nearly useless.  I was hoping this one, using a full size cassette and with a large speaker, would not have the problem of smaller one.  But that was not the case.;A big disappointment
39;12.0;1.0;32.0;"I doubt that they are all this bad.  Maybe I just got ""lucky"".  The first time I put the tape in, the motor could hardly pull the tape.  When I tried to record, it played back all shaky, like a playing a record off-center on a turntable.  I returned it.";horrible
38;13.0;5.0;28.0;this is as good as the tape recorders they sell for over 50 dollars at radioshack and its only 20 i use it to record my rock band and it sounds almost as good as the 150 dollar tascam portastudios it doesnt eat tapes it has 1 button recording and i don't see were the other reviewer said he could barely hear it on playback he musta had a defected 1 cause the playbacks very loud and clear im very happy with this item i record my entire band on it every instrument can be heard clearly and the playbacks loud without static it even comes with the ac adapter and a handle to carry it this is a steal i might buy another at this price;garage bands buy this
27;14.0;1.0;21.0;We ordered this to play cassettes for an educational program.  We were able to open it to play one of the tapes, but we were not able to eject the tape.  The door will not open and we cannot get the tape out.  Because of the proprietary nature of the tape, we cannot return the player until we get the tape out of the player.;Tape doesn't eject from player
5;15.0;5.0;9.0;"I don't write many reviews, but I felt compelled to write this one.  First off, kudos to the vendor who is still selling this ""retro"" product.  I know we have hi-tech digital recorders and what not. I own and use them too.  I went back to school for a doctorate and record all of my lectures on a smaller tape recorder I bought from Radio Shack years ago. It's a workhorse and I'm afraid it will someday kick the bucket.\n\nSo, I purchased this shoe box tape recorder which I got yesterday.  I connected the AC cord to it and played one of my lectures.  If you have the volume very low, you may get that ""tinny"" sound another reviewer mentioned about this product.  But, if you increase the volume, it sounds fine.  The 3 inch speaker makes a difference and it sounds just a close as you can get to being inside the classroom.  The pause button allows me to stop the tape a critical points in the lecture to jot down important notes.  Headphones work fine (for those people that keep asking, they are not included, and neither are the batteries).\n\nMy generation (i.e. Generation X) ushered in the internet in the early to mid-1990s. Why am I using tape recorders?  Well, I guess it's a habit.  I used it in graduate school in the late 90s to mid-2000s.  I trust the old media.  To me, cassette tapes are somehow more ""permanent.""  Thus, the tape counter is a very important feature for me.  I can take any tape and listen to any part of a lecture with the tape counter.  I'm sure this can be done with the digital recorders but I have yet to learn how.\n\nI think it's important to note that I use the Maxell UR-90 (minutes - 45 minutes each side) blank audio cassette tapes for voice recording (Position Type A).  You can get longer tapes, but that actual tape gets thinner and therefore more susceptible for getting ""eaten"" by your tape player.  I believe you get the best quality sound with the Maxell UR-90.\n\nLastly, you can convert the lecture to MP3s and save them on a CD or cloud - whatever suits you.  You just need a connecter cord from your tape player to your digital recorder.  The digital recorder I'm using is the Sony ICD-AX412 Digital Flash Memory Voice recorder that I purchased here on Amazon.  It's phenomenal! I record my own lectures.  I haven't written a review for it because there are plenty of positive reviews for this digital recorder.  I  connected my old Radio Shack tape recorder to it and converted a taped lecture to an MP3.\n\nOverall, I thought this product deserves 5 stars for availability, reliability, good construction, sound quality (even though when the volume is very low you may get the tinny sound - but just increase the volume and it goes away), tape counter, pause button.  Note: I use the product for listening to lectures recorded from the internet.";"I love ""Retro"""
1;16.0;1.0;23.0;I was disappointed with this product because it didn't has the jack holes that my old recorder had but since I discarded the box I didn't send it back for credit.;No holes for jacks
7;17.0;4.0;9.0;In fall 2012 I ordered one of this product, and a couple weeks later ordered another one as a spare. This recorder produces a fuller more detailed, natural sound than the smaller Sony cassette recorder. It operates on either battery or AC, but for some reason the sound is a little better on battery. Batteries last a fairly long time--longer than for the Sony. I bought the good-quality but inexpensive Pyle-Pro PDMIC58 Professional Moving Coil Dynamic Handheld Microphone (Amazon), which works well with it, but you need to get the adapter plug also, separately (Amazon has it). As another review pointed out, the only disappointing thing is that playback through headphones is on one channel only--if I want to hear it in both ears, I need to take the cassette out and play it back through the smaller Sony recorder, which does a good job for this purpose, although the actual recording process is better through the Panasonic, as is playback through the units' own speaker.\n\nUsing the first Panasonic I ordered I noticed when I fast forward or reverse by holding the button down it makes a loud high-speed sound through the speaker, which I usually tried to muffle by putting my hand over it. Recently the unit failed to record more and more often after pressing the record button--the tape would move forward but no sound would be recorded, to the point that it did this all the time. I pulled out my spare and to my surprise it did not make the loud noise when fast forwarding or reversing the tape while holding down the button, sparing my ears. This leads me to believe that the first unit was defective in that respect--the mechanism was out of alignment or something which led to it ultimately not recording either. So far the second unit has no problems and I've ordered a third unit as my new spare.\n\nBy the way, for immediate self-contained playback, compared to a good quality stereo digital recorder for several hundred dollars, which requires playback through a computer and speaker system for anything but tiny tinny sound, the Panasonic cassette player gives a louder, fuller, more natural sound and allows immediate playback. (I have to check whether headphones can be plugged directly into those little digital recorders because I didn't have headphones when first investigating them.--headphones plugged in work fine with the Zoom recorders, at least the Zoom Handy H2 recorder);Basic natural analog playback sound with sufficient volume
4;18.0;5.0;5.0;Very classical recorder and player.  I have not gotten the chance to use this much yet, but it comes in handy with cassettes as I have plenty of cassette players at home.  It is portable so I could leave it on the Piano and record myself easily.  It's great for self-recording and since cassette tapes are very portable and personal, it can be carried easily or sent anywhere safely.\n\nThe technology is old but I find there's a lot of use for it.  Just the easiness in recording and basic hardware is simple for me to record easily.  Great product, and great ease to record and play cassette tapes.;It is portable so I could leave it on the Piano and record myself easily. It's great for self-recording and since cassette tapes
16;19.0;5.0;13.0;Sometimes the old tech is the best.  If you need to record complex choral rehearsals lasting an hour and a half, or two hours, including repetitions of various tricky phrases, and solo, duet, and complex passages, this panasonic shoebox recorder will record these and the entire session on traditional cassette tapes, easy to plug into a wall socket (better than batteries which can run out if a session is too long)  and super easy to operate: two buttons push down together and you are recording.  Rewind: one button.  Playback: another button.  Cassettes are inexpensive and can be recorded over.  Vocal music comes out in great quality, true sound. The shoebox design is compact, sturdy.  My kids earlier bought me a new, modern digital recorder.  It didn't have the capacity to record an entire rehearsal and the replay sounded like Minnie Mouse singing to Mickey.  Went on line at a Best Buy employee's suggestion and found the shoebox recorder, like one of the old ones, but brand new and super for the job.  Acoustic quality is great.  Shipment was prompt.  All prices were super reasonable!  Music majors take note!!;recording rehearsals, vocal chorus

6;22.0;1.0;6.0;The buttons on this recorder stick and are hard to use.  I cannot record on it without trying to push record and play several times to get them to stay down.  Forget about trying to pause while recording, it simply won't do it.  It quite frankly is a piece of cheap garbage.;I hate it!
37;23.0;1.0;14.0;I got this tape recorder and plugged it in, but the tape heads wouldn't even turn. It made some sort of noise and that was the end of that. I had to return it for a refund.

25;24.0;4.0;11.0;I purchased the Panasonic Shoe Box recorder for my wife.  She plays the organ and likes to listen to her pratice sessions for improvement.  At first the sound quality wasn't good enough but I bought a external mic at Radio Shack for $10.00 and now the sound is very good, a big improvement.  I purchased a Universal Cassette Mic # 3303019 from my local Radio Shack.\n\nBest of all, she likes it!!!;Good Recorder for the price
33;25.0;4.0;12.0;I like this little tape recorder. I use it for listening to books on tape while I work. The only thing I don't like about it is that it wasn't loud enough to hear over my industrial sewing machine,but with small speakers that I already had it's fine. That probably wouldn't be an issue for most people. I liked the price(under $25.)and how fast I recieved it. I'm sure I'll be using it for many years.;tape player
32;26.0;2.0;11.0;"I'm someone who just wants an easy-to-use recorder to conduct interviews, phone interviews, the latter purpose for which I have an adapter.  Fine.  I bought this recorder in July 2006.  I've done somewhere between 15 to 20 hours of recording total on it.  Other use includes playback and cueing the rewind - the usual.  Well, here it is, March, 2007, and it ate a brand new tape right in the middle of an interview.  The heads are clean; the tape was new (and the rest of the tapes in the batch are fine, so I don't think it was the tape).  What I think, ultimately, is that this is a cheap recorder made in China where (judging from the other reviews and my own experience) is good....when it works.

23;28.0;1.0;9.0;I purchased first time and last two Panasonic RQ2102 Shoe Box Recorder for my niece Renee children.  The package arrived and they are nice players.  I noticed that there were no AC Adapters enclosed.  Had to call information for toll free number to Restockit it was not on the statement.  Restockit information told me the item did not come with a AC Adapter but the unit has a female socket for it.\n\nNot satified I called Amazon and they said it was a third party seller and couldn't help me.

17;32.0;3.0;6.0;Either no erase head or it doesn't work.\nOf course, if I WANT to add parts to a recording, perhaps that might be good, if I was able to figure out the precise timing.\n\nThere was virtually NO STATIC in the recording and great volume in the playback, so in that regard it is much superior to some other cassette recorders I have. I am resigned to perhaps check if I can erase via the other recorders enough so that this one can then re-record on some of those tapes later ...\n\nAnother flaw is the buttons are very quirky or flimsy -- they tend to look like they are sticking in the down position.\n\nI am glad that it does NOT auto-reverse, because that on other recorders has destroyed some tapes by accident .\n\nThe low cost meant to me that it wasn't worth the hassle to return it even if I didn't want it.

7;1.0;3.0;5.0;Unlike Lexar or Sandisk, Viking does not design or make the components that go into their flash memory cards, instead they use off-the-shelf components (controller and memory core) made by others.  This means two things: 1) lower cost (to Viking), and 2) compatibility with devices may not be as robust as Lexar or Sandisk.  There have been numerous reports about incompatibility between Viking flash memory and various digital cameras and PDAs.  You should do a web search before buying this product.\n\nThat said, this Viking CF card should work in most digital cameras or older Pocket PCs that take CF.  The rated speed of 8x means this is not suitable for digital SLR's such as the Nikon D70 or Canon EOS Digital Rebel which need higher-speed CF cards (40x or higher).  Most consumer, non-SLR digital cameras will find the speed of this card more than adequate.  128MB holds about 80-100 5MP, high-quality pictures (depending on the complexity of each picture and the particular camera model).  I personally recommend if you have a 4MP or more camera, you should have a 256MB memory card as your primary card, while carrying a 128MB card like this Viking as a spare.\n\nIn short, this Viking 128MB CF card is good for the money.  Just make sure it's compatible with your digital camera.;Good value, but watch out for compatibility
6;2.0;5.0;120.0;If you've had a 2 mega-pixel or above camera for more than a few days then you've realized that an 8 or 16 mb memory card is not going to cut it. In my opinion, you really have two good alternatives. (1) a good capacity compactflash memory card like this Viking card, or (2) one of the microdrives.\nThis 128 mb Viking memory card is a good value on a cost per megabyte basis (I have not seen a better compactflash value anywhere), and it offers more peace of mind since it has no moving parts. However, the microdrive does cost less per megabyte (in fact, for the same cost you'll get 340 mb of storage vs. 128 mb with the Viking), although you'll have a miniature hard drive to worry about in terms of potential lost photos.\nI've got both, but I'll only use the microdrive on long trips where I know I'll need the storage space. And then I'mn exceptionally careful with it. Most people will be happier going the compactflash route, in which case this Viking card is the best value and very reliable. I'm very pleased with it. Go ahead, it's pretty much an essential accessory.;Buy this or a microdrive
4;3.0;5.0;66.0;I've not seen a cheaper price, and I've been looking in stores.  This is a good value.\nKeep in mind, though, unlike the cheaper versions of this card, this card does NOT come with a flash reader.  I was disappointed to find this out, but it was my own fault for just assuming it did.  I still give it 5 stars.\n[A note to HP Jornada 548 customers.  This card works fine with the Jornada Pocket PC.  I say this because it is not mentioned in the advertisement that the 128MB version is compatible, but it is.]\nOne nice thing about this card is that there is 24/7 tech support available if something should go wrong with it (or with installation or whatever), but I don't know what could really go wrong with it --I guess that's why they offer the tech support!\nAnyone using MP3s should REALLY go for this card and skip the 64 MB card.  The 64 MB card would be rather skimpy, and with 128 MB you'll ALWAYS find things to store on it.  (I've had my card three days now and I've filled up 50 MB already, downloading songs, books, and maps).\nOne nice thing about having a flash card for a PocketPC (or other handheld) is that you can back up your entire regular memory onto your flashcard easily, without having to worry about memory failure.  That is pretty neat, kind of like a second hard drive for your computer...;A VERY good value! Don't bother with a smaller card for MP3s
2;4.0;5.0;57.0;Great price on a great flash card. I needed ONE more flash card so I could stop juggling the flash cards I already have between devices every few days... (Kodak DC4800 camera, HP Handheld computer, DC50, etc.)\nEspecially when traveling, I take LOTS of pictures and adding this card to my electronics arsenal means I can snap longer before downloading onto my 6-gigabyte digital wallet storage device.  Shooting highest-resolution pics is less trouble with this high-capacity card when compared to smaller-capacity ones since this card doesn't fill-up so quickly. And storing files (images, audio, documents, etc.) for my handheld computer is easier and more fun, too.\nAnd this card is NOT SLOWER than others I have. My devices seem to read/write to this card at the same speed as my other CF cards.;SUPERB value
3;5.0;5.0;57.0;I now have three Compact Flash card, including this one.  An 8-meg card made by SanDisk came with my camera.  I also have a 64-meg Kingston card.  I can safely say that the Viking card is as good as either of the other two as far as quality and speed are concerned.\nI use this card in a 2 Megapixel Canon S10 digital camera.  I like to shoot at the highest resolution and medium compression.  With my 64 meg card, this gave me about 105 pictures.  With an upcomping vacation to Florida that I planned on being photographed totally digital, I realized that I would need additional storage.  I considered the IBM Mocrodrive, but I ruled it out for several reasons.  I wanted about 128 megs of storage and this card's price was the best I found.  Adding a coupon made the price even more attractive.\nWith this card, I can store 212 2-megapixel pictures.  With my additional storage, I will be able to take more than 300 photos.  Each night I will be able to delete the pictures that I do not want.  I will come home with 300 keepers.\nThis card can't be beat for price per megabyte.  I shopped around for a while, but I always came back to this Viking card and ended up pulling the trigger.  This is a great card.;A great card.
49;6.0;5.0;36.0;I bought this for my Kodak DC4800 3.1 megapixel camera.  The high-resolution images are memory hogs, so I bought this card to augment the 16 MB card that came with it.  The card works just as well as my kodak card--no noticeable performance differences whatsoever.  AND, this card costs WAY less than similar offering directly from Kodak or other providers.  I love Kodak, but not enough to spend twice as much money for their product!\nOh, and Amazon.com has the best price for this that I have seen.;Excellent Value
8;7.0;3.0;7.0;"So far, the only way I have been able to obtain my rebate is to pester the rebate company for months until they finally decide I am not going to give up until I get my rebate. Not worht it. The company uses a web site called ""wheresmyrebate"" com. Do not trust them. Other than that, the card is excelent and I recomend the card, just not the company policies.";You May Not See Your Rebate
19;8.0;5.0;19.0;"I'm a happy owner of Nikon's new addition in the advanced amateur/professional Digital Camera market - the D100. The camera received tremendous pre-release publicity and I can say from first hand knowledge that the praise is justified. However the D100 doesn't arrive with any means of image storage. So I ran down to the closest electronics store and purchaged a 128 MB CF Memory card for about ($). The card was rated as ""4X"" speed. It worked great with no complaints. However last week I searched Amazon.com and found a very high quality Viking 128 MB Compact Flash card at ($) and free shipping! The Viking is a much higher quality card that the one previously purchased and ($) less money and no shipping cost! A real bargain in my book! Are you an eBay shopper? Then you know that the Viking card is selling for more on eBay than Amazon's price!";128 MB Viking Compact Flash Card and the Nikon D100
0;9.0;5.0;20.0;I'm using a Canon S100 which came with the 8MB card. Obviously not enough. I upgraded to a SanDisk 64 MB card which was great. I'm still using it, and was able to take about 115 pics with the card. I needed (wanted) the ability to take more pics without downloading my pics to my PC, and this card was a great deal for the size.\nUsed it for the first time this past weekend. And I didn't notice any speed difference between the 64 MB card and the 128 MB. Wass able to take pics of anything without worrying about filling up the card. I actually didn't even fill up the card (took 160 pics). If you have the money, definitely get it - its just mighty convenient.;More Memory, More Pics ... Stress Free
1;10.0;5.0;20.0;"Turned 548 off, pluged 128M Viking in, turned unit back on.  That's all there was to it.\nUsed Sync Explore in the computer to move items already in 548 memory to the 128M Viking CF memory.  Just dragged ""my documents"" in total over and it copied directory and all subdirectories and files without further assistance.\nWorks for me <grin>.\nSuppose I'll buy a Viking gig in a few years when the price comes down.";Works great in the Jonada 548
45;11.0;5.0;19.0;I have a Canon PowerShot S100, which came with an 8MB card that could store a measly 16 photos at the default resolution.  This card can store 220+!  I'm fairly new to this tecnology and figured that the bigger the card, the slower it would be to shoot, browse, format, etc.  The card formatted in a flash (pardon the pun), and it just whizzes along when I take pictures.  Forget all the other cards and sizes.  Go for the gusto and get the full 128 MB!;Gotta Have It, 'Nuff Said
47;12.0;5.0;18.0;I got this flashcard primarily so that I could take largeamounts of pictures while on trips.  I was debating between a 64MB andthis 128MB ...  boy am I glad I got this one!  I have a Kodak DC3400and on the high resolution and good quality settings you can getapproximately 309 photos on this card and that camera.  The real fieldtest came when I went to Maui and went wild taking photos of sceneryto my heart's content.  Four days of shooting pictures and I still had97 more I could have taken!  Lot's of capacity.  You will not bedissappointed in this investment ... ...  It was a good deal then andit is an even better value now.  Go with it!  The best thing is thatyou will have comfort in knowing that you have the capacity to takethe pictures when you need to (you'll not miss out on those preciousmoments that will never repeat themselves).  END;The ultimate value!
17;13.0;4.0;13.0;I bought this card because the camera manufacturers are pretty darn chincy at furnishing a reasonably sized CF card.....knowing what they furnish will only hold a few pics.  I bought this card because it ranks amount the top three cards or so as far as write and read speed.  This has proved to be true.  I use it in my Kodak and Minolta cameras and also my Epson 785 printer.  Don't be afraid to buy this.....I already did all the leg work.  Also, I think probably this is one item that Amazon is least expensive on......so you are getting good value.;Viking CF Card
23;14.0;5.0;12.0;- I use it with > 3 MP Canon S30 and it gives me 76 pictures.\n- It works reliably and I have not seen any issues with both my cards.\n- With the 256 MB card I know I will run out of battery before I fill the CF card...so, I see the 128 MB as the optimum card size.;The perfect solution for your 3 MP camera
26;15.0;5.0;12.0;The Viking 128M CF is my favorite memory card.  I use them with my Minolta Dimage 7 which is a 5 meg camera.  At the highest resolution, I get 49 images, and at the next lowest resolution (1600x1200), which is still perfect for Ofoto, I get 120 images.  I have seven of them, so I get anywhere from 343 to 840 shots each day, depending on resolution.  If you ever put an empty card in your camera and it shows less than the expected images, try using the camera to format the card.  I put an empty card in and it showed space for only 28 instead of 49 images.  I checked and there were no images on the card.  I thought it might be broken.  I formatted the card inside the camera and bang, 49 images.;My Favorite CF!
16;16.0;5.0;11.0;It was suggested for the camera I purchased (Kodak EasyShare DX4900), and they had a discount.  It works fine, and it has a picture of a viking on it.  It holds about 110 pictures.;It's a memory card - what more do you want?
18;17.0;5.0;11.0;I just recently purchased a Canon digital camera and I bought this at the same time. I can take so many pictures with my new camera! If I would not have purchased this, I would have been disappointed with the fact that I can only take 15 pictures with my 8 MB card. With this card on the best resolution, I can take 250 pictures! You definitely need something like this if you really want to take advantage of your digital camera.;A must have!
20;18.0;5.0;11.0;This is a great card.  I bought this with my S200 Elph because I knew the included 8meg card wouldn't be large enough.  It's transfer speed does talk a second or two, but its not long enough to make me irratated.  Also, the two sides of the card are very different, so I can tell which side goes up.  The card also looks very cool, very shiny.  Before you buy this one, however, make sure that its the kind of card your camera/MP3 player/etc. takes, so you don't end up like the reviewer who said your MP3 player would need to be the size of a boombox to use this card.  Another plus is that this is the cheapest 128meg card I have seen on Amazon.com.  For a great value for a 128meg card, definately buy this one.;Great Card
35;19.0;4.0;12.0;The 128 meg card by Viking provides the perfect balance of affordability and space. This card allows me to shoot over 400 1024x768 shots with my Canon Elph S110. (...);plenty of storage
13;20.0;5.0;9.0;"I have a 2 megapixel canon elph and own two other CF cards, (Sandisk 64mb and Fuji64mb) Reason I got another CF card was the price as of Feb 2003, was the lowest I've seen ever, and I did abit more research than before. check dpreview.com they have a section of CF card ratings and this particular card did very good, as far as speed and reliability.\nI did my own amateur testing and noticed ""slight"" differences, the Viking and Sandisk cards were abit faster in taking multiple shots. (but this is a matter of miliseconds) reliability, I have had the two other cards for about 6 months and have not had a problem with data loss of any kind. On my 2 megapixel camera, the Viking 128mb CF card shot about 360-400 images ""high quality"" (depending on image size, each image can be a different file size, depending on the information each one requires)\nSo, I would just stick with a big name like Viking or Sandisk and you really cant go wrong.";good solid card/brand
11;21.0;3.0;7.0;I was really happy with the Viking CF cards till I got a Lexar. It is noticabilly faster. With the Cannon that matters cause the shutter is already kinda slow. I recomend you check out the Lexar.;SLOW NOW
39;22.0;5.0;10.0;I bought this product for the elph s300 and could not be happier. The card works seemlesly and stores about 125 pictures at maximum 2.1 megapixel resolution. The cost can't be beat,... A nice addition if you have a laptop is a PCMCIA Viking adapter which allows you to plug the compact flash card directly into the computer and use it as a drive. This setup is much faster than any USB download or compactflash card reader and is ideal for digital images.;Excellent value.
9;23.0;1.0;5.0;I would avoid this compact flash card--  I've gone thru two, both which proved to be defective.;defective card after another
46;24.0;5.0;10.0;with this memory card I can store hours of music tons of pictures and even full episodes of my favorite shows this is a great card but if you can I recomend you get IBM's 1GB microdrive with one gig you an store a few hours of high quality video.  In conclusion this is a great card but the bigger the better.;Card works great with my ipaq
21;25.0;5.0;8.0;128 mb gives me over 500 pictures in my digital camera.\nit's a very fast card and great value for the money.\nnot having to worry about memory is a great feeling.\nMy whole honeymoon on one card! well done, Viking!;lotsa power in a little package!
10;26.0;5.0;5.0;I recently purchased a Nikon Coolpix 2100 and bought this card for extra storage.  At the 2 MP high setting, this card holds about 130 pictures.  At the next lowest setting, it holds well over 250.  For me, this is PLENTY of storage.  Some people mentioned compatibility issues with the Coolpix, but this was not the case for me.  You just need to make sure you format the card in the camera before its first use.  Overall I think Viking makes a product which, for the price, is the best value on the market.  Buy this card, you won't be disappointed.;Meets my needs
14;27.0;5.0;7.0;I bought this card for a Nikon Coolpix 2500.  I had heard that some cards work great in some cameras and not so great in others.  When I installed the card the Nikon Coolpix logo appeared and just stayed and looked at me!  I was dismayed, but all of a sudden the screen went blank and the logo appeared again.  Then, the screen came alive and I formated the card.  From that time on it worked perfectly and is very fast.  I guess the camera or the card had to get used to each other.  All in all, a Great Card.;Great Card
29;28.0;5.0;8.0;Makes the new digital camera (a Canon Powershot A20) fully functional. Set at small resolution/super-fine definition, this card gives me 577 photos!\nFunctions smoothly with both camera and card reader.\nA great deal for the price!;Does exactly what it says it will do!
24;29.0;5.0;7.0;This is a great product for a great price!  I started with a camera that had only 8MB of space.  That equated to less than 10 pictures.  This card set me up with almost 200 pictures!  More than enough!  This is a great buy!;Amazing value!
15;30.0;5.0;6.0;Beautiful piece of memory - works fast, reliably (atleast since the past 1 month) and no worries at all - for the comparatively low price of 128 MB as against 64 MB - I think it is a must have for Digital cameras/MP3 players !...;Viking 128 MB compact flash card review
48;31.0;5.0;8.0;I searched a really long time for a good solution for my Canon Powershot G1.  It takes microdrive, but when I asked around, I heard that they had some reliability problems.  So I went with the largest memory I could buy.  The camera itself came with 16Mb, and I have another 48Mb in cards from a previous digital - so altogether I can take over a thousand pictures at very high resolution.  Now I need a Digital Wallet for those long trips without a laptop - perfect combo.;Hundreds of pictures - in a single card
32;32.0;2.0;7.0;I purchased this item to use with my Nikon 775.  I checked with the Viking Configurator which indicated there was no problem.  When I attempted to use the card, however, my camera warned the card could not be used.  The card works fine in my older HP C30.  I gave the item 2 stars instead of 1 because the card worked in my older camera.  I sent an e-mail to Viking but got no response.  By the way, Amazon's policy on returns is a restocking fee if the package is opened.  How are you going to find out something does not work unless you open the package and try it?  Buyer beware!!!!;Viking CF128M Incompatible with Nikon 775
36;33.0;5.0;7.0;I have 2 of these.  They work well in both IPAQs and Canon digital cameras.;Great Deal
22;34.0;5.0;6.0;It holds lots. Not much more to say about it really. Please vote this as a useful review.;Love it
12;35.0;4.0;5.0;Most digital cameras include an 8Mb CF card which is definitely not adequate, you can only get about 8-11 pictures at 1600x1200 with medium compression.  On a 128 Mb card, you can fit over 200 pictures!  Now you can go on vacation without a laptop and not run out of digital film.  If your camera does slideshows and hooks up to a TV, you're all set for family show and tell.\nThis card, including the rebate, is the best value for a 128 Mb card.  I did not notice any differences between this card and my Kodak CF card in terms of speed of transfers, previewing pictures on the camera, or reading from a card reader.  If anything, it seems faster than the Kodak CF card, but this is just an impression as I did not time it with a stopwatch.\nAs noted, the rebate period is ridiculously short as you must submit within 15 days of the purchase date.;Works great, snappy transfers, watch out for rebate deadline
42;36.0;5.0;7.0;I chose this card for my Canon S300 because it was the cheapest available 128mb compact flash card. This card is not only cheap, but also a very good deal! You can save up to 128 pictures in ultra high quality (1600*1200 resolution). This is over ten times more than the memory that was shipped with the S300! I think that you can only have fun with a digital camera if you have enough memory! And the best is, that I experienced zero problems with this tiny card. Just put it into your camera and take pictures!;128mb - more than you think!
43;37.0;5.0;7.0;"Functions as expected when compared to my Sandisk 128 MB CF card. Both the Sandisk and Viking CF cards display 81 ""fine"" photos after formatting/deleting CF card.\nThe transfer rate of the Sandisk and Viking is comparable on my Sandisk USB reader. The bottle neck could be with the USB reader. Though, both the Sandisk and Viking CF cards also require approximatly the same time to save photos or save 8 MB Quicktime movies.";Works with my Nikon990 and Sandisk USB reader
27;38.0;5.0;6.0;Viking makes great memory cards at a very competitive price. In the technical and performance testing reviews that I have read, they are in the top three for quality and speed, at the lowest cost. The 128MB card allows my Epson 3100Z camera to take 256 pictures at the next to highest setting, which equals 5x7-35mm quality prints in my opinion. I bought two cards for extended trips and holidays, figuring that the equivalent of 40 rolls of film would be adequate for any possible camera bug. It did take five months to receive my rebate that was being offered by Viking at the time. I would have bought the cards without the rebate, and had almost given up on receiving a rebate. This did make the cards even more of a bargain.;Great Memory
30;39.0;5.0;6.0;I purchased this card about 6 months ago, and I have just loved it.  I use this card in my IPAQ 3635 and my Kodak digital Camera DC265, and it works flawlessly with both.  I also purchased the Viking Compact Flash reader for high-speed data transfer to my PC, and that really helps out when I'm in a hurry.  Every digital camera or other IPAQ I put this card in it works great, I highly recommend this product. And at this price it can't be beat!;This little guy works like a charm
5;40.0;5.0;7.0;The 8mb memory that came with my 1 megapixel Kodak DC240 justdidn't cut the mustard. When I saw the Viking 128mb memory ..., I jumped at the chance. Now all I need is a battery charger that accommodates European outlets, and I'm all set for my European vacations. Think of it: No more film processing charges!;A Great Memory at a Great Price

Having the extra memory afforded by this little card meant that I could relax and not worry about running out of space for all my photos.\nTransferring the photos to my laptop was a piece of cake, and took very little time -- partially a function of the card.\nI highly recommend this as the *first* accessory/upgrade you purchase for your camera!";Great addition for your digital camera

31;45.0;5.0;5.0;The Viking 128 MB compact flash card is a tremedous value. At approximately $.50 per megabyte, it doesn't get much lower than this. I have an Olympus E-10 4 megapixel camera, and at the resolution I normally shoot at(super quality), I can store about 45 images on this card. For photos I use on the web, this card will handle over 400 images!  I'm going to purchase another card for my son, who just got an Mp3 player for Christmas. With this card installed, he'll be able to store about 3 hours of music.\nI have other Viking cards, and have never had a problem with any of them.  My only regret is that my camera apparently doesn't support a card larger than 128 megabytes.;Compact Flash Card
34;46.0;5.0;5.0;The Viking 128MB is cheap and works like it should -- I've had no problems at all.  I can take up to 300 pictures on one card with my Nikon Coolpix 995 but usually use higher resolution and get 150 pictures.  I have two cards and they last for even long vacations (plus, you can use the National Geographic approach when using this card -- take 300 pictures to get 30 good ones!).\nAlso, the rebate (when it was offered) worked just fine for me.;Works great with Nikon Coolpix
37;47.0;5.0;5.0;An excellent CF card.  Its is very fast at reading and writing data (a weakness in some CF cards) and it is very reliable.  I have yet to have one single problem with this card.  I doubt I will buy any other brand of CF card.  Viking has done a great job.;High quality and affordable.
38;48.0;5.0;5.0;Absolutely fantastic memory expansion for the Kodak DC290 digital camera!  My DC290 came with 16-Megs an at the lowest resolution setting (about 140K size files) I could only take 71-pictures.  I plugged the Viking 128-Meg flash card in a suddenly, I have over 610 picture files available --- definitely will need another set of batteries.  Even at the highest, uncompressed setting, 30-picture files are available.  With the USB connection, downloading takes very little time.  To sum it up, great value for the price!  Keep on clicking!;Makes the Kodak DC290 Digital Camera Explode!
41;49.0;4.0;5.0;The Viking 128 MB card represents an excellent value today as Compact Flash prices finally begin to come down a bit. I use the $1/per MB rule as a basis for what represents a good value at today's prices (June 2001). ..., the Viking card comes in well below that figure and I know of no card by Viking or any other manufacturer with a lower dollar per MB price.\nHaving said that, the only complaint is the Viking card does seem a bit slower to write to, than say a Lexar card, but unless you are in a big hurry or need to take rapid sequences of shots, this is not a big complaint. I suspect, it's as fast as most cards today aside from Lexar.\nNow, if I was only allowed to buy more than one... Oh, well, I guess [they] want to keep people from harding them at this price.;Viking 128 MB Compact Flash Review

Not great, but pretty good.

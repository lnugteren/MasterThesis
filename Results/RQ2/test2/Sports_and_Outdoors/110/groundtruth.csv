1;1.0;5.0;498.0;I am sooo glad I got this inexpensive manual treadmill instead of an expensive motorized one.  I put it together in about half and hour.  Its a little more of a workout than walking on a level surface (you're walking slightly uphill all the time) so be prepared to stretch your calf muscles after using it.  I also like how light and portable it is.  I can push it out of the way easily when I'm not using it (though folding it up IS a little harder than they claim it is).  I can also shift it easily to watch t.v. while I'm working out, or shift it in another direction and look out my picture window instead (you can jog on it, too). It also takes up a lot less floor space than the huge motorized ones. The metal and rubber surface area that you walk on is less stressful to your joints than walking on concrete or asphalt-there's a little bit of 'give' to it. I didn't think I'd use the little computer console, but its kind of fun to see how fast you're walking and how many calories you've burned when your done.  I also don't have to keep checking my pedometer to see how far I've gone.  The clock is 'off' though, it'll tell you you've walked for five minutes when you've walked only about three minutes.  Also, when putting it together, they  forgot to include the screws that hold the computer console onto the handlebars.  However, when I called them about it, I immediately was on-line with a courteous REAL person, and they mailed the missing screws to me promptly  (in about three days).  My treadmill came pre-lubricated, but after a couple of weeks of use I noticed it was 'sticking' a little.  I lifted up the belt in a few places and just sprayed on some WD-40, and I was gliding along again just fine.;Love this treadmill!
35;2.0;5.0;275.0;"I am a fit lady, working out most days of the week.  I also have a very expensive Sole Elliptical that costs almost 10X what this little treadmill costs.  I like switching it up.  This $149 treadmill is totally worth it.  If it lasts a year, I will have gotten my money out of it as far as I'm concerned.\n\nIf you are not fit, you  might only be able to withstand about one minute on the treadmill.  After all, you are going uphill at a 12.5% (this is more than some motorized treadmills) incline and there is no way to adjust that.  Don't be discouraged though.  This thing will build fitness very fast - faster than speedwalking or jogging in my opinion.  Just jump on a few times a day for however long you can stay on.  Each day, increase the time of your sessions.  Or do intervals.  Get off of it, walk around until you recover, then jump back on.  If you put a 2 x 4 under the back of the treadmill to decrease the incline, you probably won't be able make the belt move. It's built with an incline because you need the gravity to make the belt move.\n\nYes, the belt sticks...until you find your groove.  Do not lean over to make the belt continue moving as you'll hurt your back.  What I found is just a slight bend in the knees is all you need.  Keep the back straight!  Once you find your ""spot,"" the belt moves fine.  Even if it stops occasionally, who cares?  You will need to hold on with at least one hand.  People complain about that.  Well, this is so intense you don't need to swing your arms.  And if you want an upper body workout, do standard push-ups, or push-ups against a wall.\n\nYou can run on the treadmill.  I don't understand why people are saying you can't.  You can run if you are very fit.  If not, run a few seconds if you want to.  If you run three miles a day on a flat surface, no you won't be able to run three miles on an incline at first.  But you will be able to run and increase your time if you want to.  Who knows, you might want to eventually buy an incline trainer (some are wicked with a 40% incline).\n\nIf you just want to zone out, you might want a motorized treadmill.  Nothing wrong with zoning out for one to two hours a day either.  It depends on how much money you want to spend and how you want to exercise.\n\nOh...it was easy to put together.  The metal plate (on the bottom) between the frame and the tightening knob was bent so the right knob wouldn't screw all the way in.  The two screws that screw the control bar to the handle bars were not the right size for the holes or vice-versa.  This is ok as the overlap of the two pieces is enough that friction will keep them together.  I replaced the double A battery immediately but haven't checked to see if the speed is correct but the console ""seems"" to be working as it goes through the different modes.  For me, the time is what I am interested in.\n\nI think most people's complaints stem from the fact  that they aren't used to hard workouts.  Once again, work up to longer workouts.  Don't be discouraged.  Also, you can't expect a perfect machine for $149 when good motorized treadmills cost $2000 - $6000.\n\nThe weight limit is 250#.\n\nI hope this helps you make a decision.";Builds Fitness Fast
68;3.0;5.0;297.0;"First off, Amazon...I purchased this on Friday June 22 and it was on my front porch by the 25th! Crazy fast delivery. Anyways. I was asked by a longtime friend to be a Bridesmaid in her wedding next Summer. My chunkiness prevented me from being a dress person so I figured now was as good a time as any to start getting into a shape other than oddly oblongish. I liked going for walks and would try to go out a few times a week to maintain my weight but with summer, the elements were against me and the heat and bugs were a major deterrent in my walking regimen. I wanted to tone and slim down, to actually lose weight...not just stay the same weight I had always been. So I looked around at gym memberships...way too expensive for my tastes and the thought of my thunder thighs being on display for all to see was definitely not appealing. Plus, you never use it as much as you say you will so that's money down the drain. Motorized treadmills are in the thousands! I'm made of fat, but not money! Nope, nope, nope.\n\nSo here I am. I looked at a bunch of different options and found out these manual treadmills. At first I wasn't sure how exactly this would work, I thought it would be akin to Sisyphus pushing a giant boulder up a hill or Fred Flintstone taking his family out for Bronto Burgers in the Flintmobile. With rheumatoid arthritis and bad knees at 27, I need exercise but it has to be low impact. I got this thing within 3 days of ordering it. I'm the type of girl who likes putting things together, so setup was a breeze! Here a screw, there a screw, and it was up and running in no time...pun intended! The belt was a lot smoother than I thought it would be. It didn't take very long before I found my stride and got used to the rhythm of the movement. As a 5'7"" female this is the perfect size for me and the incline is easy on the knees. It has a nice little digital display on it that counts the calories, miles, time, and speed...easily interchanged with the push of one central button or you can put it on scan mode where it flashes between time/distance/calories simultaneously. I used to have it in my living room but have since moved it into my bedroom and it fits in right between my bed and entertainment unit. My room is pretty small but this thing really doesn't take up much space even when it's not folded up. Storing it when I need more room is as simple as removing the two big side screws, folding the tread up and securing it in place with the pre-attached pin. It slides into a small corner, but honestly I don't have it stored for very long.\n\nIt has been about 6 weeks now and I have used it religiously, every day since I bought it. I started off slow until I got into a good routine. Now I am doing over 300 minutes per week, burning at least 300 calories a day on a lower calorie diet, over 2000 calories per week, running over 15 miles per week. I have already lost over 11 pounds! Plus on days where it hits over 100 degrees outside, I can work up a sweat inside the privacy of my 70 degree air conditioned house whenever the motivation hits me to run off some steam. Sometimes I just jump on for a bit while watching a movie or TV show or I put on my special workout music and get so into it I don't even realize how quickly I've already reached my goal. The console has a place for storing the included matching water bottle and an MP3 player or remote control on the other side within easy reach. I love this thing. Seeing my progress being charted on the readout screen daily or weekly motivates me to keep at it, I also made up my own chart on the computer where I chart my weight, calories, time, and distance each week. I'm hoping to hit 20 pounds lost by my Birthday mid September and at this rate, it looks like my goal is within reach. Everyone is commenting on how much trimmer and slimmer I look already and my jeans are actually getting too loose to wear, so I may have to invest in a few new wardrobe pieces. I'd say the $138 I paid for this piece of equipment had definitely paid off!";Gives me a run for my money!
109;4.0;5.0;5.0;"I have been using this for more than 5 years. I use it almost every day. Great thing about this treadmill is that I can work on laptop when I am walking. It is very easy. I have kept a wooden plank on handle bar and then place laptop on it.  Handle bar is parallel to ground and it is not slanted, and so the wooden plank will not slide down. I do not remember walking without working on laptop.\n\nPushing the belt with bear foot is hard; can not walk for long. So wear a shoe with decent grip, then you should be able to go for long time. I go for more than a hour.\n\nI do not run on this, just walking.\n\nBest thing is, I can work on my laptop.";One can work on laptop when walking
2;5.0;4.0;166.0;"This product was pretty much what I expected. It was not too difficult to assemble. However, it should come with some lubricant for the belt, it was a bit ""jerky"" at the beginning. After using some lubricant on the belt it was much smoother.";Treadmill
108;6.0;5.0;125.0;"There's really not much I can add to the other positive reviews for this machine, I think it's all that they say. I like the fact it's maneuverable, and it wasn't at all difficult to put together. I'm a 56 year old female, not fit (anymore) but I was able to put it together with a little thought. You want to use a normal phillips-head screwdriver... something with a decent handle to give you leverage and a better grip. And a normal wrench for the larger bolts at the base. The problem areas were the first step in assembly: putting the screws holding the handles to the console bar--use a regular-handled screwdriver and moderate force; they'll go in fine. The front bottom piece (front support) that goes to the base of the handles...it is a very tight fit, and I had to get on the floor, put one end inside the opening, and push (muscle) the other side over to its opening. This was hard...you may need another person to hold one end or do the pulling/pushing.\n\nI read somewhere there was a 'sticking' issue. I found that this was due to my finding my balance....any motion that causes hesitation or a stop will feel like the tread sticks. I bought the silicone spray that was recommended as well, and had sprayed the backside of the tread before I did very much. It will still stop or feel jerky if your motion isn't complete...walk like you normally walk, and hang onto the handles! It's a balance issue.\n\nI was worried about the 13"" width for the walking surface, but it's fine! I can see where I might be able to jog eventually...but I'm doing well to finish 15-20 minutes just walking. My heart rate is up within a few minutes....the workout is really better than I expected. Lots of glutes, quads, hamstrings...all get a terrific workout. I'm very happy with this machine :)\n\nOh, an added perk: the console is large enough to maybe put a book holder onto it. One of the drawbacks I saw with other manual machines that had only the little computer box, no console. (Computer also works fine....make sure all your wires are connected).";Great workout!
94;7.0;3.0;99.0;The only problem I have with it is that you can't adjust the incline.  It's design makes it naturally incline a bit and more difficult for me (having a heart problem) to walk.  If you need a flat surface, don't get this.  But if you're up for a challenge, by all means.  Also, pay close attention to the belt size (width, legnth)  It's not very much walking space, so if you're not that graceful, spend a little more for a wider belt.;Descent for the money
15;8.0;4.0;53.0;"I found the other reviews really helpful when I decided to purchase, so make sure to read reviews, both good and bad.\n\nIt's lightweight (for something of that size), easy to fold up and roll around. The wider stats machine and cup thingy is really helpful. There is a second, shallower cup where you can place a cell phone or music player, etc. The stats machine is small and somewhat hard to read while walking (maybe it's the dim lighting in my room), but I don't use it because I'd rather track my progress on an app on my phone. However, I love that my walking is what powers the stats machine. No batteries to change (unless it sits for a really long time - the walking recharges the batteries included), so it's entirely self-contained and eco-friendly.\n\nThe incline is somewhat steep, but as others said, you get used to it. However, that may be more difficult for those who already have some trouble walking or are disabled. I'm young and relatively fit. The incline IS important though - it's what makes it easy to start the belt. You could adjust the height by placing something sturdy under the back end, but that could make the machine less sturdy and certainly will make it harder to get the belt moving initially (and perhaps throughout your workout). I don't know whether it would help, but you can get silicone belt lubricants to help keep your belt moving smoothly.\n\nYou will generally want to have your hands on the handles provided, which is awkward at first. Perhaps as I get more used to the machine I'll be able to pump my arms and get an even better cardio workout.\n\nIt's sound is pretty quiet and doesn't travel through the wall to my neighbors. However, as someone said above in the questions part, it CAN be loud if you're a hard walker. If you stomp on it, the sound will carry.\n\nThe packaging and putting together: the machine was all in a box I could move upstairs by myself, though it was a bit awkward (5'2"" woman of average strength). There weren't many parts (5, if I remember), which was a great thing. The instructions were confusing at first and required a few reads. The belt part was already assembled, and the instructions just asked you to make sure it was centered (could have shifted in shipping). Mine happened to be fine. However, I had a big problem that took about 45 minutes to fix: one of the metal side poles' hole at the end was dented. I couldn't fit the top cross-bar into it. I didn't want to return this whole thing for something that simple, so I fought with it for a long time with pliers and any other tools I had in the house. (It was dented inward, so a hammer couldn't do it.) Of course, this was the first step in assembly, so I didn't feel so happy about my purchase at the time. In the end, my much-stronger husband was able to un-dent it enough after four or five tries. After that, assembly was a breeze. I've included a picture of the box when I opened it.";Just what I expected - great, simple, easy to move. Had problems assembling, but assembly was otherwise a breeze
74;9.0;5.0;60.0;This treadmill is excellent for the price and for those with limited space. I've used a lot of different motorized treadmills, elliptical machines, et al. and this one is very sound. It runs smoothly, it isn't very loud, and if it ever starts to get sluggish, the process of lubricating it with something like WD-40 is very simple (just spray it on the underside of the belt -- you don't need to be handy at all). The whole treadmill has a really small footprint, to say nothing of the fact that you can easily fold it up and roll it away, if need be.\n\nMy only disclaimers for this (and all manual treadmills):\n\n1. It is not really possible to take a light stroll on it, as you can do outside on level ground or on an electric treadmill. With the lack of power, the walking deck is at a permanent incline (not super serious but very noticeable) and so, you need to use your legs a lot more to get the belt started and keep it going. It's almost easier to jog on a manual treadmill than it is to walk. The good news is that the incline/manual power will work your legs more and help you burn more calories faster. But it's obviously more strenuous.\n\n2. If you bought this with the hopes of modifying it to hold a laptop or tablet or something (and I did -- I used the Surf Shelf and it fits/works perfectly), it's very unlikely you'll be able to use the keyboard or touch screen in any meaningful way. The incline and manual nature of the treadmill makes you dependent on the hand grips to keep a steady pace. So, you can't really type or anything really precise with your trackpad. It is possible to keep a good pace while holding on with only one hand (so that you can use your other hand for the laptop or your cell phone, etc.) but it's still a manual treadmill and is not ideal as a computer workstation, unfortunately. It's obviously fine if you just wanted to watch DVDs or maybe read articles but if you really wanted to get good emailing, browsing, typing done, you will probably need to spring for an electric treadmill or a exercise bike.;Great but with two caveats
98;10.0;4.0;59.0;"I received the treadmill today (03/16/11)and just as others have said, it only took about 50 minutes to set up.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and put silicone spray on the platform and belt as soon as I set it up.  I got right on it and noticed the belt start to slide immediately to the right.  I followed the instructions in the book and had to tighten the right tension nut about 5 times and then the left one 3 times to get the belt to stay in the middle.  I used it for 1/2 hr non stop without any real issues and boy, what a work out.  The incline may not look that steep, but like others have said, you start to feel it in your calves, hips, back and front of your thighs right away!  I like it!  Here are my Pros and cons;\nPros;\nEasy setup\nProvides good workout\nDecent digital display, I only care about the Time function - to be honest.\nEasy stride motion while walking after silicone spray application.\nI can run on it if I choose - I'm 5'5 and 240lb.  Not a small woman - hence, the reason why I purchased it.\nGood treadmill for the price.\n\nCons;\nSqueaky platform noise on the right side of platform when walking.  I have to check if the preinstalled screws underneath are loose on the right side-my weight could be a factor.\nNot as small and collapseable as it looked.  I also don't like the fact that you have to unscrew some parts each time you want to collapse it.";Very Satisfied So Far....
53;11.0;4.0;48.0;"I read all the reviews before I purchased this and I had a little fear that it was going to be a dud.  But truly it is not.  No, it is not a fancy electric treadmill and it will not function like one.  But you shouldn't hold it to those standards anyway.  Here was my experience with it:\nIt was super cheap...a huge plus because I wanted a treadmill in my house so I could just roll out of bed and start doing some activity. And there was no way I could afford the electric models.\n\nThe shipping was hassle-free and FREE (because of the super saving shipping).  It arrived at my door 11 days after I purchased it.  The packaging was light enough and compact enough that I could move it into my house without any help (a big plus as I live alone).\n\nIt was truly a cinch to put together and I put it together myself in about 20 minutes (I just looked at the pictures in the manual and took it one step at a time).  I did not have any of the issues other people identified regarding having to shove pieces together, etc.\n\nThe product is sturdy enough and doesn't feel like it will break apart (I am 5'8 at 199 pounds and I feel completely comfortable on it).  I can even drag it around my house with ease (I don't bother folding it up as it slides on carpet really easily without folding it up).\n\nWalking on it at first is tricky, I won't lie...but it is absolutely doable!  I did not purchase the lubricant stuff and therefore am reviewing it from the lubricant-free stand point.  What I found was this: I do have to hold on to the handlebars (but that is okay as it is the right size for me and feels really comfortable); it does stop and feel jerky at first (I found that walking at the very top and keeping a steady walking gate, however, eliminating that jerkiness 99% of the time); once you find your walking gate it works great; if you have an expectation of the perfect treadmill, you will be disappointed.\n\nHowever, if you want a little treadmill that doesn't cost a lot, is sturdy enough, is easily movable, is quiet enough to watch a movie while walking (it is not silent by any means but it is quiet enough to not be annoying), allows you to get a good enough walk in without leaving your home (I too was working up a sweat at 20 minutes and it felt great!), then this is the treadmill for you!  I personally feel it was $149 well spent and I will be using it a lot.";It is what it is and that's alright.
87;12.0;5.0;55.0;"I'm trying to be healthier and decided walking should be an important part of that process.  I wanted a machine that would allow me to walk indoors during the winter and also when it's raining.  I also did not want to spend an arm and a leg on a fancy machine.  I picked this machine and it is wonderful.  I put it together by myself in about a half hour.  It's light weight but very sturdy.  I am about 5'10"" and weigh about 205 pounds.  I've had no issues with the machine at all.  It's much more rigorous than actually walking though.  I get a fantastic cardio workout just by keeping up a casual walking pace.  I now use it on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for 30 minutes, no matter the weather outside. I don't run, so I don't know if the treadmill would allow that but I seriously doubt it.  If you are like me, and just want to walk, I can't recommend it enough.  One of the best features is how quiet it is.  I can actually watch TV while on the treadmill.  People in the other part of the house have no idea when I'm walking on it.  I've had it now for about 6 weeks and I am very pleased.";Wonderful Purchase
105;13.0;5.0;54.0;"This definitely was easy to put together, I had it done it less that half an hour by myself (female, 50). I did place it on top of a bed for assembly then lowered it to the floor when it came to the final steps. I was used to using a motorized treadmill, so the manual part took a little getting used to, but it actually gives you a better work out. I like the handles on this model although i add handtowels to each side to absorb and for more comfort. I also like the larger digital monitor with waterbottle holder and tray, just makes it more convenient for the MP3player ... I put a long rug upside down under it to protect the wood floor and can actually easily scoot it from one room to the other. For the price, a great purchase and I am very happy with it. Still miss my motorized version, but this was SO much more affordable, WAY quieter and uses NO electricity - and being ""self propelled"" you work up a sweat faster.

61;14.0;1.0;42.0;I never write reviews, and I'm taking the time to do this because I'm so angry at this thing and I want to spare others from ordering one. I don't know if some of the five-star reviews here are plants from the company that manufactures it, or maybe I just happened to get a defective one, but my god. First of all, you can't tighten the belt enough to run freely, with your arms swinging through the air, because the belt just speeds up and you fall off the back. So I spend my runs gripping the handlebars like I'm in physical rehab, even with the nuts set to the point they can barely be moved (I'm a 33-year-old male). Then there's the noise it occasionally makes. Sometimes it's an extremely loud clicking, other times it sounds more like some kind of engine. It will happen for a couple mins in the middle of my run, then fade away. It's so loud I honestly worry I'll hear my neighbors walking up the stairs and knocking at my door in the middle of my run to complain. Then there's the messed up display. Sometimes at the end of my run, I start sprinting for the final minute or so. The display can't handle that. It will suddenly tell me that I'm running maybe 1.5 MPH (or just now, 0.0) And the timer even freezes up when I do that. The TIMER!! DO NOT BUY THIS;BUY SOMETHING BETTER
0;15.0;5.0;51.0;I am person that the package is always missing some parts, the directions are not clear, and I can never get the darn thing assembled in a reasonable amount of time, not so with this product and assembly was a snap!  Great product and needed no belt adjustments right out of the box.  The slight elevation gives a good workout for someone my age of 66 years old. I am more than completely satisfied with this product.  I don't recommend this product for running but for slow to medium to a brisk walk this is excellent.  Good job Amazon for offering this treadmill.;Outstanding Product
75;16.0;5.0;42.0;"Before I bought this I had never even used a manual treadmill so I had no idea what to expect, other than what I learned from the reviews.  I chose this particular model because it had 4 out of 5 stars, and I read reviews that said it was not difficult to assemble, which is important to me because I am not good at putting things together at all.  Let me say that I was really anxious to get it, and I was thrilled when it arrived way earlier than they said it would.  The delivery date was originally supposed to be between February 24-27th and I got it on Feb. 21st.  I put it together in about 45 minutes to an hour and I actually had fun doing it because the instructions were very simple and broken down step by step, I did not get confused at all while assembling it which is the first time that has ever happened to me.  It is fun to walk on; I was worried that it would be very difficult to use because it's a manual but it isn't.  In fact, I feel like it's way better than an electric treadmill because the motion is natural and the belt moves because I am the one making it move, as opposed to an electric one where you have to sruggle to walk/run at the exact speed that you have set.  I love the fact that as soon as I stop moving my feet the belt stops.  I can change the song playing on my computer or get something for my kids really quickly and get back on and start moving again.  It is super quiet, which I love!!!!!  The only thing I would say that is at all negative is that one screw was missing, which didn't matter because my husband has lots of screws and I just grabbed one that looked the same.  All the tools needed to assemble it were included.  One thing I would advise is when you open the instruction manual don't freak out...the first picture shows a ton of parts, but many of them are already put together for you.  Turn the page and the first step is shown very simply and so are the following steps.  This is the first review I have ever written but I wanted to write it because I am so pleased with this product.";I love it, exceeded all my expectations!!!
4;17.0;1.0;62.0;"Extremely unstable. Hard to walk on the belt.  Additionally, I  get static shocks from holding on to the metal bars on the sides therefore I need to grip the rubber part on top but that makes walking even more unstable. It is not a ""smooth quiet operation"" as the ad states. I will return the item.  I wish I had not thrown away the box. I know I will never use it now.  It is a waste of time and money.";Denise Austin Easy up Manual Treadmill
103;18.0;4.0;39.0;So far so good. The treadmill was a piece of cake to assemble. Very simple and it took about 1/2 hour from start to finish. Adjusting the belt was a snap. There is a screw on each side of the end of the base frame for adjustments. It only needed a minor turn of one screw to move it over to the left. Everything worked fine. It is impossible to find a manual treadmill anywhere in town. I was a little worried ar first, wondering what shape this would be in after shipping half way across the country from California, but it was in great shape, so this was a very good experience having it shipped right to my doorstep.\nThe only thing that I can say as a possible negative....it is a bit hard to get used to walking on a manual treadmill. It's not like you are just out for a walk. Your muscles actually have to do a bit of work as you walk, as you have to hold onto the hand rails and work your legs, so you do work up a sweat, and your muscles do get worked out. I've never used a power treadmill, like a gym has, so I don't know if they work you out as much as a manual one does, but I would think that they don't. On those you just get on it and walk. But for $139 compared to $500-$900 they wanted in town for a power treadmill, this will do!;Nice treadmill
64;19.0;3.0;33.0;"I purchased this treadmill because I wanted a simple solution to walking (and I hoped jogging) in rainy or cold weather.  I felt that the price ($140) was a healthy alternative to the thousands for motor-driven treadmills. Maybe one day I'll buy one, or just move somewhere that's always sunny.\n\nLet me say first that it does what it is supposed to do.  In only 15 minutes, you can really work up a sweat just walking because:\n\nA. It's at a slight tilt\nB. You really have to watch your balance and posture\nC. There is no real way to control the speed (as you would with a motor-driven)\n\nThe assembly was simple enough, I got it up and going in only 20 minutes.\nI do like this product, however i gave it 3 stars for some good reasons.\n\n1. The ""Easy Up"" would be much easier if it was a quick-connect system instead of the two knobby screws on either side. Ironically, it uses a spring loaded pin to hold it upright... but they didn't think to use something similar to put it down?  (FYI, you can't use it without those screws or the whole unit gets wobbly.\n\n2. No tension control on the fly-wheel.  I'd love to put a little tension on it because then I really could go for a light jog.  If you try now, your own weight just gets it going too fast.\n\n3. You MUST hold on to the upper (padded) handles or the unit will start and stop because you're not high up enough to have your own weight pull you back down.  Unlike motor-driven, you don't stand in the middle.  So just get uphill a bit and leave plenty of space in front of the unit so you don't kick a wall or your favorite pet.\n\nTo anyone who has issues with the mat moving back and forth on the spinner, the instructions say quite clearly that there are two adjustments at the tail end of the treadmill to control the angle of the conveyor belt. They probably just need a tweak to straighten them out.\n\nOverall I'm glad I bought it.";A cost effective solution to speed walking inside
66;20.0;4.0;31.0;"I purchased this treadmill 3 weeks ago.  My husband and I are both overweight and inactive.  I am 5'2"" 155 lb., and my husband is 6'8"" 255 lb.  This treadmill has been great for us.  After reading the reviews, we were concerned that it would be too small for my husband.  He needs to slouch a little to reach the handle bars, but his gait fits on treadmill fine.\n\nWe both have been walking 3.5 mph for 20 minutes, three times a week for the past 2 weeks.  My husband is already down one belt hole, and I've lost 2 inches off my true waist, 1 inch off my pants waist.\n\nThis little treadmill is perfect for couch potatoes that want to get in some exercise at a moderate level.  I would say it is not suitable for people that want to train for a marathon or get into great shape. I don't think running is really possible because you have to hold on to the handle bars.  I also think if you are severely overweight this treadmill might be too narrow for you.  The belt is only 13 inches wide.  And the space between the handle bars is only 18 inches.\n\nIt is about as loud as a dishwasher.  You might need to turn up the TV a few notches to hear over it, but it is not annoyingly loud at all.\n\nWhen we first tried it, the belt was jerky.  We applied WD 40 to the underside of the belt.  After that first walk, it doesn't jerk.  We learned quickly how to keep the belt going smoothly.\n\nWe haven't experienced any static shock from the handlebars or the belt moving to one side.  The incline is not too steep.  Overall, a great little [cheap] treadmill for getting daily exercise.";Good for Couch Potatoes, not serious runners
59;21.0;1.0;27.0;I am really disappointed in this product. The conveyor part did not spin properly and I would be walking and it would cause me to stop about every thirty seconds. My husband put it together pretty easily. He also disassembled it easily and we returned it. I rarely go to the trouble of returning items but  we returned this. I am also really surprised about how many positive reviews it had, maybe I received a dud.;So cheap I had to return it...
48;22.0;1.0;24.0;Unsafe product. Yes, its manual, but it's not smooth. You're too busy hanging on for dear life rather than enjoying your treadmill experience. The frame is too small and rickety for such use (the hanging on for dear life part).\n\nIf it was smoother, the work out WOULD be worth it since its naturally on an incline and it makes you work it. But, its not worth risking your safety over. Just buy a power driven model so you don't have to wonder if you're going to trip and break a leg.\n\nIts so dangerous that I refused to give it away. I just disassembled it and tossed it out on separate trash days to avoid someone from adopting it for themselves.;Worst product ever. Too many positive Amazon reviews

U can use WD-40 but that thing stinks.\n\n  - You can run without hands IF u have something to wrap around the handle bar and ur waist. Don't try this if ur under 15. It can cause serious injury.\n\n  - If your belt moving side to side, u can adjust the tension at the back roller. My didn't have problem.

However, the front has rubber padding. To fix the back legs u can just wrap bike tube around the steel or use electric tape.\n\n  - If you want to put it away u need to undo the lock knob. If you want to use it, u need to put on the lock knob.\n\n  - Frame move side to side if u running too fast.\n\n  - One of the screw on the plywood came off while setting up.\n\n  - The left side handlebar screw won't tighten up (the hole is bigger than the screw itself).\n\nGot it for 124 $ free shipping. no tax, and 13$ off from diff website it was a labor day sale.\n\nMy workout plan: walk 2.5miles @ 3.6mph => take 5 mins break => another 2.5 miles I do this every other day.";Pretty good but can be better
26;24.0;4.0;20.0;First of all, let me say that I love this treadmill. I, personally, like this manual treadmill more than motorized treadmills I've tried in the past, but it's the first treadmill I've ever owned myself, so that my have something to do with it. My girlfriend disagrees vehemently and is still very much on the side of the motorized treadmill, so there's that. BUT, if you don't have a lot of cash to spend, a manual treadmill like this is a perfectly fine alternative, and don't let anyone tell you different.\n\nNow, my only real complaint about this treadmill was the noise. The first day we used it was fine, but over the next couple of days it started to develop a really loud, annoying squeak, and the faster you went, the more and louder it squeaked.\n\nI did some tinkering and found out that the reason this happens is because of the way the treadmill is built. They put a thick, plastic board under the belt as a walking surface, and that is screwed into four metal supports underneath with 12 screws (four on each end, and four down the center). Something about the properties of the plastic board or the way it's connected causes the squeaking noise.\n\nThis is how I fixed it:\nFirst, I loosened the back roller all the way by taking the bolts out. Then I took the front roller off, so that the belt was loose enough that I could get to all of the center-most screws with the included screwdriver. Then I completely removed those four center-most screws. I then loosened the remaining eight screws the TINIEST bit. This alone reduced the squeaking noticeably, but the real trick is to fill the space between the plastic board and the metal supports near where the screws connect on either side with some sort of buffer. I used eight index cards. After I did this the squeaking completely stopped, and the treadmill is pretty darned quiet, even while running.\n\nI hope this helps!;This is How to Make it Quieter!
72;25.0;4.0;23.0;"First, when assembling this, start right away by taping down the wiring ends that protrude from inside the tubing of the frame, or you will wind up re-threading the wires thru the tubes and fishing the ends back out of the holes in the tubes with tweezers, a crochet hook, or a hemostat etc., IF you can get the wires to not wad up in the tube halfway to the hole.  This is awkward and requires shaking, poking, etc.  The wires should have been taped in place at the factory.\n\nThe rectangularly-bent piece of tubing at bottom front was bent nearly a half-inch too far to fit into the holes in the vertical frame member.  Why could this not have been checked for fit at the factory and corrected there, or made with a jig that ensured a correct fit in the first place?  I had to stick two wrench handles into the open ends of the tubing and spread the ends by force until they were spaced widely enough to fit.\n\nSome of the screws, bolts, and nuts seem like they should have been more robust.  Although the box includes appropriate manual tools, things went much better and faster with a 13mm socket and ratchet, along with a battery-powered Phillips screwdriver.\n\nThe hand grip areas need to be covered with decent cushioning material to afford a good grip, rather than being merely slippery bare painted metal.  I will probably get some tape or other material to cover them.\n\nUPDATE: The two points of floor contact at the rear of the treadmill concentrate too much pressure on the floor. Even if a mat and/or rug is used, they could easily damage hardwood or vinyl flooring and any rug or mat. They should be replaced by a horizontal bar that distributes weight more widely, as does the front support structure. especially since they bear most of the user's weight. I recommend that users place a metal plate or at least a sturdy board between treadmill and mat at the rear, but this means that you must also support the front with similar material of equal thickness.  Also, the top structure with hand grips, etc., should be redesigned to allow the treadmill to be folded more compactly.\n\nThe instructions and illustrations are sufficiently clear to allow most people to put the treadmill together well in a reasonable amount of time AFTER dealing with such problems as wires falling out of tubing and forcing parts to fit.\n\nAll of the above issues should have been resolved at the factory at an additional cost of less than $10, much less than the value of my time and aggravation, along with additional purchases.  I have a PhD in Industrial Engineering, so I know how easy and inexpensive it would have been to take care of these problems during manufacture.\n\nHaving said that, once I got the treadmill assembled AND LUBRICATED, it works pretty much as one would hope.  One benefit is that the instructions say that we can use WD-40 to lube the belt, which is MUCH cheaper than silicone belt lubricants, and seems to be similar stuff.  Getting enough lube on the underside of the belt's full length is vital to ensuring correct function; otherwise, you'll be fighting stoppages and possibly falling.  You can also fall if you aren't careful when using the unit with the belt well-lubricated.\n\nI am right at the upper size limit (6-3+; 250 lbs; 33-inch leg inseam, size 12EE shoes) for this treadmill, and do not recommend it for people who are heavier or taller.  The instructions for adjusting screws to correct for belt creep were just right, and the belt no longer creeps to one side.\n\nUseful advice for stretching muscles and tendons is also included and should be heeded.  If you are used to a powered treadmill, do not expect to keep up the same speed on this one, because you are providing power.  I wish the slope were adjustable.  It might be possible to adjust the slope, especially upward, by putting something stable under the front and/or back end(s) of the treadmill, but I haven't tried it.\n\nThe treadmill should be used with an appropriate mat, and is convenient to fold compactly for storage with the mat in a small closet in my den or under a bed or behind a sofa.  I can take it out and set it up in less than a minute for use while watching TV or a DVD.  It is also portable enough to take along (with mat) in the car on long trips.\n\nUPDATE: I sent a copy of this review to the email address given in the package.  Within a few hours, the vendor replied as follows:\n""Thank you for sending your Amazon review to us. Your opinion is very professional and valuable to us. We will discuss your points to the manufacturer so our product can be improved.""";"Assembly issues; some parts seem flimsy. Needs better hand grips. Works well when lubed, even for max-size man."
9;26.0;4.0;15.0;OKAY - let's talk about this thing.\n1) It folds up!  But we never do because it's harder to use when it's folded up.  Am I right?!\n2) It's small.  Pay attention to the dimensions.  I knew it would be kind of small, but the walking space is what matters.  It worked out though because it fits perfectly in our walk-in closet out of the way of the rest of the house.\n3) It has a CUP HOLDER!\n4) You might fall off at first.  You have to get used to the rhythm of the machine.\n5) If you run, you WILL fall off.  It's for walking.\n6) If there is a wall behind you, and you fall off, you may put a hole in the wall.  Be mindful of your surroundings.  (this didn't happen, but i was thinking about the possibility).\n7) Check the bolts every few weeks to make sure they are still tight.\n\nThis is not a replacement for your gym, but it's a great treadmill to have around for those days when you just couldn't make it there.;Just walk it off!
29;27.0;5.0;18.0;"I already had a home gym machine, designed mainly for strength training. When my doctor suggested that I start using a treadmill, for elevated blood pressure, I thought I would need to get rid of the home gym that I really like. I searched on 'mini treadmill' and the Phoenix 98510 came up as one of the search results. I did some research decided to purchase it. I am glad now that I did.\n\nThe footprint and weight of this machine is much less than your average manual treadmill. It easily fits into my limited floor space and can be folded up in a few minutes. Having said that, there are some drawbacks.\n\nI am a 6' 11"", 175 pound male with a 32"" inseam and 59 years of age. When I use this device in a normal walking manner, it works very well for me. When I try to 'power walk' and take longer strides, my back foot will sometimes ride up on the back roller at the end of each stride. I do get a good workout with just normal walking, but the 'power walk' thing is out, for me.\n\nThe tread did occasionally stick when starting, after I got it going it was fine. I was already aware of this and had purchased some silicone spray designed for treadmills. After about fifteen squirts from the spray bottle, to the bottom of the tread, that problem went away. WD-40 makes a silicone spray in an aerosol can that is less expensive than the spray I bought. I cannot say if one is better or not, just another option. Do not use the well known WD-40, it is not silicone based and may degrade the plastic / rubber components on this device.\n\nWhy five stars? I specifically needed a small footprint treadmill. I do realize that smaller machines may not work quite the same as something twice their size and price. I got a good value for what I paid.\n\nI get a good cardio work out, that is all I need.

12;31.0;2.0;13.0;I purchased this treadmill due to the tremendous amount of positive reviews. My experience has been less than stellar.\n\nPRO:\n* Item was packaged securely and arrived in pristine condition.\n* Very simple to set up. Took about ten minutes from time of opening box to testing the treadmill out\n* Low cost\n* Very light weight\n* Portable and easy to store.\n\nCON:\n* The traction belt is very narrow and short. Walking is unnatural and running is impossible. The only way to run is to take baby run steps at the very tip of the traction belt while distributing your weight upon the handles. This is really not a natural movement.\n* The treadmill is not very secure and wobbles tremendously during use\n* The Traction Belt is very jerky even after using treadmill lubrication.\n* The need to constantly hold onto the rails. If you do not hold onto the rails, you will either fly off or jerk to a sudden stop. This wears your arms out and causes an unnatural rhythm to your gait.\n* The counter either does not keep count properly or fails altogether randomly.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nI have had manual treadmills in the past. The cheap cost of this item is not worth it for the problems you will encounter. I would recommend spending more for a better model of manual treadmill or taking the plunge for an electric treadmill with motor.;Less than stellar item

71;34.0;3.0;17.0;This was a Mother's Day present to myself.  I had a treadmill a few years ago and loved it, but it broke and never got replaced.  I'm not the type to walk outside, especially when it's hot so I really wanted to find a replacement.  I chose this one as it's a bit smaller for the space I have and it's manual, which means you do all the work.  I wanted to give it 5 stars, but I'll tell you why I only gave it three.\n\nAfter opening the box, finding the instructions and checking the parts list my son and I were ready to assemble.  What really should have taken less than 30 minutes took well over an hour.  Some of the screws did not fit the holes.  Making it even worse, the holes that should have been there weren't.  Thank goodness my husband has tools and extra nuts and bolts, otherwise it would have went back.  I ended up drilling two holes in the frame so I could put the screws in and I had to find two bolts that would fit into the holes already there so I could bolt it all together.  If I could give stars for assembly I'd give it one, so just be aware of these issues if you choose to purchase it.  Others have had good luck but I wasn't one of them.\n\nAs far as actually using it, I give it a 5.  The belt moves smoothly and it's a good workout.  It is up at an angle so when you walk it's like walking up a small incline.  You will have to hang on but let me tell you, you're legs will feel it!  Overall I am happy with it and plan to use it a lot.  If it wasn't for the assembly issue I would have given it 5 stars but I think 3 is fair.;I would give 5 stars, but...
37;35.0;5.0;15.0;Having an expensive $500+ electronic treadmill break on me, I decided to go for a different and less cheaper route. I wanted a much more compact treadmill for my parents and upon searching, I stumbled across a manual treadmill. I immediately fell in love with them due to their small sizes and low prices!\n\nWhat I personally love about this Phoenix manual treadmill:\n\nNo electricity needed - Because there is motor powering this treadmill, there is no concern for the spike in your monthly electricity bill! Where I come from, electricity is pretty expensive and so if that is one concern for you as well, picking up a manual treadmill will do absolute wonders.\n\nCompact - This baby is extremely compact in size. Therefore, if you live in a small dorm room or just don't have the space to fit in a regular sized treadmill, this is for you as well. The entire length of the treadmill is less than 50 inches! The fact that you can also fold up the treadmill when you're done with it is also a great feature.\n\nSturdiness - The build quality of this treadmill is pretty good for something so cheap. It feels very sturdy for casual walking.\n\nElectronic Panel - This treadmill is equipped with a small panel that tracks a couple of important metrics. It can help you keep track of distance, calories burned, elapsed time and speed. It's pretty awesome because the meter actually stops when you stop walking/running on the treadmill as well and it will pick right back up when you start again. Very handy indeed.\n\nSetup - This treadmill is a breeze to setup and can usually be done with just one person. There is only one part of the setup that might require another helper depending on your age and strength. Other than that, every nut and bolt is correctly labeled and as long as you can follow simple directions, you will get this treadmill up and running in no time!\n\nQuietness - Because there is no motor powering the treadmill, you reduce a lot of the extra noise. Therefore, you can definitely use the treadmill while watching TV or listening to the radio without fear of waking the neighbors.\n\nThings to consider BEFORE you purchase this treadmill:\n\nPurpose - This treadmill in my opinion is suitable for walking purposes only! The walking area/belt is not only very short in length but also narrow as well! This brings me to the second caution in that this treadmill is almost impossible to use without holding on to the handle. Yes, this even includes slow walking. I can guarantee you that as soon as you let go that within a second or two you will immediately slide backwards. This I believe is due to the treadmill being a manual type. Because you are using your own weight/momentum to power the treadmill, it is very hard to maintain a constant speed and also, the treadmill is at a slight incline. Therefore, once again, I only can recommend this treadmill for walking purposes only! Your miles may definitely vary though.\n\nMaintenance - Because the treadmill is powered by your own weight and momentum and not via a electric motor, you will have to occasionally lube the belt when it gets to squeaky or you notice that you need to work a lot harder to move the belt. In fairness, I believe this also needs to be done on electronic treadmills as well. I just think this needs to be done more on these manual type treadmills.\n\nIncline - As the picture shows, the treadmill base is at a incline and there is no way to adjust this. This incline is necessary because once again, it uses your own weight and momentum to move/slide the belt. This slight incline is about 7.5 inches from the ground up at the very front of the treadmill. Younger crowds will definitely not have a problem with this but for the older citizens, you might want to heavily consider this fact prior to ordering this product. The good news is that once you get use to the power needed to keep the treadmill continuously moving with your feet/legs, you should have no problems with it. I found that you can go very slow on this treadmill as well so just because it's powered by your own momentum does not mean you have to run like an over-hyped mouse on a wheel!\n\nAll in all, I feel that this manual treadmill is perfect for our uses. My parents definitely cannot run and so getting an expensive machine will do them no good as they probably won't get to use the various advanced settings anyways. This treadmill is perfect for those times when you can't go outside for your morning walk due to bad weather or for those times when you just feel too lazy to step out of the house! As long as the treadmill itself doesn't fall apart (which I don't think it will anytime soon), I feel extremely happy with this purchase.;Perfect for Indoor Walking!

25;40.0;5.0;12.0;I was wary of buying due to some of the bad reviews but I am glad I did. Here is an unbiased review.\nI am single, out of shape and hate being around other people so the gym is out. I also have back injuries and walking is one of the few things that doesn't leave me in a fetal ball afterwards. I was able to bring all the parts upstairs in two trips, with the directions it took about 15 minutes to put together. The nuts, bolts, screws and washers are in a blister packet with the tools you will need. Everything went together fairly easily. When I first got on the belt movement would abruptly stop. It took about three minutes to find my step on this machine. Try standing a little further back and walk normally, take full strides not fast half steps. There is some noise, a soft shush of the belt as it moves but not as loud as some motorized ones.  One reviewer was appalled because it has no motor. Nope, this guys in manual and you are the motor. There is an incline, it will make you sweat a little but its not that bad and as I said earlier, standing further back helps with this too. I don't use the display because it does read a little off. I have a fitbit so I don't care. This is a sturdy machine, I am about 167lbs and its not rickety under me.;its great for the price

But I'm giving the other equipment away and am keeping this treadmill.\n\nThe treadmill is inclined at a 12.5 percent grade, it rises five inches in its forty-inch length. That's a good hill, and with the friction, it feels like you're pushing a small cart up a smooth hill. The resistance and speed is easy to control: you lean forward a bit and your weight makes the belt speed up and you go faster. If you stand straight up it's hard to start and move the belt, so you go slower. The panel has four settings, speed, distance, calories burned, and scan, which rotates through the other three. The readings are cumulative, and they're all reset by holding the button for about four seconds.\n\nWith this treadmill set up in my room, I can simply walk over to it and spend a few minutes exercising whenever I want. And I find that short periods spread out during the day work much better for me. The accumulating ability of the time, distance, and calorie meter allows me to exercise in periods and still see how much time I spend exercising during the day.\n\nSince I've been doing this, I feel much better, my hikes and long walks are much easier, and I recover more quickly. My heart rate has lowered, and I'm seeing all the effects of regular exercise without tedium or boring discipline. I'm usually huffing, puffing and starting to sweat by the time I get even slightly bored on the treadmill, so I just quit and come back another time. And I can wear what I want as I exercise, including nothing if I so choose.\n\nI live a fairly sedentary life, and have tried everything to exercise more. I used to run 8 miles a day when I was young, but now it's hard to find an hour and the energy for a long walk around the block. Sure, I get out periodically to hike and walk, but without regularly exercising in the interim, it takes a lot out of me and I'm tired for a couple of days afterwards. This treadmill solves the problem for me, rain or shine.\n\nAs many have said in their reviews, this treadmill is really for walking and not running. Nonetheless, I have had the speedometer up to five and six miles per hour, but only as a test because it really takes effort. Normally, I walk around three mph, sometimes up to four. But even at three you'll get a good workout -- at least, I get a good workout. It's not easy walking up a 12.5% grade at four mph, pushing something equal to the friction of the belt.\n\nIf you're a marathoner, stick to the tracks. But if you want a convenient, easy way to get some good, low-impact, conveniently accessible exercise, then this treadmill may be for you.;I love this treadmill!
56;44.0;1.0;12.0;"Beware of reviews! This is not a great machine. The saying is true ""you get what you pay for"".  I wish I had opened the box and tried it before my 30 days because I would have returned it. Although sturdy, the treadmill sticks and the work out becomes very unstable and it works you harder than you anticipate. I would not recommend this. I used the Pyroil Silicone Lubricant Spray as they recommend but it does not work well at all.";Be Careful of reviews
70;45.0;5.0;12.0;"I never liked going to the gym to exercise, or going out to run, so I decided to buy myself a treadmill. I don't have a lot of space, so I got this manual fold-up treadmill instead. The size isn't too big. Assembly was easy with the help of another person. The two screws at the top of the base were hard to put in, but I managed it without needing any power tools. I've used this product for a while now, and I've never had issues with a skewed belt. I read the instructions to adjust the belt, but I think adjusting the sides individually and test-walking the tread will solve the problem based on how far the belt shifts. The only thing I don't like about the treadmill is the noise. I actually can jog or sprint on this (which is good) but it does get a little loud. The wheel makes a lot of noise with jogging/running, but it's no big deal. I'm just glad I can run on this! Other people mention that it's dangerous to use because it's ""unstable."" For a petite girl like me, running isn't going to make this topple over. I imagine you'd have to be of larger stature to really get this bouncing out of hand.\n\nI don't recommend this to older adults or people who don't have a good center of gravity as the incline may cause them to run and fall off the end. They may be better off trying something with a safety strap to go around their middle. My mother tried to walk on this, but it looked like she was putting all her weight towards the back. So.. of course she was holding onto the rails for dear life and running to keep at the high end of the incline... As for me, this treadmill is perfect. I've been able to run without using the rails too. It runs well. Folds up nicely. It's just the noise level that bothers me, but that's tolerable.";My First Manual Treadmill
7;46.0;1.0;6.0;When I purchased this, it had an average score of 4 1/2 stars.  I wish I had waited.  I was not impressed.\n\nThe tricky part about this treadmill is that I just can't use to walk at a steady pace.  I had to keep sprinting to keep the belt moving.  I used it every day for several months, but I would tire out to quickly to get in a decent workout.  I have since upgraded to a real treadmill, and the pounds have started to shed.  I spend a good 45 minutes to an hour on my current treadmill 5-6 days a week.  When I was using this thing, I would be lucky to get in 5-10 minutes.  Let's just say that I have put on more miles on my real treadmill in a month than I put on this thing in over a year.\n\nI almost gave this two stars because it did prove to be a great place to hang clean laundry.;Stay far-far away.
107;47.0;4.0;14.0;This treadmill was a little hard to assemble, getting all of the holes to line up was a little bit difficult.  I like the lower handles as I'm shorter and my husband likes the higher bar as he is much taller.  This machine works for us both even though I like to walk and my husband likes to run.;Manual Treadmill
8;48.0;4.0;7.0;I bought this on sale, and my final cost was just over $110. It was definitely worth it! The reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because I had some difficulty during setup, and it takes some getting used to, but what do you expect for a $100-$180 treadmill?! Here's the breakdown:\n\nSetup - The instructions are basic (picture and a couple sentences) but fairly easy to understand. I was able to set this up on my own, although anyone who has difficulties holding something with some weight to it up while securing a bolt might want to have someone to help on standby. The main issue that I ran into is that the front support (the piece bracing it on the ground in the front of the treadmill in the image) did not seem to fit. I finally had to turn it on it's side and sit on one of the ends to get it to slide in. I actually had to do that several times before it worked, and I weigh just under 250 lbs (hence the need for the treadmill). Other than that, it was pretty easy.\n\nUse - You WILL have to use the handlebars, at least one, while using the treadmill. A lot of people have complained that it was difficult to get the treadmill to move, but I had the opposite problem. I got on it and it moved with my body weight alone! I wasn't so much powering it but trying to keep up with it. Thankfully it is simple to adjust the tension (instructions are in the setup manual). The 12.5% incline is not adjustable, but I find that to be a bonus - this is a great addition to my C25K workout, and if I can't go outside and run I can at least know that I'm working a bit harder with the incline.\n\nAmenities - It domes with a little tray that shows basic info (calories burned, time, speed, distance, etc...) and has a hole that the included sports bottle fits in and a shallow, oval cup inset. I found that the cup is too shallow and narrow for my smartphone to securely rest in (Samsung Galaxy S5), but it's a great place to store a small mp3 player or a hand towel to dry off that sweat!\n\nMobility - I don't even bother folding mine up to stash it in between uses, although I would if I had company coming over. It's light to move and I just move it out of the way in between uses. I like to use it in front of the TV so it's become a fixture in my living room. I have not tried folding it up, but it looks simple enough to do - Just unscrew a knob on each side near the floor (don't lose the nuts!) and pull a little pin towards the top and fold! Replace the nuts and knobs and store it.\n\nIt is recommended to use this with a mat underneath, and if you care about your carpet or floor I would second that recommendation. Unfortunately my carpet is already ruined from years of pet ownership, so I don't bother. I will be getting a mat whenever I replace my carpet with tile.\n\nIf you want a treadmill that you can run and walk in with adjustable incline settings, then prepare to spend a few hundred more bucks or get a gym membership (planet fitness is decent and cheap). If you just want something to enable you to do some walking at home in front of the TV, then this is great, and it's hard to beat the cost!;Great for some basic walking at home!
101;49.0;3.0;13.0;The unit was easy to set up. The exercise routine is much more strenuous than walking on a motorized Treadmill. I was able to walk at a good pace on a motorized unit for an hour but I am working slowly up to a half hour on the this unit. I do feel once I get my stamina up that the workout will be a substantial one and get me ready for hiking in the Springtime. I did have to lessen the incline in order to get into a smooth pace. I will slowly increase the incline as I get stronger.;It is a workout
34;50.0;4.0;10.0;I've had this treadmill for around a year now and it's still holding strong.\n\nSo some background info here, I was looking for a treadmill that would be able to handle some actual running. Not full blown marathon sessions, but enough to break a sweat when I couldn't run outside due to rain or snow. I also wasn't looking to break the bank on a motorized treadmill that doesn't even have a motor that can go above 10mph! So this treadmill has been great so far. I'm around 160lbs and am able to run without damaging this treadmill. Since it's self powered, I can sprint if I want without limitations due to a motor. Again though, this is under moderate usage, and not every day. Since it wasn't meant for running there are some limitations such as the speed gauges. They kind of stop measuring at around 4-5 mph so you won't get accuracy for speed, calorie count, etc..., but I only care about the time which is obviously fine. This is self powered and the belt motion does take some getting used to. Also, I am mindful of just how hard I slam my feet down onto the track as I don't want to break it.\n\nSo that's pretty much it, I couldn't find any treadmills rated for running that weren't $1000 or over, so I took a chance on this one and it works!;I was looking for a treadmill to RUN on. (I'm 160 lbs)
41;51.0;5.0;10.0;I recently purchased this product and to be honest I was very skeptical about it. I looked at many other treadmills before buying this one and I also read the reviews especially the negative ones. I saw a few negatives that said not to buy it because it was a piece of junk. Let me tell you they were probably haters or couldn't even last on the treadmill.\nWhen I first received my treadmill the box look a little bad and thought the worst! But when I opened the box everything was nicely placed I made sure nothing was missing. I right away read the manual and assembled the treadmill, it was very easy! took me 30 minutes to do it myself! Everything was nicely and in perfect condition!\nI'm also a college student 18 years, 6'3 tall and 225 pounds. I'm a bodybuilder and I needed this to do my daily morning cardio especially during my cutting season, I seriously though this thing wasn't going to hold my weight or even be able to run, but it did! You can actually run on it. But hold the handles or you'll fall lol but it's not bad. This is definitely different from a motorized treadmill and more challenging I was breaking in sweat in just 5 minutes! I really loved this product it is actually the first time I purchase something expensive in amazon, this was a great investment! I'll post a review later on to keep it updated to see how things turn out=);Was very Impressed!!
51;52.0;1.0;10.0;"My husband bought me this treadmill as an early Christmas present and I had such high hopes for it. I am so disappointed!! We've had the treadmill for about 5 days now and I am ready to throw it out the window. Here are my biggest complaints.\n1. It is flimsy. I am average/slightly heavy in size and I feel like the thing is not strong enough to support me.\n2. The track will not glide smoothly. We have tried all the other reviewers suggestions on applying some lube to help in glide more smoothly, but that only lasts for about 10-15 and then it starts jerking and sticking again. I shouldn't have to keep a bottle of WD-40 next to me as I walk.\n3. The incline is much steeper than you think. When I first looked at the incline I thought ""Oh, that's not too bad."" However, once I actually started to try and walk on it I realized it was killing my knees. The incline wouldn't be as bad if you weren't trying to keep the track moving and hold on to the (very small) handles for dear life in fear of being thrown off the darn thing.\n4. I have to fiercly grip the handles just to stay on the track, otherwise you fall off due to the jerky movement of the track. I hate this because I want to be able to swing my arms and use hand weights.\n5. The track itself is not very long. I feel like I am going to fall off the back of it (which I already have once.)\n\nHonestly, I think you just get what you pay for. We were trying to save money and not spend several hundred dollars on a motorized treadmill, but in the end it was not worth it. I now have to deal with packaging it back up and getting it shipped back out. I am going to take my $150 and put it aside and save up for a motorized one that will give me more options....and not kill me.";Hate it! Returning today!
58;53.0;4.0;10.0;I used to be a pretty serious runner until experiencing a back injury several months ago. I needed to start walking as part of my rehab but being mid November it's much too dark, wet, and cold to walk outside. I wanted a treadmill that would be quiet and easy to store in my small apartment. I also needed it to be light enough for me to move around and store by myself with a bad back. This treadmill fits the bill exactly. No, it doesn't feel like the treadmills I'm used to at the gym, as a matter of fact it feels just like walking outside, which in my opinion is more helpful for my back and also gives me a better workout.\n\nThe reason I only gave it four stars:\n\n1) It came a bit scuffed up\n2) It was more difficult to put together than it should have been because the pieces didn't fit easily together and had to be adjusted or forced\n3) The belt is awfully narrow and took a bit of getting used to\n4) The belt goes so fast at its designed incline that I kept almost faceplanting, then suddenly the belt would halt and I'd almost fall backward. I resolved this by stacking magazines under the back end. It took a bit of practice but now I can walk smoothly and I didn't even need to lubricate the belt.;Just what I needed!
99;54.0;1.0;11.0;"Walking outside sets my allergies off, so I wanted to walk inside. I wrongly thought a manual treadmill would be beneficial.  HA! It's nearly impossible to get a walking rhythm on this. It's like stuttering with my feet. I could easily walk 5 miles in high heels around my neighborhood, but this thing wears me out in 5 minutes. Within the first week of using it, I developed a pain in my left leg that may or may not be related to the treadmill (I have RA). But when this pain is present, it's all that more difficult to get the treadmill moving at a worthwhile pace. I am really sorry I bought this. I should have tested some store models out first.\n\nThe info also leads one to believe that this ""collapsible"" treadmill can actually be stored somewhere. Even collapsed, it's still too big to put under most beds.";Can't believe Denise Austin lent her name this
19;55.0;4.0;8.0;"First off, there is free shipping with this product. It ships from California and it took about 5 business days to get here (during the Christmas Season). It got here as expected, and no issues found with the shipment.\n\nIt is pretty easy to set up. It took me about 20 minutes. I was able to do it myself, but two people would be helpful but not necessarily needed. Please have a electric screwdriver handy as this will expedite putting it together and saving your hands from twisting the screws. There was one bolt that would not screw in. Spent five minutes on that one alone until I got the electric screwdriver.\n\nThere is a learning curve when walking on this. If you have been used to a motorized treadmill like I was, this is so different. One you will notice that you will poop out quicker. This is using your own body to move the tread. It also took me about an hour of walking on it to get the pace down where it wasn't so hard.\n\nIt is lifted in the front, so you are walking up hill. You can put a phone book in the back in order to make it easier if you prefer.\n\nThe display is basic, but it get the job done.\n\nYes, you will have to hold on to the rails and running would be hard. It is designed for walking people. If you want to run on it, I would look elsewhere. The belt is narrow, but this is not a problem for me. Please take a look at the specifications BEFORE ordering. There are some negative reviews due to the belt size. The specs lay everything out.\n\nI gave this a four star because it is slightly wobbly. Not a huge deal and should not be a deal breaker. Once you learn how to walk on it, it because less wobbly . I would highly recommend this.\n\nUpdated 12/29/2013\n\nThis think isn't as wobbly as originally thought IF you put the two ""wheel thingies"" on after it is folded down. Duh. This stabilizes it quite a bit. After using it some more., I would say the disadvantage is if you are really tall. Would be hard to hold onto. I am still liking this alot and glad I didn't spend a lot of money on a different treadmill.";Great Treadmill for the money
13;56.0;4.0;7.0;I received my treadmill this week and I have to say I've been pleasantly surprise! I was skeptical about the whole manual thing since I've always used the electric kind at gyms but I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars so after reading reviews I went with this one. It took me less than an hour to put it together, directions were clear and concise and although you do have to hold on to the bars due to the natural incline, the pros outweigh the cons without a doubt. I was surprised at the workout I got from this thing! I worked up a sweat in no time! I couldn't be happier with my purchase and I highly recommend this treadmill.;The little treadmill that could!
23;57.0;3.0;8.0;I ordered this treadmill to use for fast walking and light jogging at home.  I was very pleased with the price and the relative ease of setup (with some extra elbow grease for certain screws).  The profile is small and I appreciate that it doesn't need to be plugged in.\n\nI agree with other reviewers who indicate that you must hold onto the handles and walk with a fluid motion in order to make it work.  If you try to run the tread speeds up way too fast, and you lose control.  Hanging on I have found that I can walk at a fast walk/gentle jog.\n\nI also agree that the incline, which is unchangeable, makes walking on the treadmill more of a workout than you would suspect.  This is not the treadmill for someone recovering from an injury or hoping for the option for a leisurely workout once in awhile.  I am (relatively) young and (relatively) thin, but I get tired on this machine more easily than on the treadmills at the gym.\n\nI don't regret the purchase yet (it's been about a month) but I do wish it was possible to walk slowly OR to run quickly on this - neither is very easy.;Not exactly a walk in the park
14;58.0;5.0;7.0;I run on this thing everyday for 30 minutes for the past 3 months. Amazing deal and stands up to the abuse. At first it can be hard to balance and run to power the treadmill instead of an electric one. However I got used to it quickly and I enjoy this over large bulky electric ones now.;Avid runner, stands up to the abuse

90;60.0;4.0;10.0;There are several thing I like about this treadmill.  I like the price, its fairly cheap and was well within my budget at the time I was shopping for one.  I like that its relatively small.  It is not huge and bulky and  it folds up nicely so that I can put it behind the closet door when not in use.  Its a huge plus that its not so heavy that I can actually move it from behind the closet door to the living room and black again when I'm done by myself.  It was easy to put together right out of the box and took me almost no time at all.  I really like how I control the speed, not some computer.  However, if you crave something advanced then this is not the treadmill for you.;Great for the price!
38;61.0;1.0;8.0;I like being a good patient and get my annual physicals.  Usually, my doctor says my numbers (sugar, HDL, LDL) are fine, keep up the good work. After my last physical, my doctor said he noticed I put on a few pounds (about 7 lbs) and my numbers are a bit on the high side. His suggestion was to lose the weight and my numbers should be fine again.\n\nI like the idea of walking to stay fit.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a fancy treadmill and really don't have the room for one.  Upon looking at the Phoenix Manual Treadmill on Amazon, I thought this might be the solution.  I pictured myself walking on this treadmill 30 minutes a day and losing the extra weight, but now realize this machine isn't the solution for me.\n\nPackaging and Set-up\n--------------------\nAfter ordering, the treadmill took about a week to arrive.  It was securely packaged with plenty of styrofoam for protection. The set-up directions are pretty straight forward and it took me about an hour to set up.  I did have one problem in that the wiring for the LCD display (which shows the speed, distance and such) was defective.  I called the manufacturer and he agreed to ship replacement wires (which should arrive in a few days).\n\nMy First Work Out\n-----------------\nSince the LCD display didn't work, I just used a stopwatch to time my first workout.  The belt moves smoothly with no shifting to the side.  The treadmill has about a 10 degree fixed incline.  Because of the incline and it being manual, while walking one has to grab onto to hand tubing or handle bar to keep your balance.  I walked on the treadmill for about 5 minutes.  After this, my heart was pounding and I worked up a good sweat.  The workout sure was robust, but perhaps a little too much.\n\nMy Next Work Out The Next Day\n-----------------------------\nI think the incline is causing the hard work so (as other reviewers have done) I put a piece of 2 x 4 wood underneath the back to decrease the incline.  Now the incline was closer to 5 degrees.  I tried to walk for 30 minutes, but after 20 I started to feel faint and had to stop. In addition, a big problem with this machine (and manual treadmills) is that while walking, I had to hang on to the tubing or handlebars the entire time which got uncomfortable for my arms.\n\nThe machine does give an intense workout.  Perhaps a bit too intense.  That evening, not only did I have the natural soreness on my legs (which is understandable) but one of my achilles started to hurt (which is not good) and\nI had pain in one of my knees.\n\nAfter my second workout, I found myself having buyer's remorse and wishing I had bought a motorized treadmill instead. With a motorized treadmill, that should allow me to walk naturally and not hang on to keep my balance like I'm using a grab bar when getting out of a slippery shower.\n\nLikes:\n-----\n- good price\n\n- easy to set up\n\n- small footprint\n\n- foldable\n\n- intense, robust workout possible\n\n- lightweight, only about 50 lbs\n\nDislikes:\n--------\n- can't move arms freely while walking, have to hold on to keep balance\n\n- difficult to walk in slow pace ( slow walking causes treadmill to stop), which may leads to too intense workouts\n\n- fixed incline setting, not adjustable\n\n- wiring defective for one I received\n\n- securing knobs when folded cumbersome to use. (When folded, there is a security pin. But the pin is too short of hold the platform securely in place.  So one needs to use two screw in knobs, but they do not screw in easily without bumping against the side frame)\n\nIn conclusion, I can see that this treadmill would work if you like a short but intense workout and don't mind having your hands not free as you need to holding on to keep your balance. But workouts more than about 5 minutes can get uncomfortable mainly due to the need to to keep your balance.  Also, longer workouts may put possible wear on the body.\n\nFor my cardio exercise, I'll look for another solution. Currently, I'll stick to my stationary bicycle and in the future perhaps look into a compact motorized treadmill which allows me to move my arms naturally while walking.\n\nAn exercise machine should adapt to your body, and not the other way around.;Phoenix Manual Treadmill - Is This a Robust Exerciser or Torture Apparatus?
78;62.0;5.0;9.0;"I would SO MUCH rather have a manual treadmill than an electric one!  I use an electric one at the gym, and it's just doing most of the work for me.  My Phoenix 98510 Easy-Up gives me a much more thorough workout, because I am the one propelling it. . .and always at an uphill slant, no less!  I have had it for over a year now, and we are going strong.  My workout time and endurance has certainly increased, but I feel no need to extend my sessions to more than 20 minutes at a time.  Continuing to work out above and beyond your target heart rate just isn't productive.\n\nThe motion is smooth and non-jerky.  You just step on it and start gliding right along!  You can go at any pace you like.  Of course, you always need to hold onto the handles due to the basic nature of a manual treadmill, but that's no big deal.\n\nThe little monitor isn't much to speak of. . .I don't think it's very accurate.  But I use my own Polar heart rate monitor/calorie counter watch to track my workouts anyway.  So I don't care about that.\n\nThe set-up is simple.  Just lay everything out and follow the instructions.  My son put mine together without any problems in less than an hour.  It is completely stable with very solid and sturdy construction.  There is no concern whatsoever of it tipping or giving way or anything like that.\n\nIt takes up very little space but is totally roomy enough for anyone to use without feeling the least bit cramped.  I am 137lb and 5'6"" tall.  My husband is 250lb and 5'6"" tall.  We both use it with equal comfort.  He has had bilateral knee surgeries, and it doesn't bother him.\n\nYou can easily move it anywhere with one hand.  You can also fold it up to the size of a step-ladder, if you like.  It is really quiet when operating, too.  I usually exercise at home in my living room while everyone is watching TV, and there aren't any problems hearing anything.  I have yet to need to apply any kind of lubricant under the belt.  So far, it has been totally maintenance-free.  I love it!!!";A FABULOUS treadmill for your home gym.
79;63.0;1.0;9.0;in concept this is a very good product, but it falls a bit short. 1. I would like to be able to lower or adjust the incline. 2.  it would be nice if the tread moved more freely.  The price is good;could be better
43;64.0;3.0;8.0;Easy to setup. Fairly sturdy. You do have to hold on to make sure to keep your balance on this manual treadmill--but that is probably for all types since you do have to expend effort to get it moving.\n\nBiggest drawback is that you can't use it for running. The computer can't register speeds above 3.4mph, so if you are a fast walker, you are out of luck. You can't really use it for running, because there's no spring to absorb the shock--your feet will push the belt onto the base and it cause it to move rather jerky than smoothly, and you don't want that if you're trying to run.\n\nGood for the price if you are just going to walk, but if you need more, better search elsewhere.;Great for walking--not for running
83;65.0;4.0;9.0;I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and degenerative disease in by hips. Walking helps, but no side walks where I live. Uneven surfaces. My Dr. said no electric treadmill as my bones could not stand a break if I fell. This treadmill is perfect for me.;Good Deal

22;67.0;2.0;7.0;So, I ended up returning this item. It wasn't a horrible product for the first few days, just wasn't for me.\n\nPros:::\n+So this thing is pretty compact. The room I set it up in isn't to big and when I finally got it assembled, it doesn't take up much space at all. Folded up I almost was able to fit it into the closet and moving it from room to room was pretty easy.\n+Light weight. Very easy to move, easy to maneuver\n+Easy set-up. Didn't take me long at all to assemble. Had it working before an episode of Dexter ended.\n\nCons:::\n-So, the belt started sticking to the surface pretty much by the end of the next day. I used some of the lubricant that was recommended to get it going again, but it just started sticking again after an hour. I read that some other people were experiencing this, doesn't seem to be happen to every machine, but it was really frustrating having the random skip while trying to walk on it.\n-Felt flimsy. The rails didn't feel very solid at all. But, I guess I got what I paid for. But man, those things would shake, tilt, and just not really want to stay solid. Didn't make using the machine very comfortable.\n-Just enjoyable overall. The overall experience of using this machine wasn't really something I would like to repeat.\n\nOverall:::\nThe sticking made using the machine unbearable. I returned it, bought one with a motor, and am much happier with my new buy. Sure, its huge and takes more room and I can't move it from place to place, but the new treadmill doesn't feel flimsy like this one and is more enjoyable to use. If you're looking to save a buck, skip this. Just buy a cheap motorized one.;Not for everyone
11;68.0;1.0;6.0;"Assembly was easy until I got to part 32 named Front Support. The width of the support was a full .25"" or more shorter than the span of the base to which it attached; even when parts 17 & 18 were fully tightened. I could have bent the support to fit the base, but in my opinion the factory should make sure that I don't have to modify parts. At this point the product was disassembled and repackaged. No stars.\n\nP.S. This got one star because it was required. For this type of mess, I would give it negative stars. Now there's the inconvenience of returning said product.";Buy at your own risk.
91;69.0;4.0;9.0;The Phoenix Denise Austin 98510 Easy-Up Manual Treadmill is a great product for the price for basic walking needs.  Jogging/running is possible but you definitely need to hold on to the rails.  I average 3.0 mph walking, and it is quiet flawless in its operation.  It was also very easy to put together.  Also, be sure to read the entire manual, especially the part about the belt adjustment.\n\nFor some, finding the right balance may take some getting used to because of the incline, but overall it suited our needs very well.;Excellent treadmill for basic walking needs
30;70.0;5.0;7.0;"Less than $120, it is a great bargain for me.  During inclement weather, I can't get outside to walk.  At age 74 and with recent back surgery, I need at least two mile each day.  With this, I can watch my favorite programs and still get in my 2M per day.  The handholds are sturdy and help me to steady myself...I am still ""wobbly"" because my muscles had atrophied so much during the two years of holding off surgery.  It is also easy to set up and take down.  It probably would not be fast enough for someone in shape and used to running, but it is great for this elderly person.  I am most pleased with this Treadmill and would recommend it to others.  Ye Olde Road Warrior";Phoenix 98510 Easy-Up Manual Treadmill
31;71.0;1.0;7.0;I was very disappointed by this treadmill. I'm not a tall person but I did expect it to be long enough to handle a running stride... I was wrong. I could barely walk on it without it trying to throw me off the whole thing. I tried to return it but couldn't repack it in time and now I'm stuck with it.;Not what I expected
104;72.0;5.0;9.0;I bought this manual treadmill as an inexpensive alternative to a motorized treadmill, and it works fine and helps me burn lots of calories. Even though it is compact in size but very stable when you walk or run on the machine. Light weight, easy to move or storage. The machine really worth the buck.;Excellent Treadmill!
32;73.0;1.0;7.0;I was so excited by the price, but I got it the treadmill track was broken. It would turn a few times when I walked on it and then it would abruptly stop. We tried loosening the bolts, using wd40 and nothing worked. It was dangerous because of how abruptly it would stop, you could certainly injure yourself. I returned it but it was a huge pain in the butt.;Broken from the start
47;74.0;3.0;7.0;First I'll start by saying that I like this treadmill.  It does exactly as advertised and is nice and quiet.\n\nSecond, what a nightmare it was to put together.  What should have taken 10 minutes, took over an hour.  The hole on the right side arm was bent in.  We thought of just returning it, but we had waited over a week to get it.  So my husband spent 15 minutes with a wrench and a file trying to open up the whole so we could insert the top bar.  We were finally able to do that and started putting together the tread section with the bottom of the frame, when of course, another hole issue.  This hole was not big enough for the small projecting thread, that stuck out of the tread section, to fit through the hole.  So more filing and this time some hammering.  It was just silly.  But determination won out.  Once the treadmill was put together, it was great.  But to send out a product like that, was just ridiculous.  We are now worried how long this will actually last, considering what we dealt with in the beginning.\n\nBut like I said, the treadmill works well and is nice and quiet.  It's definitely not for running, but I'm hoping it lasts a few years.;Would have been 4 stars if the metal had not been bent
86;75.0;5.0;8.0;I spent about 2 weeks searching the internet for the perfect manual treadmill. I read reviews & kinda felt like I took a chance buying any manual treadmill over the internet. I have been using it for about a month & I AM SOOOO HAPPY WITH IT!! I have always been a fan of Denise Austin & I knew she would never endorse a product if she didn't like it. I am glad I went with my gut instinct & bought this one. The price was wonderful & woaahhhh what a workout. I did the math & I believe it is a 6% incline. I walk a mile & am sweating like crazy. Sounds gross, right, but I know it gave me a great cardio workout. Buy this one if you are going to get any off the internet. Oh yeah, putting it together was easy too. HaPpY WoRkiNg oUt!! :)\n\nUPDATE: Still using it 6 years plus !;Perfect in every way!!!
16;76.0;5.0;6.0;"I needed a treadmill that did not take up a lot of space.  This unit is 4 feet high, 4 feet long and 22 inches wide which is perfect for the room I have it in.  The room is also unheated and that is why I choose a manual treadmill.  I have burned out motors on 2 motorized ones due to their having to work too hard in unheated conditions.  As others have stated, you cannot adjust the degree of incline which does give you quite a workout. However, I am a 70 year old woman and I can manage it!  As others have stated, I just shortened my time at first and gradually worked up to the level of time I wanted. One advantage of a manual treadmill is that I do not worry if my grandchildren romp on it.  There is no way for them to get hurt and it helps use up ""little boy energy.""  The unit is well constructed.  Assembly was not difficult for my husband.  We did need to adjust the belt once due to it ""walking"" but instructions are in the manual for adjustment.  There is a monitor on it which is an added advantage.  The monitor tracks the speed, distance, time.  There is no way for it to monitor heart rate, pulse, etc that the motorized ones do.  Setting it is easy.  Just hold the button down until it resets itself.  That part is battery operated so in time a battery will need to be replaced. This unit has saved me from winter weight gain and this winter has been terrible!  I love this treadmill!";Quite effective small unit.
17;77.0;4.0;6.0;I have a nice backroom exercise area and bought this as it is self-propelled.  I've used the mechanical ones in the past and found either I don't work hard enough at it to break out in a sweat, or they weigh so much from the computer guts that I need help if I want to get it out of the way.  This one is a nice go-between.  It doesn't have all the fancy digital gadgets or things people prefer to break up the boredom of a treadmill walk, but I generally watch a movie instead.  It does have a water bottle holder, but it could hold a glass of water or tea as well.  It is easy to get going, but not too easy where you would fall on your face and chip a tooth.  It requires some effort to keep it going too, so you do sweat (what a novelty).  There is an uphill adjustment that works simply with the twist of a knob.  Really, for a no-nonsense treadmill without all the bells and whistles it's great.  If you're not looking for the fans, book holders, heart rate thumb grips, etc., and you just wanna walk--then this is perfect.  Otherwise, you might want a higher-end luxury model that wipes the fake sweat from your forehead as well.  I would highly recommend this product.;Simple, safe, and small enough to move.
55;78.0;5.0;7.0;I was a little skeptical about getting this treadmill but I definitely do not regret getting it. First of, the packaging was good and everything was there. Installation was not very difficult, just took a little time to understand exactly what the manual was saying. You are going to need someone to help you. Put it together, and tested it. The electronic display did not work properly but that was because I missed a connection that I found the day after and it worked. I got the treadmill about 1 week ago and its been working great still. I have no complaints whatsoever. It is an excellent exercise machine and it is more of a workout that I expected. I used to go walking on mornings before but couldn't keep it up. I would walk for about 1 hr, non stop. 15 minutes on this treadmill and I have to take a break. The fact that you have to power the treadmill does make it more of a workout than if it was automated. Its also easy to move around and doesn't take up much space.\n\nI would recommend this machine to anyone. Never mind any negative reviews. Go for it. You won't regret it.;Excellent Treadmill
18;79.0;5.0;6.0;"So you get what you pay for, plain and simple.  I am an average size female, 5'5"", 135-140 lbs, and I love this treadmill for the winter months.  I have used it 4 times a week for the past 2-3 months and it has held up well.  It's light enough that when it arrived, I was able to get it up 2 flights of stairs all by myself (with a bit of muscle, I promise you can do it)... I put it together all by myself, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out.  Yeah, one of the pieces was not fitting properly but it is cheap... what do you expect?? I pushed and leaned on it until it was the correct shape to fit into place and viola, all was well.  It does have an incline, so you do have to hold on or you'll go flying back because it is well greased upon arrival.  I really don't mind it.  It does it's job, folds up and has a locking latch, so I love it.  Also, I have yet to experience issues with the track slipping or noises or any of that, so I'm not sure if maybe the people who made those comments just didn't put something together right or what, but yeah... It's awesome for the price.";awesome for the price
21;80.0;3.0;6.0;"The setup was pretty easy; I weigh 220 lbs and if I'm not focused on my stride then I get tripped up a little.  I was able to use it continuously while watching the Daily Show and I definitely felt it afterwards.  I'd also recommend it for someone shorter than me, I'm 5'11"", the sweet spot is someone who is probably 5'2"" - 5'7"".  The verdict is still out, but don't expect this to be a great substitute to one you might find at a gym.";Decent manual, not great for 200lbs +
76;81.0;4.0;7.0;We needed a tredmill that would be safe for our Grand children to walk on, this turned out to be the right one for all three grands.  It moved at their pace because there was no power, they had to be the power sourse. Now when it's raining or snowing outside the kids can get the exercise they need without tearing up the house.\n\nHappy GrandDad.;For My Grands
33;82.0;1.0;6.0;I wanted a basic manual treadmill to use on rainy days and when the schedule was too busy for the gym. The treadmill arrived quickly and the frame seemed sturdy. I was thrilled until I went to put in the last bolt. The receiving hole in the frame was incorrectly sized. I didn't want to use a different bolt because it was a major piece. Had to take it all apart and send back. Thankfully, Amazon was awesome as usual and paid for the return shipping because the item was defective.;Disappointed
36;83.0;5.0;6.0;I bought this treadmill almost a month ago and couldn't be happier. There were mixed reviews online but this is my experience with this item. It shipped quickly, I got it like 2 days later. Some reviews said it either was impossible to put together or it took 30 minutes... it took me an hour. If your not use to putting together furniture allow yourself extra time or get someone to help you. I read that that noise was a concern for some, I am on the 2nd floor of my apartment complex and never did I feel I was being disruptive to my neighbors. I am a single working mom so money is always an issue, and this is the best $150 I spent on myself.;Great for the price
82;84.0;5.0;7.0;"Instructions were clear, and assembly was easy. Included ""tool"" was adequate enough for job.\nWe were looking for a simple, ""no frills"" machine, and this is it!\nTakes up little space, stores easily.\nEven our daughter uses it, the cat not so much.";Met expectation, easy assembly
85;85.0;4.0;7.0;Nice treadmill for the money...but a word here...BUY THE SILICONE SPRAY.  This rides at a bit more of an incline that I would like it to, but MAN.  Do you get a workout on this thing!  By the time you've gone a half a mile on this, it would be like a mile on a regular walk, and does not take long to break a sweat! It is NOT, however, a treadmill for running or for someone with balance issues. Assembly is VERY easy, and with the easy-up feature for the belt base, it stores nicely.  The pin that locks it in place for storage has a potential to slip, so be sure that it isn't stored in a high traffic area, or where small children could bump the machine and dislodge the belt base.;Manual Treadmill
40;86.0;4.0;6.0;Giving it 4 stars overall because it does what it is suppose to do which is a walking treadmill.  The first time I went to fold up the treadmill, the wiring got caught in between the up right bar and it broke.  The wiring is for the device that tracks your speed, time, distance, etc while you exercise.  Now it doesn't work without the wiring.....not a big deal.  The tread is a bit narrower than what you would find on a standard treadmill so you have to pay extra attention on where you step.  It does give you a good workout for walking since it does have a slight incline on it.  Nice for the calfs :)\n\nOverall, it is a good machine.  The one thing which is a bit getting used to is the handle bars tend to move.  Might be due to the narrow base when walking.;Overall a good product and not much to complain about
42;87.0;5.0;6.0;"My perferred form of exercise is walking, not running. So my household did not need those super expensive machines you see in spas or gyms. This treadmill is perfect for my needs as well as those of my father who is diabetic. Since you ""power"" the treadmill by simply walking, there is little risk of an accident. It will only go as fast or slow as you walk. Though it is not as sophisticated as those costing 10x more, if all you need is a basic walking machine that measures the time, speed, and calories burned, this is for you. It is well worth the money.";Perfect for basic needs
88;88.0;3.0;7.0;After reading reviews for this model and several others I chose this one. The old adage you get what you pay for is so true. It was fairly easy to assemble,seems sturdy but even after lubricating as directed-it sticks about every 5th stride and begins to squeak after a few minutes. Very frustrating and as I am not in a location to re-join a gymn this and my cardio-ride will have to do. For anyone looking for a smooth quiet walking experience-look else where;so so
50;89.0;5.0;6.0;"I have had my treadmill for about 10 days. It is working very well and I have learned to use it just fine. It was a little difficult at first attempt to get it moving but now I just step on and off I go. I am a tall woman (5'8"") and I have no problem with the size of the treadmill. It was easy to assemble, my husband did it in just a few minutes. I haven't folded it to tuck away yet but will during the day on Christmas.  I am so glad I bought this treadmill, the cost, the size and the noise level are all huge pluses. I hope it continues to be just what I wanted.";So far it is wonderful
93;90.0;4.0;7.0;This works as a manual treadmill, but it is cheaply constructed. Some of the screws don't fit right. I found my own. Remember the weight limit is 250. This thing is good for walking and jogging, not running.;works decently (but cheaply made)
57;91.0;5.0;6.0;"I had reservations about purchasing a manual treadmill despite the good reviews on this page. In the end, I am so glad that I decided to buy it. It was incredibly simple to put together (alone) with the included tools. The treadmill itself is light enough to move around with ease.\n\nUse: You need a minimal amount of coordination to make it work. I recommend holding onto the hand rails, otherwise you could end up on your butt (or worse, injure your knees). It stops when you stop; it goes when you go. I weight 160 pounds and had no issues with either walking or running on it.\n\nConclusion: I highly recommend this treadmill for anyone looking to start working on their fitness. The up-hill motion gives you a little extra bit of work to do, so that's a plus!";So glad I bought this!
97;92.0;4.0;7.0;I received this item in a timely manner and assembled it quickly.  The machine is satisfactory but the no motor treadmill takes some getting used to.  Initially, my gait was erratic but with experience, it's smoother.;good for winter
69;93.0;2.0;6.0;This is for really small people. I am not overweight, but if I was, I would not be able to use this treadmill at all. To be honest, I am still trying to figure out if it will really work for me.... The tread-y part is narrow and short, so it feels a bit awkward. I am 5'11, and I can't imagine someone any taller using this thing either. Iffy guys, iffy.;This is for tiny people.
20;94.0;4.0;5.0;"I am usually a huge critic, but I'm not going to sit here and be all nit picky. It's a manual treadmill and you get what you pay for. I keep reading reviews about how "" flimsy"" it is. I have to disagree. This thing is solid and sturdy. I'm 5'2"" weighing a hefty 196 lbs and I'm not at all concerned about it breaking. My only complaint is that it's a little hard to walk on it. The belt is hard to get going and I wish it had multiple angle options but it does not. Aside from that it works as expected. My husband who is 6'2"" even walks on it. I would definitely recommend this if you want a good workout, but are on a budget.";An honest review!
24;95.0;1.0;5.0;Disappointed.  His product does not run smoothly like was promised.  Not enough length or width to achieve a good workout.;Treadmill disappointment
77;96.0;4.0;6.0;"Treadmill was easy to setup with all parts included.\n\nMy only issue is that the belt once ""walked"" a bit to the right from stepping too hard on the right side of the belt, but just by stepping hard on the left side I was able to walk it back to the center within a few steps. Plus it would be nicer to have the handle bars higher up for taller people.\n\nAs far as the work out, it's really nice for being stuck inside during the winter as I usually walk a lot around my neighborhood otherwise. Takes a few minutes to get use to pushing the belt manually, and as others have said, do get the oil and put it on right away as it's smoother. It seems like it will last for some time. No regrets buying this over some huge, expensive, electric treadmill and it's easy to move around or even put away. VERY pleased for the $$$.\n\nUPDATE: December, 2014 - This treadmill is still a great buy! I use it on a regular basis and it's good work out. Can't beat the value of this. I have not had any more issues with the belt walking from one side to another.";What a deal and great for winter being stuck inside
27;97.0;5.0;5.0;I've wanted a treadmill for a while but I live alone and only weigh 120 lbs, so I was worried about assembling it, moving it, and just being able to bring the box inside! The motorized ones weigh around 300 lbs. I really didn't want to spend a lot of money and have a giant contraption around either. I brought the box in myself, opened it easily and had it assembled in 15 minutes. It comes with little tools, but I found that using a real screwdriver was easier. The footprint is tiny but it's a great workout. I use it in front of the TV. If someone comes over, I can fold it up and wheel it into a closet. The computer definitely doesn't work. The numbers change constantly and mean nothing. I don't care about it since I go by the clock on the wall and walk as fast as I can. Bottom line, I like it. One more thing, it feels like it works my glutes a lot more than regular walking or using a motorized treadmill.;fun!
28;98.0;4.0;5.0;"Pros: Less expensive, small footprint, portable, forces a good workout assuming you have the will power to walk/run faster\n\nCons: more noisy than you'd expect, needs a bit more maintenance because of the extra lubrication required, requires more will power to do interval training because the machine won't force you to run faster (some might find this as a pro)\n\nGet some silicone based lubricant.

45;102.0;5.0;5.0;Ive had the treadmill for about a month and I love it. It works great. I like the idea that unlike a motorized one that I use to have, there is almost no noise when using it. Room is an issue so its a perfect size. But regardless of the size, even if I had the room, I would prefer this one over a larger motorized one. The incline was a little to much so I raised the back end up about an inch and its perfect. I would definitely recommend it - Reuven;I love it
46;103.0;4.0;5.0;I have to be honest I was not expecting much when my wife asked me to order this treadmill. We live on the top floor of an apartment complex and were looking for something to give us a little exercise when the winter weather did not permits is to walk outside. A full sized treadmill wouldn't work because the the sound and vibrations would certainly bother our neighbors. So I decided to give this manual treadmill a shot.\n\nSo far we are pleasantly surprised at how well this treadmill works. The build quality is quite good for a product that costs under 150 dollars and once the treadmill was completely set up it really felt sturdy. It is also very quiet and outside of our footfalls on the belt it hardly makes any noise. It took one person about 30 minutes to assemble.\n\nA manual treadmill does take some getting used to though. It is set on an incline to make moving the belt easier but that incline also provides a pretty good workout. It is like constantly walking up hill.\n\nSo far I am quite satisfied with my purchase. I have only had the treadmill for a few days so if anything changes I will be sure to update my review.;Pleasantly Surprised
102;104.0;2.0;6.0;The correct size screws were not included and the manual was not easy to read. I received it about 4 days ago and still have not been able to put it together because I have to go to a store that sells the screws that the seller did not submit.;Not all assembly equipment included
54;105.0;3.0;5.0;I took a chance on this one, but it didn't work out. I wanted to love it, because of the price, but it is just too hard to use. As a lover of motorized treadmills, I thought this could work, but nope. There is no way to use it without holding on to the handles. Forget a nice stroll -- you will be out of breath.***EDIT 29 May 2013 - We put it out on the street a few nights ago along with the instruction manual, someone picked it up, perhaps for scrap metal.;I love treadmills but...
67;106.0;4.0;5.0;I was looking for a smallish inexpensive treadmill that would fit in the bedroom and not take up a lot of space.  After reading Amazon's reviews, I purchased this Phoenix Easy-Up.  When it arrived it was fairly easy to assemble, although for some reason the manufacturer didn't secure the wires for the display so as to prevent them from retreating deep inside the support tube, which required me to fish them out of the tube.  That was not very easy.  Except for that, assembling it was pretty easy and I had it all done within 30 minutes.\n\nI didn't have to align the belt like some have needed to.  The instructions do tell you how to align it if needed.  I also haven't found it necessary to lubricate it to make it run smoothly.  The built in incline is necessary for operation because your feet must do the work of pushing the belt down the incline while walking.  I didn't find it very difficult at all for walking.\n\nThe belt width is wide enough for me to use.  I was concerned since it's more narrow than most.  It would be nice if the unit had a more versatile holder on the handle bars so you could put the TV remote controll in it, but my wife found a was around that by installing a fabric mesh bag in the hole for the drinking bottle (which we don't use).\n\nI'm very satisfied with the treadmill, considering the price, it does it's job well.  It folds up into a very small space very easily, although the spring-loaded pin that holds it up is not very secure and can release the floorboard if a little pressure is applied.\n\nOverall I'm very happy with it and pleased it gives me a workout yet can be folded up and out of the way easily when not in use.;Decent treadmill
80;107.0;4.0;5.0;I purchased this treadmill as a backup. It's not fancy but I get a good cardio workout on it. My other treadmill is a Treadclimber, which I, of course, like much better. However, this one was about one-tenth of the cost and fulfills its job requirements. It's sturdy and stable. Good display. I had no difficulty putting it together myself, with the exception of two screws that I had to have the manly-man tighten. :);Simple and Functional
84;108.0;5.0;5.0;"Bought this to be able to get in some walking indoors with the Chicago winter coming up. Easy to assemble in less than 30 minutes.

Couldn't be happier with purchase.";Great buy
95;109.0;5.0;5.0;"I was delighted with how easy this manual treadmill was to assemble, and the directions for assembly and operation were completely understandable.\n\n  One thing that would be helpful, is to have an adjuster to raise or lower the angle of the tread itself, rather than be a fixed height, and to have a tensioner to increase drag after having built up strength. [...]\n\n  Personally, being handicapped with a fused left hip, the left leg being 2"" short (I use a lift shoe), and having that leg fixed 20 degrees forward and the foot 20 degrees to the left, I had to aclimate myself as to how I walked, the speed, placement of my hands, and feet, but after a few days I was more comfortable with it, and with the fixed height it was a challange, but as I've learned since I was injured in the military in 1962, where there's a will there's a way, and being a born again Christian I have the LORD'S help, and He never fails.\n\n  For me, having a manual rather than motorized treadmill is a safety feature, and having my disability, I couldn't run but walk swiftly, and if I lost balance or my gait, I'd likely be injured on a powerized treadmill.\n\n  I fully reccomend this treadmill, and it shows, distance, speed, time used, and calories burned, so that's all I need. I plan on getting a wrist blood pressure and pulse reader from Harbor Freight to wear while using this device, so I know my heart rate.";Fantastic for a gimp like me
100;110.0;5.0;5.0;You cannot beat this treadmill for the price. I love the tray on the front. It folds easily. It works well. I can even jog on it. It is VERY lightweight and moves without strain from room to room. The assembly was not difficult. I did it by myself while watching my children in less than 30min. The belt is not jerky at all. The belt has not slipped at all. Oh, and there is literally next to no sound that comes from it. It is very very quiet. All-in-all, I love this purchase.;I am so glad I went with a manual treadmill...

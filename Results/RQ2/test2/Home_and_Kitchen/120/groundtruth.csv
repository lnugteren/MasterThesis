2;1.0;1.0;24.0;"Pros: Fairly large water tank. Protective rubber see-through cover for the on/off button. Pretty yellow paint. Number of attachments that come included.  Includes a screwdriver. Packaging.\n\nCons: Doesn't work as a steam cleaner, which is what it is supposed to do.\n\nAfter much debating and analysing I decided to purchase this Wagner 905 steam cleaner.  It was delivered on time and was actually well packed inside the manufacturer's box.  I opened it up and read the instructions, twice.  I attached the nozzle holder with the included screw driver(seriously, how many companies include an actual decent-quality screwdriver for a 1 screw installation? I thought that was neat).  I filled the hot water tank using the included measuring cup and funnel.  I plugged it in and timed how long it took for the indicator light to go off(it lights up when heating, goes off when it's done heating and steam is ready).  The instructions told me it would take 4-12 minutes.  Yet it took well over 20 minutes.  Okay, no big deal, I could wait a little longer for it to heat up if it worked well....\n\nOnly it didn't work well.  I got massive amounts of water spewing from the tip with intermittent steam.  Hmm, I thought to myself ""Well, maybe you can't fill it with the 16oz cup three times, even though the instructions say you can"" and so I turned if off, allowed it to cool, and about an hour later I dumped out all the water still in the tank and filled it with 32oz of water instead of the 48 I had done previously.  I waited for the indicator light to go off, so I knew it was ready...and waited...and waited...a little over 35 minutes later the light went off.  Well, that was a long time, let's see if it works....\n\nThis time I got a jet of hot water spewing from the nozzle.  Hey, who knew, this is a hot water gun!  Oh, but wait, I don't want to put on a water show like they have in Vegas, I want to steam clean some things.  So I get a bucket, and spew the water into the bucket thinking to myself ""well maybe it just had some water built up in the hose"".  Eventually the water stopped spewing and some steam came out.  I tried to start cleaning and about 5 seconds later more hot water comes jetting out of the tip instead of steam.  So I grab my bucket again and start spraying continuously into the bucket, and what do you know I get varying hot water streams mixed with a little steam, then more hot water, and then the indicator light came on again telling me it needed to heat up, and so I waited till it went off, and then again all I got was hot water.\n\nI tried a third time after letting it cool over night, and got the same results.  Lots of hot water, little to no steam.\n\nThis model has a number of great ratings, so maybe I got a bad one, I don't know, but I do know this was placed in the mail to be returned to Amazon because I have no use for a hot water gun.";Steam cleaner? No.  Hot water gun? Yes.
97;2.0;5.0;677.0;First let me say... I am an agonizer-analyzer. I read all of the reviews out there on Amazon and the web that I can find. I was down to this... the Shark vs. Wagner steamers. Both seemed similar in reviews... I saved $5 bucks by purchasing the Wagner. I received it 1 day earlier then expected. I opened the box and dug in (yes, I am also a person that doesn't necessarily read the instructions... until I can't get something to work that is.) Guess what? EVERYTHING worked without reading the instructions. Note to the wise, it is probably best if you do. I have since gone back to ensure I was operating the machine safely and correctly.\n\nI LOVE IT! When people say in their reviews that they couldn't stop cleaning stuff, it is SOOOOOO true. These are the things I have cleaned so far. 3 kitchen sinks. I couldn't believe how clean they became. They are all stainless and shining like mad. I really do believe they are clean enough to eat out of them (not that I would). I have granite counters with this itty bitty grout between the sinks and the counters. I didn't realize they used white grout... oh my gosh, they look like they were just put in and they are 11 years old.\n\nWhat else? Yes, I didn't stop there. I went over to the stove. It is stainless steel with gas fixtures and iron grates. Do you know how many cleaners I have purchased for the black metal top that have never made it look like it was really totally clean?  MANY, MANY, MANY. This machine did it! And I honestly have to say, I didn't put any real elbow grease in at all. It lifted stains that I thought were permanent. It also removed a burn mark in the stainless steel which had been there for at least 3 years (with a lot of scrubbing that didn't take it away). And, after using the machine, it was really only a matter of wiping a little water residue away.\n\nI really like the length of the handle/hose. I left it on top of one counter and was able to walk around the kitchen without worrying if the yellow beauty was going to fall off the counter or not reach where I wanted to take it. Gotta LOVE IT!\n\nOk, the above were only a few things that I cleaned in the first 15 minutes of opening the box. I probably could have cleaned more but I figured I would save my joy for another day.\n\nA few other comments... I read a review that it was loud to operate. The machine itself doesn't make any noise. It isn't like a motor is going while you are trying to clean. The only noise that is made is the high-pressure steam coming out of the nozzle. What do these people really expect? Hello.... It was music to my ears because of the clean-up it was doing. I can imagine that you wouldn't want to be locked in a small closed in space for long... but hey, it didn't take that long to see it sparkle.\n\nThis truly is a great investment, fun to use with FANTASTIC results.\n\nYAHOO!;Lotta love for this machine!
3;3.0;5.0;24.0;1. Use Distilled Water!!! It has minimal lime deposits in it and will prolong the life of the steamer core and attachments. I bought this unit merely to sterilize, clean, and do many light duty jobs around the house and garage. I actually used this on a car I got recently which had red mud and greasy grime in it because it had been used on a farm. It stripped and cleaned the mud and grease off to where I could just wipe it away as I steamed. It worked great in all the plastic and anywhere I used it. I did not leave it running continuously on any surface, but spritzed each and wiped the dirt away. I even did vents, mirrors, window molding, and the stereo and car's push buttons etc. Just remember to wait for a while until they all dry out before turning them on again. Wouldn't want to blow something. It was great for the rims and tires, bug grime after they were all pre-treated with conditioners and cleaners.\n\n2. Here is the problem with most of these reviews... Most of the people who wrote, viewed this as a stand-alone cleaner. They are wrong.  Remember, this is a steamer and not a high powered water hose. It simply breaks up the crud you are trying to remove. You must come back with water and finish scrubbing it away and THEN wipe it all up. The steamer is quite adequate to remove mildew, dirt, pre-cleaned and pre-soaked items that have degreaser and other pre-cleaning agents applied to them in advance. It is also quick heating, and though the company recommends waiting 20 minutes to refill it, that is not necessary, if you are careful- (you turn it off, can wear heavy DRY gloves -steam will burn you if gloves are wet-and simply ease off the lid very slowly like a bottle of shook up pop. You will hear the pressure escape slowly as you do this until it stops hissing.) Otherwise, while you wait, just clean up the areas you steamed with a magic sponge or paper towel. I can say that if you pre-soak, pre-clean with strong degreasers and other cleaning solutions, you will have very nice results.\n\n3.  This is simply NOT a clean-alone tool. It is really intended to loosen and begin the celaning process,not finish it. So, most of the other reviewers are novice cleaners expecting something like a professional 1500 degree steamer used in industrial applications that WOULD take everything off, plus also destroy most surfaces other than steel. This will sterilize and kill anything as well. But, don't expect it to CLEAN off miss-treated or heavy, cooked on grease alone on stoves. Easy Off is a great pre-treatment, before you used this tool. Stains and other items that are soiled should also be pretreated with reliable agents before you steam with this tool as well. It is not intended to do an entire carpet or an entire anything. It is best for spots and places that can be cleaned and wiped away or to help remove trouble spots. I would never use this on fine fabrics or valuable items. It will damage them. From a distance, the steamer can remove wrinkles, but be sure to vent the water in it(it builds up moisture in the hose), and then gradually squeeze the trigger to release steam in small amounts from a distance.\n\n  Bottom line: This unit is a good tool to do spring cleaning and car cleaning with. You must follow up with towels and disinfectants. It really helped take a lot of the knuckle busting and dry, cracked hands problems I normally have after any cleaning jobs. This unit is also cheaper and better than its counterpart, with better attachments.  Plus, it has a nice warranty.\n\n  None of these units have storage, probably because the parts are still wet when finished with and would mildew.  Just let them air dry and store the whole unit in a plastic tote in the garage on a shelf marked steam cleaner. And always dump out the unit and air dry with cap off. It will undoubtedly get funky inside otherwise.;This is not for heavy duty jobs, just little ones.
92;4.0;5.0;251.0;I originally came here to amazon to buy a steam mop after seeing a popular informercial. I don't trust infomercials so i came here to read reviews about the product. I eventually discovered that instead of a steam mop for just my floors I could get a full steam machine that will do the entire house.\n\nI am so glad i did not get just a steam mop, i would have missed out on the true power of steam. Five minutes after opening the box i had assembled the machine and was filling the tank with water. The steamer heated up quickly and i began steaming. I was excited to see what it could do and it didn't dissappointed.\n\nThere are 2 things in my house that I absolutely hate cleaning. They are the glass enclosed shower stall and the jacuzzi tub. So I started steaming there.\n\nI have a 3 sided, 8ft high glass enclosed shower stall that i dread cleaning ... (it is dreamy to look at, but a nightmare to clean) Using glass cleaners was a tedious chore, it would take over an hour to clean all that glass and it still left streaks in the glass.\n\nThe wagner cleaner did the same job in less than 10 minutes using the squeegee attachment!! And no streaks! My glass stall was perfectly clean and beautiful using just steam. I am excited because now I can clean the glass shower more often instead of avoiding it like i have been doing.\n\nI then went to clean my jacuzzi tub ... this is what prompted me to write this testimonial. I haven't used my jacuzzi in 3 years because of how difficult it was to clean the jet nozzles after using the tub. The jet nozzles in the tub became clogged with soap scum and dead skin after only a few uses and the only way to clean inside those small jet nozzles was with a swab stick. Talk about tedious!\n\nI was so exicted to see the wagner steamer power through that grime in seconds and leave the jet nozzles looking brand spanking new!\n\nThis alone was worth the purchase of this product for me. I haven't used it on my floors yet, but at first glance the floor attachment is a bit small for me. I have a lot of square footage to cover so i wish it was bigger and i wish there were replacement towels. But all in all just based on the way it cleaned the glass shower and the jacuzzi jet nozzles this is a priceles warrior in the battle of the grime!! I don't know how i got along without a power steamer all these years!\n\n**UPDATE**\nDay 2 of cleaning, I discovered my cat has being using my new sofa as a urinal. I decided to try the steamer on the urine stains. I was not sure what to expect but i was amazed and suprised at the result. The urine smell dissapeared without the use of any chemicals. Leaving behind a near perfectly fresh scent. The fabric was black so i cannot comment on whether or not any visual stain was obliterated. But this result with pet urine was exciting enough for me to amend my review.;Steam Power
107;5.0;5.0;128.0;This steamer is TERRIFIC!!! I purchased it to clean tile and grout- especially the kitchen floor. The brush attachment with the terry cloth pad did a good job on the tile-- the brush attachment without the cloth pad was just the ticket for cleaning the grout. AMAZING!! While I've only used it to clean the kitchen floor so far, I gave this product 5 stars because 1) it's solidly made 2) it performs as expected 3) the way they have designed the continuous steam function makes it safer than other steamers I've used 4) it's easier to use than I expected-- the steam ( and good design) did most of the work-- with other steamers I had to do most of the work- without the expected results 5) It's functional and versatile. 6) It's the best steamer product I've used-- much better than most of the ones sold shopping channels. It would be EVEN BETTER if 1) there was an indicator to tell how much water is left in the reservoir 2) there was a really easy way to empty out the water after it's cooled down. All you have to do us unscrew the black knob, pick the steamer up, and then empty it into the sink or a tub. It's not hard, and it's not cumbersome. It could just be more convenient- that's all.;First rate steamer- recommend it highly!!
1;6.0;3.0;136.0;This steamer is great at removing wallpaper, sanitizing tile floors with the floor head and getting the grime out of our hot water heat baseboards (until the nozzle broke--read on).  Not so great at other clean-ups like ovens, grills and bathroom tile where you still need elbow-grease and a green scrub pad to do the best job.  The 3 stars is for mediocre customer support from Wagner.  Within 2 months of purchase, the jet nozzle cracked nearly in half making the steamer useless with this attachment.  Wagner will sell replacements for $2.75 ea +s/h.  M2C -- they should have offered freebies.  If all you want is a wallpaper steamer, there are cheaper alternatives.  This unit is hardly durable enough for regular household cleaning chores.;Great steamer -- but attachments are poorly designed.
4;7.0;1.0;11.0;"I really really wanted this product to work.  As I envisioned it, I would be removing back-breaking scrubbing from my life as the hot steam melted away dirt so all I would have to do was wipe away the leftover grime.  In my fantasy world, all cleaning chemicals would become irrelevant as the power of water and steam sanitized all of my household grime and dirt.\n\nSo I bought the Wagner steamer.  I received it quickly (bravo to Amazon) and it didn't work as promised.  I was so looking forward to not having the back straining work of having to clean my deep jacuzzi tub.  This is what I tried it on first. I am not ashamed to admit that it had a lot of soap scum and dirt on it so if there was a test for the machine's worthiness, this was it.  Long and short, no change in the grime.  It didn't even loosen it for scrubbing purposes.  I tried the power jet attachment and the teeny tiny brush attachment.  I saw some grime removal when I started scrubbing with the teeny tiny brush but no more removal than I would have had, had I used a teeny tiny brush with no steam. And cleaning a large tub with a teeny tiny brush is not my idea of a labor savor. (not even a teeny tiny labor savor) But I still kept the dream alive.\n\nThanks to Amazon, I did a seamless trade in, thinking with all of the positive reviews, I must have had a defective machine. Filled once again with dreams of easy cleaning, I set up my replacement machine and tried my tub with the same result.  Still clinging to my dream, I thought , ""Maybe the material my tub is made out of is just not conducive to then magical cleaning powers of the steamer.""  So I tried it on my stove.  My stove's stains were no more than a week old and yet again, the steamer did nothing to remove the stains.\n\nSo now the dream is dead.  I wonder who all of these people are who love the machine because I would love to be one of them.  Is the Wagner's steamer just a byproduct of excessive viral marketing?  Have they changed their product and the new version is lower quality?  Or am I merely a victim of dumb luck that I received two defective, useless machines in the same week?\n\nNot sure which one but thanks to Amazon's easy return policy, I have no need to stick around and care anymore.  The dream, my friends, is dead.";I really wanted this to work
98;8.0;5.0;62.0;I purchased the Wagner Power Steamer for one reason, to clean grout.  I recently purchased a house built in 2003.  The previous owners did not clean ANYTHING.  The kitchen is full tile with larger grout lines.  I thought the grout was brown, but that was before I started using the Wagner steamer on it.  The kitchen had several areas of the grout that was almost complete black.  The section behind the cooktop was completely covered in grease with a yellowish/red hue.  We tried oven cleaner and it didn't make a dent in the grease.\n\nSo with that said I set the steamer up and used one of the black brush attachments on the small steam wand.  After 10 minutes or so, I had a technique down that worked extremely well.  I would say I spent about three hours cleaning all of the grout lines on my kitchen tile, including the back splashes that go to the bottom of the cabinets.  The grout went from looking brown/black to light grey.  It literally looks like it's brand new.  The grease melted away like it was nothing.  It does take a bit of elbow grease, but the steam does an incredible job of cleaning.\n\nIt also worked well in the shower to remove mildew and soap scum from the grout.  However my area has very hard water and it will not remove hard water stains.  So for some people I have a feeling that the grout gets dirty and then caked with hard water deposits.  The steamer cannot get through this layer, so it cannot clean the grout.  I used a pummace stone in conjunction with the steamer and had much better results.  It also cleaned vinyl flooring and other items around the house well.  For the price I paid, it more than paid for itself on the very first day.  My Mom laughed at me and thought I had bought another 'tool' that wouldn't get used.  She commented after I finished the kitchen of my new home that it was one of the coolest cleaning items she had seen in a very long time.  If you use it for it's intended purpose, I think you will be more than pleased.  If you have hard water deposits, don't count on this to blast them away.\n\nI also tried the flooring attachment, and it works but at a slow pace.  You're better off with a standard cleaner and a scrub brush on a pole.  This tool is more about focused cleaning on a small area, and it excelled for me in that role.;Wagner Power Steamer - Works Great!
91;9.0;5.0;56.0;"I used the steamer the first time while trying to hold down the triger, and thougt ""this is ridiculous"". So before I used it the second time I took a large rubber band and wrapped it around the trigger. The third time I used it, I realized that the trigger had a lock, so once you lock it, it will continue to steam until you unlock it. The problem was when it started unlocking itself after about 10 seconds.\n\nI called customer service and asked them if this was some kind of safety feature, or if it was just something annoying that I would have to live with. I figured that I would have to go back to the rubber band trick. The person I talked to said that she would have to call the manufacturer and ask. A few days later she called me back (I was totally shocked that I heard back from her). Usually they just tell you that, and you never hear from them again. She said that the manufacturer wanted to replace the steamer for me, and within a week I had gotten a complete new system. I don't think I have ever had such great customer service........";Great machine and GREAT customer Service
24;10.0;1.0;26.0;"The first time I tried to use the steamer the connector button fell out.  It's a small part but it is located in the steamer hose.  A small area in the small print of the user manual states ""The water container, heating element and hose are not serviceable""\nI called Wagner, Judy told me to pay postage and mail the heavy unit from California to Minneapolis, MN, that's half the value of the steamer.  No thanks Wagner.";Wagner 905, 1,500 watt on-demand Power Steamer
0;11.0;4.0;55.0;I've found that trying to remove wallpaper is a lot like dating, in that nothing works all the time, and the thing that worked best last time may have disastrous results next time.  That's a roundabout way of saying that when this steamer works, it works amazingly well.  When it doesn't, I can't lay the blame totally with the machine, cuz that's the nature of the beast.\n\nI purchased the Wagner 905 Steamer only to remove wallpaper, and have so far done the equivalent of 4 12x12 rooms.  I have absolutely no complaints with the performance or quality, as it's done exactly what I hoped it would do and hasn't broken.  I do appreciate the manual trigger that other models don't have, and the love-bug-looking styling is kinda fun.  The hose is a generous enough length without being a nuisance, and the handle is well-placed.\n\nI can't attest to the functionality or quality of the many many attachments that are included, but it's rare these days for so many extras to be included with anything.  The very fact that they're there will probably lead me to use the steamer for other functions in the future.\n\nI have no experience with Wagner customer service.\n\nMy bottom line is this:  If you have a big project to tackle, the Wagner 905 Steamer could be a very capable (and valuable) tool in your figurative toolbox.;When its good, its very very good...
31;12.0;1.0;26.0;i purchased this thinking because it was a wagner it would be a great product like others of theirs i have used in the past - nozzle broke with first use - called the company they wanted proof of purchase - sent that in - 2 months later still no part to fix this - a waste of money and no customer service;piece of junk broke with first use
105;13.0;5.0;40.0;Wow!  I have battled light colored tile grout for 3 years.  This steamer did a great job of blasting the dirt right out.  I have used it on tea stains in my car, tile, linoleum (even got the dirt out of the grooves), stove, shower, toilets etc...  I am very pleased.  I do agree with another reviewer's recommendations to wear ear protection when using the small attachments - it is loud.  Using the mop attachment is not a problem.  This is a much better option than a steam mop and not much more expensive.  I love how much I can get done with one fill up and it is so much more versatile and powerful.  This is the best cleaning product I've bought myself.  Every once in awhile I buy something that actually works.;excellent product
119;14.0;4.0;45.0;We bought this primarily for wallpaper removal as well as other cleaning jobs around the house.  There are some good points and bad points to this steamer.\n\nThe good:  The trigger controlled steam nozzle is a great plus.  It puts out plenty of volume and has a decent sized tank that lasts a while.  The hose length is great, we have 10 foot ceilings in our house and the included hose and attachments are more than adequate to reach the top of the wall.  It's made pretty short work of 50 year old wallpaper left above dropped ceiling panels by the previous owners.  Lots of accessories.\n\nThe Bad:  The wallpaper attachment has no catch basin or return line like some steamers have.  You'll need a bucket or large pan handy nearby to set the steamer head in when it isn't being used to catch all of the water or it will wind up all over your floor.  The machine will also cough up a lot of water when you pull the trigger that has made it into the hose either by condensation or design flaw.  Hold the steamer nozzle/attachment over something to catch the water when you pull the trigger after not using it for a minute or two, otherwise a small amount of hot water goes everywhere.  There is also no really good way to store the hose and cord built into the design.  No hooks or recesses to wrap the items around to keep it neatly stowed.  The little pegs that hinge the flip-lid that covers the fill port pop out easily.  They're pretty small and look easy to lose.\n\nSomething else I'd like to see is an additional attachment that would allow soap or other product to be pulled into the steam.  Blasting baked on grease, scrubbing BBQ grills, automotive wheels or even engines isn't terribly effective with just steam.\n\nHere's hoping we don't have the same problem with cracked attachments like a previous reviewer.;OK, but not perfect.
63;15.0;4.0;30.0;I tried a small steam cleaner before and was disappointed that the water ran out too fast due to the small capacity. This Wagner 905 1500-Watt on demand streamer is far more capable than those small steam cleaners. It has big water capacity to last for hours of cleaning work (long working time). The 1500-Watt is good to heat the water fast (minimum waiting time). The long hose is good for me to work on tight corners or high places (good mobility and flexibility). A lot accessories are included for various type of cleaning works (great versatility).\n\nHot steam is a powerful way to clean so many different things. Especially, it's a non-chemical and non-destructive method. However, it has limitations. It's still not the best tool to clean heavy grease area like oven, stove top, grills. Those grease need much higher temperature to be melted down.\n\nNo quite sure why people complains about the noise. When the strong steam comes out of a tiny nozzle, it will sure to create the sound. It's supposed to be this way.\n\nStoring this steamer is kind of challenging due to its long hose and many accessories. You might want to keep the original box, as the original box is the best container to store the steamer, its long hose, its long wire  and all its accessories.\n\nIn summary, a great versatile cleaning tool that each family should have one.;Great versatile cleaning tool.
43;16.0;1.0;23.0;I too purchased the Wagner steamer because of the reviews. I was looking for a steamer that I could use just for cleaning (not wallpaper removal). I had borrowed a hand-held steamer from my mother and remembered that it was a great way of cleaning without chemicals and really getting into the small corners that a towel/wipe couldn't reach.\n\nI was really disappointed with the pressure and heat of the steam. It barely could clean up surface dirt that was easily wiped down with a cloth and the steam was just barely warm (after heating up the unit for about 30minutes)\n\nI also found it really noisy. Not ideal for apartment living.\n\nI really wanted this machine to work well, but I found that a little elbow grease and a cloth work much better and I have returned it to Amazon for a refund.;Didn't work for me...
32;17.0;1.0;20.0;This steam cleaner was purchased after all the good reviews, on how well it cleans. There were some complaints that I read about the quality of the steamer, but it was purchased because the positive reviews far exceeded the negative reviews. As to fact on how well the steamer cleans, I cannot thoroughly review the ability of the steamer. I decided that I would first try out the carpet cleaning attachment. After about 5 minutes of use, the attachment cracked/broke off at the neck of the attachment rendering the attachment useless. As for review of the 5 minutes of use that I did get, I can honestly say that it seems that it was cleaning fairly well and really refreshing the life of the carpet that I was able to clean. However, since the attachment broke so quickly I have to give the one star rating for this cleaner. I will be returning this defective unit in hopes of exchanging for another one. I will give the benefit of the doubt and assume that I was unlucky and I received a unit that was defective. I have searched online and was unable to find any replacement attachments, which is disappointing, although I take that as a sign that normally the attachment does not fail, so selling replacement attachments is needless. I will update this review after I am able to exchange/return this cleaner.;Broke within 10 minutes of use.
26;18.0;1.0;19.0;I am baffled as to how this product received so many 5 star reviews.  I tried cleaning a stove top, bathroom tile, a stainless steel sink and a greasy cupboard door, and the steam cleaner didn't do any better than a quick wipe with a wet cloth. Either the steam isn't hot enough, or the spray isn't strong enough, or steam-cleaning in general just isn't that effective.;Not Effective Cleaner
36;19.0;2.0;21.0;"I bought this cleaner based on the reviews that I have seen. I wish I would have checked the Wagner website, where I would have discovered that this is not really meant for cleaning, but for surface prep (e.g. taking off wallpaper). While the machine itself works well, it is lacking some key accessory tools for it to really be considered a steam ""cleaner"". It has a large brush to clean the floor, and the steam comes out one hole in the center of the brush which has bristles that stand the steam hole over an inch from the floor. A lot of the steam goes out sideways through the bristles instead of actually focusing on the floor. Works for a light clean when you put the pad on it, but not a deep clean using the brush by itself.  The pad for the brush is basically just a flimsy rectangular piece of terry cloth. It would be nicer if it had a more substantial microfiber pad. The window squeegie doesn't work very well. It blows so much steam on the window, the squeegie is fairly useless. You need to stop the steam and re-squeegie the entire window. Dirty water seems to get everywhere - you definitely need some rags to soak it up! Lastly (and most important), there is no mid sized tool to clean things like a countertop. There is just a tiny brush head or the big floor brush. Nothing mid sized. The big brush does not work well on the counter (nor does it deep clean as mentioned earlier), and the tiny brush is good to spot clean, but is not practical to use on the entire countertop, sink, etc. That said...the machine itself works quite well, and the tiny brush is fantastic for grout lines, spot cleaning, etc. However, I was looking for a product that works on the whole house, so I will likely be returning it.";Good Product, but lacking key accessories
111;20.0;3.0;35.0;I just received my Steam Cleaner today and already I'm impressed. It has far exceeded my expectations in just one day. I cleaned my SOFA, BATHROOM TILE, FORMICA and BBQ GRILLE. Seemed like I just couldn't stop once I got started. Haven't cleaned this much in one day in... well, I don't know when. I had thought about buying one of the more expensive ones but thought I would give this a try first. Boy, I'm sure glad I did. I couldn't believe how hot the steam gets. I do wish it had just a bit more power. Also, there seems to be a bit of water seepage from the nozzle, but not too bad. I also cleaned a few dirty spots on my carpet that I couldn't even get up with cleaner. You have to blot the moisture away with a clean cloth as you go, but it took out the stains without any scrubbing which has a tendency to damage your carpet. I can't wait to use it to detail my car. And my husband seems to always need my help cleaning his motorcycle, even though I refuse to ride it with him. None the less, can't wait to see what kind of damage I can do with my little yellow machine on those wheels. Also have some wallpaper to remove, which is primarily why I bought it in the first place. For the price, I think this little machine is worth the money.;Great Little Steam Cleaner
30;21.0;1.0;19.0;I was very disappointed in this steamer and we are sending it back.  I purchased it to remove wallpaper.  I could not do the border paper around the ceiling in our bedroom because the steam plate is too big and messes up the regular wall that the plate covers in addition to the border.  Literally, tried putting an old cloth diaper on the lower half of the plate to absorb the water and steam.  What a mess!  Our wallpaper in the bath room striped off leaving me with the backing.  When I attempted to steam this off, it did not work well at all.  After it was first filled and I waited the time needed to produce steam, the initial use of it resulted in lots of water running out of the bottom of the plate.  Then the actual steam pressure was reduced and it required lots of time of holding the plate in one place.  The steam power didn't last very long and the light was constantly coming on indicating the power was not at maximum  The capacity is only 48 oz. so I was always needing to refill the tank.  I was constantly having to turn it off, unplugging,  letting it cool down, refilling the tank, letting it heat up and starting all over again. All of this was according to the directions!!  (About a 20-25 minute process each time!!) Very little of my time was spent steaming.  And each time I started with a tank full of water that had reached the required temperature, the initial steam out of the plate resulted in lots and lots of running water down the walls. (Lost lots of water that way which is why it always needed refilling.)  So much so that it actually left a water stain in several places.  This may work well with the other attachments but for me, using it for wallpaper removal was not a good thing at all.;Wagner 905
5;22.0;1.0;5.0;I really wanted to like the Wagner 905 steamer. I read all these great reviews and thought: this is it! My grout is dark with dirt that doesn't want to come out. I steamed my tile floor slow, fast, tried different heads...nothing worked. All it did was leave behind a watery mess. I tried using it on my glass shower doors? Nope. Didn't remove hard water spots. Maybe this is good for removing wallpaper, but I bought it for everything else, and at everything else, it sucked.\n\nThe bristles on the small brush attachment bent permanently within the first minute of use.  Also, it comes with so many (useless) attachments, and no where to store them all. It seems like there's cord everywhere and I was happy to send this right back to Amazon. I am shocked at the amount of positive reviews.;Waste of money and my time.
8;23.0;3.0;9.0;I purchased this item on it's good reviews and probably should have taken a closer look at the negative reviews. The day it showed up I was totally excited to see if it was as wonderful as most people have said about steam cleaners. I was less then thrilled at the results. I started looking online for an answer...did I expect too much, was I using it incorrectly?\n\nIn the end I had Amazon ship another one. I'm glad I did. Thank you Amazon's customer service for being quick and courteous. Now that I know how to navigate through customer service I really am confident about my future purchases. So I opened the second one and sure enough there was a huge difference in the performance of the product.\n\nThings I noticed about the first unit that made me question it's performance was the water condensation in the power switch. It still happened in the second unit but not as bad. Secondly my first unit made steam but it didn't seem hot enough. There was a noticeable difference with the second unit. If the tool is touching a surface and creating steam the surface should be somewhat hot to the touch afterwards. Thirdly, the light kept going on and off way too often and I was getting way too much water. Although you usually get water even with my working unit, I just make sure I get the steam going over a sink first. A general gripe I haven't heard from anyone else is that both units smelled like burning plastic when I first used it. It still smells that way. I'm assuming it's whatever VOC's the product has. I hope the smell starts to go away with repeated use of the system.\n\nMy biggest test was to get some puke out of my minivan, it definitely helped the situation. My concerns with down the road echos many others where I can see running into a problem with the hose in the future and having no way to replace it. I also wish there was a way to keep some of the attachments on the unit, although I understand the design is to make it small and compact, trying to keep track of the squeegee, the steam brush, the little nozzle pieces might be difficult with my children around. If not a way to keep the attachments on the unit then possibly a way to retract the power cord or some sort of good method for coiling the hose around the unit.;Rocky start to a better friendship
103;24.0;4.0;28.0;"The main reason I bought the steamer is becuase the previous owners of our house hired one of those ""creative finish"" businesses to remodel the master bathroom. This involved spraying a multispek, non-skid coating on the 55-year old tiles. It looked great, but NOTHING gets it clean (it's off-white) and you have to be really careful about chemicals. In short, a pain to clean.\nThis product worked as well as anything I've used, but not better. It's okay for floors. I also have a lighter floor in my kitchen and was really excited to see some reviewers who had the same really liked the product. Clearly, they mop/clean more than I do. Again, it's as good as chemicals so I'll continue to use it. I also, as one reviewer said, think the more I use it, the more layers of grime I will go through and it may become more effective on the floors.\nI do LOVE it for baseboards, that gross junk around faucets, and around the bottom of the toilet where it meets the floor. I would say it's good for the small, weird stuff in hard-to-get-to places.\nDO NOT USE THIS ON WOOD FLOORS! I am amazed at the number of reviewers who use this on real wood floors. It will warp them, it's STEAM!\nCons: No outside water gague so you're supposed to empty the tank before you fill it up each time (you can't see how much water is in the tank), needs a retractable cord or cleats to wind the cord on, and the cord/hose placements are a little awkward.\nPros: Lightweight, no chemicals, great to clean tough areas, washable pad, will pay for itself after a while because of not buying a lot of the cleaners I normally buy.";Worth The Money
118;25.0;4.0;31.0;"This steamer works good on tough wallpaper, if your not in a hurry. I'm a small remodeling contractor and I'm happy to have the Wagner on demand steamer. The pressurized steam is great for getting into tight spaces. I have used the steamer mostly for wallpaper removal. If you have a large job, over 600 square feet, I would recommend renting a ""commercial"" steamer. If you have the time this steamer will do the job. Keep a bucket and pan(9x12) close by to catch  the excess water. It shoots out water if you let it sit for a few minutes, so keep a bucket close. The extensions are useful. It steams up fairly quick. This makes it great for cleaning up spills or small bits of glue and paper left behind. I'm glad I chose this type of steamer over a non-pressurized steamer.";Good for small jobs.
113;26.0;5.0;28.0;I bought this product after my neighbor gave me a demo. I was pretty inpressed. I got mine last week and cleaned about 1,000 square feet of tile/grout. It came out like brand new. I wish I would have bought this a long time ago. At this price it's a steal.;This product rocks!
101;27.0;5.0;24.0;"I love this steamer!  This is the 3rd steamer I've owned and it by far surpasses the others.  The holding tank offers a full hour or more of steam, it puts off a much more powerful burst of steam than other cleaners and all the attachments are wonderful.  I love to clean, even if you don't like to clean; this makes cleaning fun!";best steam cleaner I've tried
9;28.0;5.0;8.0;A good friend bragged about the uses of this item, and I was extremely leary of ANYTHING that could possibly be this efficient. The thought of cleaning windows without all the work of going inside outside inside outside to get rid of streaks was very time consuming, even with so called 'streak free' window cleaners. I didn't really see any reviews that would sell me on the need for this item, but his enthusiasm for this unit could not be ignored.\n  Not to sound like a fanatic.....  I LOVE THIS THING.  I hate cleaning glass sliding doors and we have dogs who love to nose streak the glass.  4 MINUTES, inside and out....and you better put some kind of sticker on the glass or somebody WILL walk into the glass. This is the cleanest my windows and glass sliders have ever been....and in a fraction of the time. I do a bi-weekly clean just so I don't ever see the windows. For inside the house, in the evenings, I fill up the machine, plug it in and its ready by the time dishes are washed. We have tile/ grout counter tops with the same floors through the house. All counter tops, table tops, and the floor ....steam off with small brush, stuck food and stains come off effortless, in about 10 minutes total. Grab a clean towel and wipe. And with out any chemical cleaners what so ever.  Both bathrooms, 10 minutes total, including counter top, mirrors,toilet and floor. Fantastic for cleaning grout.  Overall, it takes less time to keep up on cleaning and maintaining the household, and saves on things like cleaners and paper towels.  And by the way, ever have car windows streaked after paying for a wash.. never been clearer since this unit.  Lay a towel over dash, to keep droplets from wand out of vents and have streak free windows. Trust me on this...1000's of uses will be found . Had steamer for about 3 months now with no complaints\n  Did I say I really love this thing?  5 out of 5.;best household tool ever!!!!!!!!!
22;29.0;4.0;12.0;I bought this steamer over a year ago and have used it several times. My favorite use for it is to clean the window sills and base boards, the kitchen and the tile grout. I have white grout (dumbest idea ever) and the steamer cleans it really well though I still have to get down on my hands and knees and wipe with a bit of vigor. It still sure beats the toothbrush and bleach method. I read many of the bad reviews on this machine and without trying to be snide, I have some simple answers to people's woes. Always use distilled water in the machine. Any hard water minerals will eventually cause damage to the inside mechanism. Never pour more water into the machine when you first run out of steam. The inside chamber acts like a pressure cooker and is extremely hot. Therefore if you pour water that is cold or even tepid, you are risking serious damage to the chamber not to mention yourself. Before you open the water gasket after use, always make sure to turn the machine off and keep the steam nozzle locked to the on position. This allows any steam that might be trapped inside to escape through the nozzle and not through the gasket which could potentially cause a burn. If you simply cannot wait for the machine to naturally cool down before adding more water, you must microwave the water you will be adding until almost boiling. This will not only avoid possible damage but will also speed up the heating process so when you are in the middle of a project, you decrease wait time until steamer is ready. Remember that this steamer is here to help decrease the need for chemical cleaners, and does a fine job in very little time. I am very satisfied with my choice and recommend to others looking for a good priced machine. The only true negative for me is the cord. It does not have a place so I just have to wrap it around the steamer when I put it away. Slightly annoying.;satisfied with this steamer
115;30.0;5.0;25.0;I bought this item to remove wallpaper, but found another really handy use for it.  Recently, I moved a lot of furniture in my home and there were annoying carpet indentations from where the furniture smashed down the carpet.  I tried vaccuumming and even a carpet washing machine to fluff up the carpet with little result.  I used the steamer and the small brush attachment and was amazed that the carpet simply 'sprung' back to its original state.  No brushing was actually required.  The steam alone did the job.  Also, the machine heats up faster than I expected.;Impressive Performance
88;31.0;5.0;22.0;"Purchased this after Stanley Steemer did a pathetic job cleaning the tile and grout in our new home. So far, I have only used it to clean the grout in our kitchen, and it works great. I think it is probably the best way to clean grout. We tried the various baking soda, vinegar, hydrogen peroxide solutions, and they are way too labor intensive. We haven't tried it on the actual tile yet, because we found that the generic ""magic eraser"" mops work like magic (We discovered this prior to purchasing the steamer.\n\nI read some reviews before buying it. Some worried me because they claimed the different attachements were poorly made. After opening it, I would completely disagree. They are very well built. The only problem I see is that the plastic scrubber attachment nozzles soften from the heat, so they lose their scrubbing ability. They make up for it by providing one with metal bristles (They should provide more though).\n\nFor those who complain that it is too loud, what did you expect? It is a jet of steam. If it were quiet, it would just be a breeze of steam, and a breeze of steam doesn't clean grout. Wear earplugs if you are going to be using it for any extended peiod of time.\n\nI recommend it.";Great for Grout!
99;32.0;1.0;22.0;I bought this product to primarily clean the grout in the bathroom.  I was also hoping that it would work well for the kitchen floor.  I was so disappointed.  I had read the previous reviews and thought this sounded like it performed fairly well.  Well it didn't.  I sent it back.  Not only was it loud - I was almost deaf after using it in the bathroom with the noise echoing off of all that tile - but it just didn't do much at all.  Maybe it works good for other things?;Did not perform well
62;33.0;1.0;18.0;This product is not useful for removing older wallpaper. Can damage wall board underneath and is less effective than liquid wallpaper remover.  Perhaps it would work well for the removal of more modern wallpapers, but if you have multiple layers of wallpaper in an older house I would recommend the liquid wallpaper remover instead.;Not useful for older wallpaper
44;34.0;1.0;14.0;This steamer throws out too much water! Attempted to use on windows and had to mop the excess water from everywhere! When there is that much water present, the steam doesn't work. I let the steamer heat longer than the indicator light, that didn't help. I suspended the hose after use to rid of any excess water in the hose, that didn't help. All it does is throw alot of water with a little steam. The steam on my iron could do a better job. I was REALLY disappointed when attempted to use in the bathroom, better off using a spray bottle. In the kitchen, it didn't even loosen small spills except where I let the water sit. I can't imagine trying to use to remove wallpaper (which is one of the main reasons I purchased). I have attempted to work with Wagner, but have reached a wall there. I'm not new to cannister steam cleaners. I have used 3 different ones, loved them, so decided to splurge and get my own. Thought the Wagner name would make it a good purchase, my mistake. Very disappointed!!;MO MOM
7;35.0;4.0;6.0;I have tried out the Wagner on a few things so far:\n\n1.  Kitchen floor grout:  I used the hand steamer wand and was very satisified.  I used the round metal brissel tip and scrubbed away.  The steam was very hot and created just enough water to wet the grout good and just enough air power to blow the dirty water away from the cleaned area.  I used a dry towel to wipe away the dirty water.  I would steam an area and then wipe.  I also tried putting the dry towel where the dirty water would just blow into the towel and that worked pretty good too. This will take time but i knew that.  Cleaning requires time and a little elbow grease and this tool is making a hard task much easier to do. So far I have cleaned and sealed one small area and it looks great.  The machine seems to be well built but time will tell.\n\n2.  Hall walls: I cleaned the walls with the floor steamer and that went well.  I recently had sheetrock work done and afterwards wiped down my walls with water and cleaner.  My walls ended up streaked and didn't look good.  I took the wagner floor steamer with cloth attached and ran it over the walls. It just took a minute and they looked much better.  I will need to do it again and the streaks will be completely gone plus my walls look realy clean. I used sherwin williams washable flat when we  painted so i felt pretty confident it would not hurt my walls.\n\n3.  Tiled floor:  I used the floor steamer with cloth and it was okay.  It was about like using a mop.  Actually i liked using it better because i really don't like mops. I only did a small area just to check it out.  I would not say it sanitized but it does get up dirt and is easier to me than running a sink of water and having to ring out a dirty mop.  I did not plan on using this part (floor attachment) of the Wagner because i also purchsed the Eureka Euro floor steamer to do my floors. I purchased the Wagner mainly for the hand steamer part but having all the attachments are an added bonus.\n\n3.  Stove:  I used the hand steamer to clean the stove.  I wanted to get into all the cracks where food stuff had settled.  It worked great for this. There was no grease so i am don't know how it will do on grease.  I plan to take it to my father's this weekend and use it on his stove.  He does have some grease buildup so i will post on that later.\n\nI plan to use the Wagner hand steamer on my rock fireplace, bathrooms, etc.  I will update my post at that time.  I gave the Wagner a 4 and not a 5 because i really don't have anything to compare it to and am leaving room for anything that may arise.\n\nHope this helps.  I will say i am a pretty picky customer and have nothing to gain by this review except to help make this a helpful review site.;Wagner 905 1st day review...to be continued
39;36.0;2.0;13.0;Have had this unit almost a month and to say the least, it has been a bit of a disappointment.\n\nOriginally I had ordered the more expensive McCulloch which seemed to operate beautifully. However, I don't recommend it unless you have no qualms about suffering an early demise from the toxic fumes emanating from the unit's Chinese PLASTIC BOILER!\n\nSo after returning the McCulloch, I opted for the less expensive Wagner which boasts an Aluminum boiler\nNO toxic fumes, but little comes out of the thing other than hot water. It does emit some steam, but I am never sure it is sanitizing quality.\n\nBoth the WAGNER and the McCulloch appear to come out of the same factory and are nearly identical, with the exception of minor cosmetic differences and Plastic vs Aluminum boilers.\nMy non-professional efforts in trying to measure the steam temperature at the nozzle, indicated 112 Degrees F., but should not be considered accurate.\n\nI still have seven more days left to consider returning the WAGNER, and in the meantime will try to convince myself to keep the thing, because I feel I'm taking unfair advantage of Amazon's liberal return policy.;EXERCISE CAUTION
6;37.0;1.0;5.0;After reading all the positive reviews, I wanted this product to work, I really did.  I'm wondering if I just have different standards of cleanliness than those who had positive reviews, or if I got a bad product, but it just didn't work better than scrubbing with a wet sponge and no soap.  Having said that, if you haven't cleaned your house in about 3 months, then yes, a little steam goes a long way (as does a sponge...), but if you clean your house every 2 weeks or so, you're not going to notice any difference with the steamer.\n\nI tried the shower (tile).  Nothing.  I tried the carpet.  After doing more damage to my carpet than cleaning it, nothing.  I tried the grill.  You guessed it.  Turning the grill on and heating it for a few minutes, then using a steel brush works much easier and better than trying the steamer on the grill.  Sadly, I waited past the return period and am stuck with it now.\n\nOn a side note, Costco had this on their shelves for 1 week only.  Makes you wonder if they just had too many returns to make it profitable.;Doesn't work as advertised
110;38.0;4.0;21.0;Great product.  Same product as SteamFast and McCullough brand steams, though costs less.  It does not have the triangular brush and instead has wallpaper remover.  So far does great job of cleaning grout and upholstery and just as well as the Ladybug brand product my inlaws have.  Only downside is you have to wait to cool it off before a refill, though reservoir has plenty of capacity for at least and hours worth of work...Overall great for the price.;Great product for the price.
71;39.0;5.0;17.0;My Wagner 905 & I are resting after I put him through his paces.  Believe you me, he's a hot little thing!  First we did it on the floor, then up in the bathroom, then in the hallway, and finally, both on top of the stove AND in the oven!  Oh, did I mention that if I wanted to, I could have my racks cleaned! All my life I have dreamed of steamy action like this.\n\nSeriously, I was amazed at how well the floor tool cleaned my vinyl floor. I have a litter box in that room & a dog who thinks she's a cat, except sometimes she misses.  Whatever, the dust gets on the floor, and you know what a pain that is to keep after.  I used a piece of old toweling as my absorbent pad, (the floor tool has these wonderful springy grips that hold it tightly in place) and steamed the crap right off the floor.  It didn't seem to get the stains out of the carpet in my back hallway, but next time I will try soaking with a detergent solution, then steaming, followed by blotting.\n\nUpstairs in the bathroom, it got the grime off the faucets.  The bathroom is old, and the tub surround is old and cracked.  No miracles here.  I have a wool rug in the upstairs hall, and this steamed up beautifully and as an added bonus, the brush on the floor attachment picked up the cat/dog hair wonderfully!  I liked that.\n\nBack to the kitchen:  Where I live we have really hard water. (I use distilled for the steamer).  We have one of those refrigerators with a water dispenser.  This tool was the only thing I have EVER found that even touches the hard water streaks.  I really liked that.\n\nMy stovetop?  Tell you what, I like drip pans and I have always hated this stove because it doesn't have 'em.  I do a lot of cooking, and sometimes the stuff builds up around the burners.  The 905 got it.  No streaks, no greasy residue, the stove looked better than it had in months.  Ditto the oven.  I put the racks on a towel on the back porch & went to town with the nozzle.  Hey, I even put a cookie sheet down & watched that baked - on greasy residue soften up.\n\nIt's a steamer, not a carpet steamer.  Undoubtedly it sanitizes...and I have my eye on a wasp nest that might get steamed away someday...I can't do my wood floors with it (boo hoo), but it was so gratifying to see my old vinyl floor come clean.\n\nI wore glasses, and gardening gloves, made sure I didn't steam out all the water in the tank, and chose my target thoughtfully.  One more caveat:  if you have a newer no - wax floor, this might not be an appropriate cleaning tactic. I read that high heat might remove the shine. My flooring must be 30 years old, and I just wanted it clean.;Clean and satisfied
60;40.0;3.0;15.0;"I write reviews for the same reasons I read them. To point out things that a potential buyer should consider before purchase.\n\nThis steamer could be a 5 star product, but it has a few deficiencies that take away from its usefulness.\n\nCapacity. As with any steamer, you have to fill it and then wait until it heats up before using. This unit has a 16oz capacity, which is good for about 10 minutes of use. Once empty, you have to wait fro the unit to cool down and then repeat the process. So those 10 minutes of steam take about 30 minutes.\n\n[CORRECTION 9/2009]\nI've been informed that the capacity is 48oz. (3x16oz cups). I'll stick with my 3 star rating though. 3 times more water would me much longer heatup time.\n[END]\n\nEase of use. You shouldn't leave water in the unit when not in use. Also you shouldn't add more than the max capacity (16oz), so you should start with an empty tank so you know how much water goes in. The filler hole is behind a door at the top of the unit and they provide a small funnel to help fill it. But to empty it out, you have to turn the whole steamer upside down. No an easy task. Add to that the fact that the steam hose and electric cord are fixed. So you have to lug the whole mess around with you. That's about 8-10 feet of hose and 12 or so feet of cord. They don't have any way to coil either or help make it easier.\n\nEffectiveness. I use mine to clean bird cages and if you hit a pile of dried bird poop with a pressurized stream of 200 degree steam, it just melts away. So hit it with the steam and wipe it off and you're done. But the main reason to do it with a steamer is it disinfects whatever you steam. Same reason you cook meat to over 160 degrees.\n\nI haven't used it on wall paper, but I would suspect that it would be quite time consuming. Even the box claims that it is 20% faster with the steamer. So an hour of scraping would take 48 minutes of steaming. add in the refilling, cooling waiting to heat up times and you'd probably spend twice as much time using this steamer as elbow grease.\n\nSo if you're a parrot owner, this is much better than those ""seen on TV"" units, and in my opinion worth the extra cost. It is also much easier and more effective than scrubbing, so you'll be more prone to clean your cages thoroughly.\n\nI am happy with this purchase.";Could Be a 5 Star Steamer but....
52;41.0;2.0;14.0;"After reading some of the glowing reviews here, I ordered TWO of the steamers.  One for myself, and one for another family member.  Opened the box, read the instructions, filled with water and started steaming.  I noticed that the unit produces big clouds of steam and noise... but the actual cleaning results were underwhelming at best.  In fact, I would say that it wasn't as effective as a bucket of hot water and a brush or microfiber cloth.  The steam temperature drops to just lukewarm a couple inches away from the nozzle.  So, I dont' get the raves.\n\nI tried it on the following items/areas:\n\n1) Greasy area at the junction of the aluminum door frame in our retail shop.  Result:  No better than wiping with Windex and a paper towel.\n\n2) Barbecue grill.  Steam and the little brush attachment did about as well as... hot water and a brush.\n\n3) Shower stall.  No appreciable effect on mildewy grout in corner, except that I think the pressure ""blew out"" some of the grout, which I will have to replace.\n\n4) Window.  Used the squeegee attachment to clean a window.  Again, I didn't see any advantage over regular cleaning solution and a squeegee.\n\nThe two things in our house that are challenges for us to clean (we keep a very clean house), are the BBQ grill (it's just a mess to clean), and the shower stall, which we have to clean almost daily because the material the landlord used to ""refinish"" the shower is semi-porous and therefore quickly gathers gunk.  I really had hopes that the steamer would help with these... but it just didn't.\n\nDidn't try it on the floor, because I really couldn't see the point.\n\nWe're returning them.  Love Amazon, was really disappointed in this steamer.  Maybe it's good for removing wallpaper.";Sorry... Was No Better than Hot Water and a Brush.
18;42.0;5.0;8.0;"I spent a lot of time researching various steamers, as I tend to do with most products that I buy, and this one seemed to fit the budget factor as well as the convenience factor. I got mine at Lowe's, which was more expensive at the time, but I was having an instant gratification moment. Still, I didn't regret paying more once I started using it.\n\nTruth be told, I'm on my second Wagner, since the first one broke within two weeks. However, I feel that it was my fault, because, being my impatient self, I was adding somewhat cold water to an already-hot tank, which one day tipped over not too long after I filled it and stopped working. I loved the machine enough to go out and get a new one a few months later, especially noticing how much more of a chore cleaning felt without it - not to mention how much more I hated the smell of chemicals or what it did to my hands. We lost the receipt to the old one and wound up paying more than the first time for the 2nd, though we did manage to return the 1st later on well after the fact. Still, I didn't regret it either way. The current one has lasted over a year and without any problems, despite very consistent use, which I'm thrilled about. In fact, I just got done using it again and felt compelled to write a review. Ha...\n\nWhile the design of the machine is a bit of a pain, being that you pretty much are dragging it around by its hose, it works well for most things. I have hard well water, so I have a little bit of trouble when it comes to my glass-walled shower and porcelain sinks due to mineral buildup or rust. I've not used it on wallpaper, but it's done a great job on our granite counters, mirrors and glass, grout (with some help and a lot of immediate mopping up), dusting, wood surfaces and so forth. It took a while and a bit of experimenting to sort what it would or wouldn't work well on, but once I figured it out, it made cleaning virtually a breeze. In fact, it's almost addicting once you get started.\n\nI think it's just a matter of using common sense and realizing that it's not some harsh chemical that's going to clean everything under the sun. You're basically treating it like any cleaner, which you still have to wipe up or scrub at, only it's less expensive, not smelly or riddled with chemicals and residue. You also have to sort for yourself what distance to hold the attachment at from the object that you're cleaning. For example, I always spray the hose in the sink if it's been sitting a while to get the condensation out, as well as keep it a good distance away from mirrors/glass that I'm cleaning. This simply steams the glass, rather than dousing it, making it easier to clean. Also, be careful with the scrub brush on the microwaves or appliances with painted-on buttons (for lack of a better term) - going too long or scrubbing too hard will just scrape it off.\n\nPlease note that this is not designed to clean fabrics or carpet. If you're looking at this machine for that purpose then you will be disappointed. I noticed a lot of people leaving negative reviews primarily complained about this when it's being totally unrealistic. It might work on fresh stains (doubtful), but you need to properly saturate and agitate the stain, as well as to be able to suction it up, which this machine obviously isn't designed to do. In this sense, you're better off buying a carpet cleaner, hiring a service, or renting a something like Rug Doctor (I actually bought one and use it often).\n\nI actually was a bit nervous about using the hard floor cleaning attachment after reading reviews about how it would snap on people. So, I went out to buy the Eureka steam mop, seeing as how well steam worked for everything else. While I still use the Eureka now and then, I often find that I like the results of the Wagner more, which doesn't seem to leave streaks on our tile floor, and tend to use it if I've already got the machine going. It also just feels easier to use and I've not felt like it was going to break anytime soon.\n\nIf your grout lines are lower than the tile surface, you may need to use the small brush attachments, even though the floor attachment does have a brush on it. The pads given are basically like thin, terry cloth towels. I also use old kitchen towels or microfiber cloths, since you only get two floor pads (if I remember right).\n\nI like to clean my walls in order to help deodorize the place, and find that this works great. I'm a lazy cleaner, but discovered that using the floor attachment with an absorbent towel attached works well on washable walls (would test first!) and quickly, too. It makes getting at the baseboards easy, and I even use it on the cabinets and doors for a quick dusting. Just don't rub your walls hard or leave it one spot for too long, or you may soften the paint and mar it.\n\nThere is also a little, red button near the trigger that can be pressed down in unison, locking the steam on to spray consistently. This was one of the features that really sold me, but I had a hard time finding it in other brands. It happens to be one of my favorite things about it, especially since I have pretty stiff fingers from typing all day long. Keep in mind that this will run your tank out faster, of course, but it's ideal for wall cleaning, mopping, showers and so forth.\n\nThis is an inexpensive machine, so the attachments aren't going to last you forever. It comes with several plastic brush attachments, which will wear down over time. There is also a brass one, which will also wear down eventually. You can, however, purchase them from the website, although I've not had to yet. Certain tasks will also require certain attachments to get the job done, so you might need to experiment. For instance, some of the grout in my house requires the brass brush vs. the plastic ones. You still have to sop up the dirty water to remove the stain.\n\nAll in all, it's convenient for more heavy-duty or weekly type cleaning. However, it can be loud, seeing as how it's pressurized steam coming out of a tiny, little nozzle, so it may not be convenient for daily use or if you live around others. It's great for basic cleaning and even small things, like removing wax from counters or stickers left on whatever. I may try to get a smaller unit solely for the daily cleaning in the kitchen and bathroom. I really love using this on a week-to-week basis, though, and feel that the price is more than fair; therefore, highly recommend it.";Love This Thing!
10;43.0;5.0;6.0;"This item is just what we needed!  We love it! As with all items, there are pros and cons, but for us the pros outweigh the cons.  Issues with the cleaner include (1) no ""low water"" notification, (2) no storage for accessories, (3) no medium-size brush which would be helpful for numerous cleaning jobs, and (4) no carrying handle.  All these issues are minor and if this cleaner disappeared from my home tomorrow, I'd buy another one immediately.  Here is why: (1) when I finished cleaning the bathroom, it looked BRAND NEW.  Not clean, but new - as if it had never been used.  The fixtures sparkled and my mirror has never been so clear.  (2) The item is easy and inexpensive to use.  All you need are some microfiber wipes and distilled water.  (3) The cleaner made cleaning drip pans in the kitchen, a once dreaded chore, an absolute breeze.  Same goes for the rack in the shower, which is chrome and prone to water spots.  The steam cleaner made it gleam as if it just came from the store.  (4) My fiance loved it.  This is a miracle, because he's never impressed with anything.  I've recommended this cleaner to numerous people.  Some of them rushed right out to buy it and were glad they did!  Can't say enough good things about it!";Just what we needed!
11;44.0;1.0;6.0;<update>\nJust downgraded another star after few more trial..This thing is worthless. Mine as well, use Clorox wipes. It takes 10 minutes to heat the water, and even then, it does not steam anything out.\n\nIt fails:\nTo get rid of soap scum on shower tile.\nTo get rid grease and break dust on automobile wheels\nTo dissolve grease on the grill\n</update>\n\n after I would hate to downgrade this item's rating as I see many buyers seem to enjoy it and I am sure they have good experience. However, I cannot imagine that it deserves such high ratings. It is possible that I may have gotten a lemon, but I see that also quite a few buyers are critical of this item for the same reason.\n\nThe problem is: It does not steam out hot enough.....\n\nThe item came well packed and ready to go. Installation was very easy. It is a nicely design equipment. Just fill in the water tank, and wait 10 minutes for water to get hot until indicator comes off...Fine......But the steam that comes out of this is mediocre. It is not sufficient to dissolve hard to clean scum and grease. You almost have to direct the steam to one point for a minute to see it working. I can, instead, use a sponge and wipe the scum off in two swipes, saving time and electricity. Honestly, I am not exaggerating, I held my hand a bout 6 inches away from the steam hose, and I was able to bear the heat. So, you can imagine. Besides,after few minutes of use, you have to wait for water the heat up again.\n\nI see that few users were also mentioning the same problem.\n\nMy verdict for this steamer is:\nDO NOT BUY !;Not  useful ! Steam is not hot enough...
102;45.0;4.0;16.0;I did not want to spend the money on something like this but I am glad I did. I does a great job on bathrooms and cleans windows wonderfuly. The one down fall was that it did not take out the small stains in the carpet like I would have liked but it did an OK job. Cleans baseboards with ease. I would recommend this machine. It is a great little cleaning machine!! All the attachments that it came with were very helpful.;Great Cleaning Machine!! I love it!!
50;46.0;2.0;12.0;I bought this steamer from Amazon 6 months ago, and have been using it on a regular basis. Mostly for the mop function.\n\n Within 1 month of owning it the mop handle snapped in half. I figured maybe I was using too much pressure. I paid for a replacement handle,and began using it again...GENTLY. Three months later the mop handle again snapped in the exact same place. It is made of plastic, and narrow right at the center where pieces join. This is a very weak spot, and a major design flaw. The handle is also extremely difficult to fit together. The pieces do not snap together or come apart easily.\n\nNow this week the cord covering has split and is coming off. This is the plastic that covers the tube that carries steam from the tank to the nozzle. So now the tube that carries steam is uncoiling and is exposed.\n\nI have tried using this steamer to clean greasy ovens, and barbeques. It will soften the grease a little, but will not make it melt off like on commercials.\n\nIt is only marginally effective at cleaning grout. Honestly - some Ajax and a toothbrush work WAY better.\nI have used a paper towel on floors that I have just steamed.....the towel comes up dirty. How can this steamer possibly be sanitizing anything if there is still dirt on the floor after using it??\n\nThis steamer is NOT a magic bullet, and is not worth close to $100. Save yourself the hassle.;this product will NOT hold up to frequent use
59;47.0;1.0;13.0;I thought this machine would be able to clean a bathroom (bath tub, sink, toilet) as others show on TV. It doesn't!! It won't even clean soap stains on my bathtub walls!!! For those who like it, I guess they bought it for a different application... as a cleaning tool, this machine is useless.;Not really what I thought it would be...
14;48.0;1.0;6.0;I purchased a Wagner 905 steamer to clean my tile floors, carpets and bathroom grout.  While I am happy with the products performance, there are quite a few issues with this cheaply made appliance.  My trigger mechanism that attaches to extensions contains a very cheaply made red attachment button that snaps the two pieces together.  This part just broke and fell off while I was cleaning stains on a carpet, and burned my hand.  Unfortunately, the trigger mechanism is attached to the unit's cannister with a hose that is not removable, thus, the whole piece is worthless without a replacement part. My attempts with customer service and driving this unit a half hour away to one of Wagner's service centers seem to be a total waste of time.  Wagner customer service is poor.  I am having to call them, as well as their service center, to attempt to resolve this issue.  Bottom line everyone - a very cheaply made product from China.  If it breaks they will probably have to send out a replacement unit.  DO NOT BUY!!!!;CHEAP HOSE ATTACHMENTS
112;49.0;4.0;15.0;Exactly as described.  It works well, just slowly.  Steaming takes a lot of time.  Quick shipment and it all arrived safely.  Easy to set up and use.;Steamer Review
12;50.0;4.0;5.0;"I bought this machine solely to remove wallpaper which had been applied without anticipation that it would some day have to be removed. Manual methods using liquids and gels are incredibly hard and slow. This steamer does a credible job of softening the paper and adhesive so it can be easily pulled and scraped off with the aid of a plastic scraper. I am well satisfied with it. and wish I had bought it years ago.\n\nI won't repeat the pros and cons mentioned in other reviews. The only beef I have is the difficulty in determining how much water to add after the unit has been turned off a while, cooled down, and then turned back on. One way to insure a full tank before turning it back on is to empty the unit, then add the maximum 48 ounces back in. I find this rather awkward. Instead, I use a dry dowel rod to see how much water remains in the unit. In effect, I constucted a crude sort of ""dipstick,"" but it works O.K. A better way would be for the manufacturer to add a sight gauge or other device to show the number of ounces of cool water left. The appropriate amount of water could then be added to start work again with a full tank.";Good Tool for Wallpaper Removal
17;51.0;5.0;6.0;"I bought the Shark steam mop but haven't been thrilled with the results.  It takes a lot of work to create the steam and even then it's somewhat pitiful.  So I bought this Wagner power steamer and boy is it great!  The steam comes out very powerfully and I have used it to mop tile floors, clean the grout, sanitize my bathroom and kitchen and remove wrinkles in clothes...and that's just a little of what it can do.  My house is cleaner than it's ever been and I'm always thinking of more ways to make use of this, my kids call it ""mom's toy"".  Unlike my vacuum where I never really use the attachments, I use all the attachments with this, it's great.  It has a long hose so you can take it into the shower to clean the walls or easily clean your kitchen counters (none of the Shark steam cleaners can do this easily.)  You just can't go wrong with this product!";Love it!  Much Better Than Shark Steam Mop!
45;52.0;5.0;9.0;"I will start out by saying I'm a terrible over-researcher.  I look at every review for every product before I actually purchase one.  This product exceeded my expectations by far.  After reading a lot of the prior reviews, I was concerned about the quality of the attachments and the ""noise"" that was mentioned in several reviews.  The steam cleaner seemed very sturdy out of the box.  The concern regarding the flimsy attachments seemed unfounded- everything appeared to be good quality and attached well.  I can't imagine it was any noisier than any steam cleaning product would be expected to be. It was a very quick set-up and was ready to go in barely any time at all.\nI tried this steamer on just about everything.  It took grease off the stove, buildup out of the shower and cleaned the upholstery on our couch admirably. I live in an old house and was able to remove what was probably years of built up dirt from small spaces (door frames, crevices in the kitchen, etc) in minutes.  The biggest and best job that I used the steamer for was the floor tile grout in my kitchen.  I had no idea it was so dirty and was shocked to see what the wagner steamed out of my grout!  It took some time but not anywhere near what it would have taken with a wire brush and a bucket.  The job that it did was outstanding!\nI would definitely recommend this product!";So glad we bought it!
65;53.0;5.0;11.0;I wanted something to clean my tile floors.  I settled on Wagner after reading many reviews.  I opened the box, put it together, and in 30 minutes I cleaned two bathrooms (floors, tub, whirlpool, toilets, sinks, showers, countertops) and also the entire grimy kitchen floor.  Super fast, and everything looks pristine.  I hate cleaning, and am also busy. I am thrilled with this purchase.  I love that it is not just a floor mop, because you can do so much more with the attachments.  As for the floor mop pad, yes there is only one, but I am going to cut up an old towel.;Wagner Power Steamer
20;54.0;5.0;6.0;I bought this unit because I have close to 2000 sf of ceramic tile and a recalcitrant little dog.  Best feature for me is the ability to clip a microfiber cloth on the scrubby head I use to steam clean the floors.  I also like the small jet-head type attachment for cleaning the shower door tracks and icky corners.;Fabulous for Tile Floors!
13;55.0;2.0;5.0;The package was good. No damages or anything. Everything was there...nothing missing.\nI was happy that its sturdy&easy to put together. Not really heavy either. You can easily carry it around.\n\nPros:\nThe handle is long enough,even for a tall person,so you don't have to bend down to clean the floors. Attachments are super easy to exchange. Its really sturdy&the cleaning surface is as big as the other major brands. The water tank holds 3cups of water,which lets you steam for a while.\nUsing just the attachments for the bathrooms (brushes&window att.) makes the steam work really good.\n\nCons:\nSo there is a main-steam button you push and a little red one to switch after you pushed the main one down,to lock it into place. Now the prob.with that is that after like a couple minutes it unlocks itself because the water is reheating again. You can still get steam by pushing the button or relocking it but the main steam is getting weak really quick for my opinion. It was annoying.\n\nIve been using it alot&also have to say that the cleaning cloth is not made very well. On mine there are strings coming off already because the base has two snap ons that hold the towels,however the spikes on there are kinda sharp&tears the material apart real quick. And after using it a while for a little,it shrinks and doesnt sit tight on there anymore. So you have to redo it.\n\nAnd maybe others do the same,but this one leaves streaks. Lots of them. Even with a fresh start of a clean cloth. I have wood floor where i can see every single thing. On the tiles i won't see it so much. But i thought it was better then that.\n\nIf you take a break&let it reheat,9 out of 10 times it will spill out a whole lot of water first. It soaked my whole floor...until the steam finally came out..I didn't like that at all. It was so much that even the cloth couldn't soak it up all the way.\n\nAlso,its a guessing thing to know how much water is left in the tank because there is no indicator for that. Only a red light to show you when its reheating and finished reheating the water. BIG NO NO\n\nMy shower windows..well..i tried the attachment and it didn't get the water stains off at all. I was really disappointed in this.\n\nI think the steam is not coming out strong&hot enough because the hose is so long&steam only comes out of the bottom holes.\n\nEverything together:\nIt holds alot of water,its still great to clean around the bathrooms...corners...with the attachments... just for the floors i think its not great. Its okay but it def.could be better. Ild not buy this one again just to get those little things done.\n\nIm sure ill get me a different one,more pricey the next time.\nSorry Wagner but this product should be thought over in many ways to satisfy the costumers in the way they deserve it&in the way it is advertised!!;Ok for the money !!
116;56.0;5.0;14.0;I bought this product to clean grout on a tile floor. It did a great job and is easy to use.;Wagner Power Steamer
83;57.0;4.0;12.0;I had a  different steamer that I liked, but it quit after a year.  I ordered this one to replace it.  It has a bigger tank (will go a LONG time on a refill) so I can do the whole bathroom, shower, mirrors, and tile on one fill. It has a longer hose (a little awkward to store) and extra tools.\n  I really like the trigger for the spray.  My old one just squirted all the time.  This one you can control when and where.\nI really wanted it for my floors, but after trying it on both my hardwood and tile I decided it wouldn't do for mine.  My hardwoods aren't sealed well enough and my tile is older and the finish is worn.  It dulled both floors quickly.\nI like it for my shower, kitchen, windows, patio door, mirrors (keep paper towels handy) and steaming garments.  It rolls easily, but the hose is really long so it's a long way behind you.\nIt's cute, if that counts.  It looks like a little yellow bug.\n  Overall, a quality product that seems like it will last more than a year.  Be sure and use distilled water.  I think that is what did my first steam in.;a wiz
93;58.0;5.0;12.0;"I have to say that I haven't bothered to add many reviews for products/appliances. Usually, we purchase an appliance and expect it to function as described. However, this little steamer has given us a ""wow"". My husband and I have light beige tile floors, with a very pale beige/pink grout (not my choice). Or, the grout was that color when we moved in 10 years ago. Over the past 10 years, 5 dogs, 4 cats, and a penchant for yard work, our grout has suffered. It has suffered to the point of actually looking dark greyish/black in color. We've cleaned it numerous times, employing various methods (all very labor and time intensive, with skin burning chemicals). It still never was clean, or anywhere close to the color we originally had. After reading the reviews of this little steamer, we decided to purchase it, hoping that, if anything, we could clean the grout in a quicker manner. Were we ever pleasantly surprised. This steamer was able to clean our grout in very short order. All that we needed to do was place a brush tip on (with the 2 wand extensions so we didn't even have to bend over), and run the brush tip over the grout several times. And with no more pressure than gravity provided. Add a towel to mop up the excess (not much at all) water, and in a very short period of time, our grout was back to the ORIGINAL color. So, if you have light colored grout, or dirty baseboards (cleaned these ever so well), or pretty much anything that can tolerate steam/water cleaning, this little lovely is a the real deal. WOW!!!!!!";WOW - Great Steamer for the money!!!
15;59.0;5.0;5.0;I used this on an 85 year old house that had 85 years of dirt in the corners.  It is incredible at shooting the grime out of crevices.  Musty pantry doesn't smell musty anymore.  Grimy splashes behind the range are gone.  Soap scum on tile is removed.  Dirt in the corners of old wood windows is gone... some areas look like they've had a new paint job.  Saves a ton of scrubbing time.\n\nI then brought it home and used it on my shower.  It really got rid of the mildew that was deep in the grout, though I had to be patient, and go over it many times over a couple days.  I also used it on carpet stains, with mixed results.\n\nI attempted to used it for removing wallpaper, but the sheetrock hadn't been primed, so it didn't really help with that job.  I also attempted to use it to soften ceiling texture before scraping it off.  I found that using a squirt bottle worked better, because the steamer doesn't really use enough water.  I note this because for cleaning that's a good thing... it uses pressure, not tons of water.\n\nFor cleaning, plan on having old towels or rags.  Shoot an area, wipe, and move on.  It comes with a couple of brushes to attach to the nozzle.  I found for most things it works fine without the brush.\n\nI love this machine, and when it finally wears out, I will promptly buy another!;I use it for everything!
69;60.0;5.0;10.0;I have bought all the other steamers and have returned them because they could not even even compete with soap and water. The Shark should be renamed to Goldfish. Nice to look at, but doesnt do anything. My first impression of the Wagner when it arrived by UPS was that the packaging was very professional. I opened the box, read a small manual, screwed on the bracket, poured water, and turned it on. Within 5 minutes, it was ready to work.\n\nMy first project were my cooking pots with baked on grease and carbon. I could not remove it with just a scrubbing brush.  So I got the Wagner and I attached the metal cleaning brush to the nozzle, and I blasted the pots. It liquefied the dirt. It was so clean.\n\nI next tried it on my Garage floor. I connected the extension handles and the floor cleaner attachment.  It cut through the grime, oil and dirt like a hot knife on butter.  The floor is so shiny!!\n\nWhat I love most is that it has a HUGE tank so that you don't need to keep refilling. I was able to clean 2 bathrooms, 1 garage, and one kitchen, on one full tank of water.\n\nIt is very well made and easy to use so that you will get addicted to cleaning.\n\nUpdate August 18,2009\nBecause of the Bed bugs outbreak, I decided to use the steamer to steam my beddings everyweek just to be sure.  I read that it is the only sure way to kill those nasty bugs.;Cleans almost everything extremely well
16;61.0;5.0;5.0;Purchased from AMAZON.com, it works great on upholstery, first I used it on our microfiber couch.. it lifted stains right up without hassle, then I had used it on our laminate wood flooring and tile... The tile is about 30 years old and it looks like brand new since using this machine. We previously had a Swiffer wet jet and I did not like how wasteful it was with having to replace 3-5 pads after cleaning a couple of rooms and the use of chemicals so when we decided we wanted a steamer this one was our first pick because we can use it on virtually everything... floors, home and auto upholstery, windows\mirrors, bathrooms and kitchen. I based my purchase on the reviews here on amazon. I really don't know why people would give this a one star... it is excellent for household use.;Works great!
54;62.0;5.0;9.0;"I received my Wagner 905 Power Steamer late yesterday.  I got to ""play"" around with it today.  I think with any new ""gadget"" you should take some time (after reading all of the instructions) to become familiar with all functions and/or attachments.\n\nI saw a review where it seemed that the person did not read the instructions fully regarding the filling amounts such as 1 measuring cup (16 oz.) gives you 15 minutes of steam time; 32 oz. gives you 30 minutes and 48 oz. gives you 45 minutes. Another reviewer complained about draining the unit of leftover water.  I turned my unit over my kitchen sink - painless.  You might have to shake the unit around a bit to get the rest of the water out.  Afterwards I would suggest keeping the cap off and the lid open for a day or so for full evaporation.  Distilled water is a must.\n\nAnother reviewer suggested having lots of cloths available and he wasn't kidding.  Yet another reviewer said he peeled his paint but if you keep the unit at a decent distance you can get difficult splatters off of your walls and wood cabinets too.\n\nI started off with the nozzle brushes and then switched to the jet nozzle.  No big problem except that I found out that if the unit sits for a minute or two a stream of very hot water will flow out (like a squirt gun) before the steam resumes.  Condensation collection I guess.  I had to laugh at myself as it seemed like such a ""Polish moment"" (I'm Polish and quite typical of me - really!).\n\nNext I tried attaching the extensions to the unit so I could steam clean my rugs and drapes but the parts just wouldn't fit together.  It turns out there must be some swelling from the heat and the end should be fully cooled down first.\n\nI actually bought this unit for steam cleaning my rugs and drapes and have to say that I am beyond happy.  I have a large clothing steamer that I would drag around and on my hands and knees steam clean my rugs and drapes a couple of times a year.  It was really a pain in the knees (the butt was fine)!  The Wagner 905 is just so much better and convenient with a decent sized cord (I actually had to use a heavy duty extension cord to reach all around the house without unplugging the unit several times.) and long steam hose (what a bonus).  I love the extensions for reaching the top of my drapes.  My home smells so fresh now.  A bonus(???) - I saw some spiders coming, literally, out of the woodwork.  They have some great hiding places I wasn't aware of.  Another bonus is the disinfection I get without harsh chemicals.\n\nThe only downside is that the unit doesn't have a handle or pull cord to move the unit around easily.  I guess I'll think of something.\n\nCan't wait to get upstairs and try it on our bedding and around our shower stall.\n\nHappy cleaning!!!!";SMELLING CLEAN AND FRESH
94;63.0;5.0;11.0;I was looking to purchase a steamer to remove wallpaper in every room of the house we just bought when I came across this one.  I didn't think I'd need all the extra attachments, although I will now definitely be using them for other household jobs.  The steamer is amazing.  It heats fairly quickly.  The best feature is the trigger, which allows you to control when the steam comes out, compared to a rented steamer or the cheaper Wagner steamer which just steams constantly creating a huge mess on the floor.  I also like that the unit has wheels so it rolls along with you when you move.;Great steamer for a great price
25;64.0;4.0;6.0;I love everything about this Power Steamer.  One thing really bugs me though.  The red snap mechanism that pops up to connect and hold the extension wand in place kept popping off.  I put it back on several times.  The last time I could not find the little spring that makes the button pop out.  Now steam comes out of the little hole but the wand still stays attached without it.\n\nAll in all it is well worth the money even it I only use it for the kitchen floor.  I have gone through two Bissle Steam mops.  Neither cleaned as well and they both stopped working before a year was up.;Power Steamer
19;65.0;5.0;5.0;I have to say I have never written a review in my life but I just had to share with everyone what a great machine this is. First the only assmebling you have to do is the handle which they even provide the screwdriver for you. Next just snapping on the attachments you want to use. I mostly bought it for the job I hate the most which is cleaning my bathroom. My vinyl floors were a mess with stuck on hair spray which usually takes alot of muscle power to get up but with this machine it didn't take any effort at all, I was amazed. My floors have never looked so sparkling! That alone was worth the purchase for me! Next I moved onto the shower and once again with barely any effort it got up the hard water stains & grime. The only 2 downsides for me is that the instruction manual could have described the best use for each attachment & the task of finding storage space the the unit and all the attachments, but that's it. I highly recommend it if you hate cleaning as much as I do.;Fantastically Easy!
27;66.0;5.0;6.0;After reading a number of consumer product reviews, we bought the Wagner steamer and were not disappointed.  I was able to clean my entire kitchen, including the floor, counter, stove, range hood, sink and frig exterior in about an hour.  It was amazingly easy, requiring little elbow grease, and really came clean.  I love the fact that no cleaning supplies were necessary other than the cleaner, water and some paper towels.  I have arthritis and this makes cleaning practically effortless for me.\n\nTHe machine is extremely easy to use and a nice, portable size.  The cord and hose are both long enough to do the one room easily.  It comes with a number of very practical attachments that work very well. My one negative comment is that the steamer doesn't come with any type of case or carry-all to hold the attachments.  We found something that would work, but it would have been nice to have that included in the package.\n\nI think anyone who bought this cleaner would be very happy with it.  I know I am!;Fantastic cleaning tool

I did find myself wondering around the house looking for something new to clean.  Even though it's not a handheld unit, it's easy to use and put away.  The only negative thing I can say about it is that I wish the steam evaporated after using it...you do have to wipe up the water.  The reason I bought it was to clean some windows that had mold and dirt on them in a house that was not lived in for a year that I was remodeling.  It did a great job.";suited my  needs
87;68.0;5.0;10.0;I recently purchased this steamer, and it did an excellent job of cleaning my floors. Next, I decided to tackle the shower which I do not clean on a regular basis. I steamed it, then scrubbed and steamed again, and months of soap build up rinsed right off. The construction is sturdy, and it can be used for so many more functions than the regular floor steamers.  I highly recommend this top notch product!;An excellent product!
33;69.0;5.0;6.0;"This steamer works great. I bought it for general household cleaning.  I've read reviews that state the steam doesn't get hot enough, well mine does.  I would definitely allow time to heat the tank, especially if you fill it full.  It does get loud, but considering the end result of cleaning, it's only a small annoyance. For those of you that have concerns with the lack of different attachments, they do exist.

Steamfast states they aren't when you call them, but Wagner says they are, and I took a chance and ordered more terry cloth replacements, and extra scrubbers (like a round plastic brillo pad) and they fit perfect onto the nozzle. The Terry Cloth from Steamfast even came in the same plastic bag packaging as the Wagner model.  PLEASE NOTE- The floor attachment on the Steamfast model has changed within the last 2 months- so the terry cloth might be a different size since my Wagner purchase.\n\nI'm very happy with this purchase, and I will eventually use the wallpaper attachment, which is something the other ""brands"" don't have. So you can buy the other name models to get the attachments you want at a higher $$, or get this one and order any additional/extra parts from Steamfast folks as needed. You have to call to order- the website randomnly works, and it's hard to get the part numbers/pictures).\n\nRemember this is an alternate to using chemicals, or an enhancement when used with using cleaning products (like removing residue). It is not a PRESSURE WASHER! I have a feeling a lot of negative reviews are expecting a jet-engine strength volume of steam. There is a lot of steam, and it works, but it won't peel paint off, maybe melt it with over exposure.  I even took a chance and used it on a wooden cabinet drawer to remove a red wine stain! After the wine stain melted away I put lemon oil on my cabinet and it is as if it never was stained.";Great steamer for cleaning!
21;70.0;5.0;5.0;I tell everyone that this machine is like cleaning crack!  It is addicting to be a grime buster and I love this product.  I came home one day to find my blessed housekeeper totally amped with the new steamer she had bought.  I ordered one for my home and it came superfast, ordered Thur. or Fri. and received by Sunday, though may have come Sat. as it was found on the front porch.\nI am an evangelist for this product, and said I should get a bunch & go door to door with them.  Cleaning the frig and the vents below was a breeze.  If anyone moves into a pre-owned home and doesn't use this to sanitize the previous owners grime, well....I'm just saying....\nI'm using the distilled water as we have extremely hard water and I want it to last.;"Cleaning ""crack""  Love it!"
95;71.0;5.0;10.0;The best tool I've ever bought in terms of its time savings over alternative products.  I tried chemical strippers (sprays, gels) first.  They were a nightmare.  This steamer made short work of a job that was taking many hours longer than it should have, and left my walls in much better condition than strippers.  Only used it for wallpaper so far, but tested the jet nozzle and was impressed by the steam pressure.  Only improvement would be a water separator and reclaim system to prevent dripping from condensate buildup in the hose.;Bad job made easy
46;72.0;1.0;7.0;Do NOT believe all the wonderful reviews about this machine.  It is absolutely useless.  I read all the great things people are saying about this piece of trash and was eagerly awaiting for it to arrive to get some serious cleaning done.  Trust me, you're much better off just using one of the small hand held steamers than this thing.  It does NOT clean a damned thing.  In fact, I held the unit withing 6 inches of my hand and only felt a little warm.  Before I actually used it, I was concerned about sopping up all the residual water like I did with my hand-held unit, but, OMG, what a joke.  There's no residual water.  Hardly anything at all comes out.  The towel attached to it just barely gets moist, let alone wet.  I WILL be returning this junk.  VERY, VERY DISSAPPOINTED.  Yellow really is the appropriate color for this LEMON. Either I got a lemon, or, there's some underhanded marketing guys planting a bunch fake reviews here, either way I got hosed.;Extremely dissappointed
47;73.0;1.0;7.0;After much research bought to help tackle our disgusting short sale purchase. It can't compete, at all, with a bottle of simple green or similar product and a little elbow grease. Stove? No. Grout? No. Crayons on walls? No. Scale on faucets? No.\n\nAfter it melted it's own cleaning brush tip, I boxed it back up and set it out for trash day. What waste of money and time. You have been warned!;Terrible. Does not work.
34;74.0;2.0;6.0;If you are planning to use this steamer other than wallpaper like those pictures show, this is not for you. Steam is so weak and not hot enough that I can almost put it on my finger...\nOnly good thing is Amazon's easy returning process and that's why I gave 2 stars, instead of 1!;Good for only wallpaper!
23;75.0;4.0;5.0;"I bought this a few months ago and I love using it. The first project was cleaning the grout on my tile floor. It still took some scrubbing and ammonia but flushing it out with the steam cleaner made the grout super clean. I clean my tile and hardwood floors every week with it and it does a much better job than a mop. We never use the mop anymore! You can see the dirt come off onto the cloth. It gives off more than enough steam for my projects. It is easy to use and compact to store. I really like using it and am becoming a cleaning freak with it. However, I tried it on my grill but found that it took too long. Using a garden hose, cleaning solution, and a large grill brush was much faster.\n\nSome design cons; 1) the swiveling wheel on the unit is at the back instead of the front so it bangs into furniture and walls when I pull it along by the hose. It is most annoying to me. 2) there is no way to wind up the cord so I have to use a rubber band. The cord could be another 6 ft longer. 3) the towel it comes with is hardly adequate. You'll have to buy more or improvise with rags. 4) I wish it also came with a medium size brush head. 5) After 3 months the ""O"" rings to the handle broke and fell off allowing steam to escape between the handle and any attachment you attach to it. I called customer service right away and the rep arranged to send me a couple of replacement rings, no questions asked. When I returned to the unit I discovered the leaking steam must have melted the attachment release button on the handle and it just fell out. I called customer service again and another rep arranged to send me an entire replacement handle, again with no questions asked. I was very impressed with the easy service, but I also wondered if broken ""O"" rings with subsequent damage to the handle were a common problem, and that is why there was no questions asked about how old the unit was. Nonetheless, once I get the replacement parts I'm excited about going back to cleaning with it.\n\nUpdate: The replacement parts came within a couple of days. It is working fine but after 4 months of use I noticed the  extension tubes flexing more when I need to scrub my floor more firmly. Sometimes I worry about them breaking at the joints so I have ease off the pressure. They should be more sturdy.";I love using it!
82;76.0;5.0;9.0;I was looking for a steam mop for my tile and grout (especially grout). Always took hours with bleach and scrub brush on grout due to having mostly tile in my house. I found this item to have really good reviews and it does so much more than just floors for the similar amount of money. I am soooo glad I bought it. Not only has my floors and grout been so clean, but my counters and showers and jacuzzi tub. I look for things to clean. The amount of steam is awesome. My granite is sparkly and the real test was the handles on my oven. I could never get the grime off and in minutes it was gone. This is by far my best purchase, it is my new best friend;amazing product
37;77.0;5.0;6.0;This is some of the best money I have ever spent.  I am in the process of preparing my house for sale and doing my prepatory cleaning.  After 7 years in habitation with a 4 year old and a dog, there is grim in corners etc.  This product has cut through the ick in no time and made my work so easy.  I would recommend this to anyone.  I previously tried the shark model and was disappointed, it would be fine for daily or weekly light cleaning, but not for that yearly(or so...) power clean.  If you have rental properties or flip houses, this would also be very useful.  The one caveat is if you have small children, be very careful.  This looks like a toy to them with the bright color and wheels and could burn them very badly if they got a hold of it, Wagner might consider a safety lever on the steamer handle as a possible improvement on future models.  Overall an excellent, well designed and exceptionally useful product. Whish I had had one of these when I was doing my last remodel!;I am in love
49;78.0;4.0;7.0;"..since others have written most of what I'd say about this machine, I'd like to recommend buying (on Amazon, of course) a 24 pack of plain, white shop (14"" z 17"") towels to go with it. The best way to clean with the steamer is to spray and wipe, spray and wipe. There is very little water to mop up, as it is so hot (it's steam) most evaporates at once. However, the junk being cleaned up needs to go somewhere! The towels can be washed and reused many times, yet are cheap enough to toss after a really yucky job, such as grill grease. Trust me, you will use/need these.\n\nAs for the steamer, I love it. Just as with others reviewing, I find myself looking around for more things to clean. It's wonderful for cracks and crevices like around drains and fixtures, edges of floors and tiles, window tracks, etc. It can force out that stuff you can never reach, even with tooth brushes and tweezers! I am also happy about not needing (and I will save a lot not buying) chemical cleaners. I recommend this for those with allergies and chemical sensitivities.\n\nI subtract one star only for design, It really needs a handle of some sort. It rolls easily, and the cord seems very sturdy, so one pulls it around by the power cord like a toddler's choo-choo toy. But that is awkward and I dislike the idea of using a power cord for other than transmitting electricity. Pulling from the steam hose is also an option, but again, it's awkward and I dislike the idea of putting the stress on a transmission conduit. One also wants to lift it without using both hands to scoop from underneath. Why they designed it without a simple handle is a mystery! That said, it's easy enough, even fun to use. I wish I'd bought one years ago.";Buy shop towels to compliment this....
40;79.0;5.0;6.0;"The 905 is a steam machine designed for home use; not industrial capacity. It does everything claimed and does it exactly as illustrated. It is what I expected. When it stopped working, still under warranty, I reread the manual and called Wagner for help. I described the failure to produce steam and they understood immediately. They  replaced the machine with a new one within four days. Since this type of situation can happen to any product, I was extremely impressed, favorably, with Wagner Customer Service. Just Great. Thank you, Wagner, for a great product, great value, and great service when I needed it.";Great Product Greater Company
114;80.0;5.0;10.0;The steamer does more than I was expecting it to do, it is a must have product.;Hot New Product
42;81.0;5.0;6.0;"First, I am very impressed with the quality of this steam cleaner.  From the moment I opened the box, it was one of the most excellently packaged products, and as I pulled each piece out each part was so solid & well built.  I was really impressed by the construction of the unit.  The main unit itself seems so solid and tight.  The cap for the steam chamber fits so snugly and easily screwed and unscrewed with its brass threads.  It is clearly ready to build a lot of pressure.  Where I expected some cheap parts, such as with the hose and extensions, they are clearly very heavy duty.  The extensions to turn into a floor mop were heafty when I expected cheap plastic.  I was impressed.  The hose was quite long too.  One funny thing not shown in the picture is that there is nowhere to coil the hose and it is much more than you see in the picture.  It helps you reach places easily.  But you will have to just coil the hose around the unit or something.\n\nYou can fill it for up to 55 minutes of continuous steam, but it claims it can run further depending on attachment.  It takes 5-15 minutes to heat up depending on how much water you put in.  I just turn it on and do something else and come back and it is ready.  Then it can run steam continuously at least until you want to move it to another location further from the plug.  With the long hose you can reach a lot of places.  But due to the power needs the power cord will not let you use it all over your house without unplugging and moving it.  However you can easily do just that, unplug, move it, plug back in, and it maintains nearly all of its heat and steam in the move and is ready nearly instantly.\n\nIt does hold onto heat and steam for a while, so when you are done, you turn off, unplug, and have to empty the steam into a sink, and wait at least 15 minutes before opening the cap because even the cap itself will be extremely hot.  So to refill if you need more, you will have to wait, so fill with enough to do your cleaning, and consider taking a break if you need more to cool down, refill, and heat back up.  You also have to empty the unit after use.  This is primarily because it gives you dire warnings not to overfill and you wouldn't know how much water was in it already.  The measuring cup to fill is well marked, gives you the run time and fill lines, and is easy to fill the unit without spilling.  Emptying the unit requires you to lift and turn upside down over a sink, which is slightly awkward, but not troublesome.  There is no separate drain, probably due to the precision needed to limit holes to maintain steam in the chamber.  You can run the unit dry and it is designed to overhead and automatically shut off and is supposed to reset automatically after cooling, but you know when you out of steam and can just stop on your own.  I've run it dry, but didn't wait for it to shut itself down.\n\nAs for cleaning, it definitely helped me clean some things easily, but still doesn't perform miracles.  It easily got some spots off the lenolium floor that my swiffer and other Shark steam mop couldn't pick up and got some rust off a glass shower door.  It could completely clean test sections of my very marked up & dirty kitchen lenolium with some scrubbing for a while, but it probably took off the finish too, so I am still just testing that.  It took a lot of elbow work out of removing grime from kitchen tile backsplash.  It didn't work instantly, but with some reasonable motion of the attachment brush on the tile while taking turns to wipe away and rub with a dry towel it cleaned 100 times faster than soap and water that I tried on the same area a week before.  I also steamed some really dirty horizontal blinds and worked wonders on them with about 20 minutes of cleaning.  I had to use the nosel directly against it and it melted off much of the grime, but I think the blinds were already permanently marked up by age anyway, so there are still some spots.  But it did wonders on the blinds, if done carefully.  I steamed directly against them a few rows at a time while wiping with a towel.  Be very careful not to burn yourself by accidentally wiping while you are still steaming.  I used the scrubber on tough sections.  They are not new again, but a ton better.\n\nSo I am happy with the unit.  It is excellently constructed, and makes some jobs a lot easier physically.  I didn't try the floor attachment yet.  I am happy with my Shark Steam mop for normal mopping between swiffering.  The Shark heats in 30 seconds and is better suited for routine cleaning I think.  This is my unit for hard core twice a year cleaning.\n\nUPDATE: I tried the floor attachment.  It works, but doesn't seem as easy as and doesn't clean any better than my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shark-Deluxe-Steam-Pocket-Mop-S3501/dp/B0028MB3HM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shark Deluxe Steam Pocket Mop, S3501</a>.  For floors, I much prefer just picking up my Shark Deluxe steam mop which does an equal or better job on floors, but feels faster & easier.  With this, you wrap a pad or towel they give you around a brissle-based brush with some strong clamps to hold the towel on.  It seems a lot more rigid because it wraps around some really hard brissles and did not work miricles, but did pick up stuff.  I did go back with the nossle attachment and tried to scrub my whole floor, which is an impossible job and really damages the lenolium.  They tell you not to scrub hard on non-tile anwyay.  So I am still happy with my purchase, I will just use it for certain cleaning tasks that it is a lot better at than floors.";Very Impressed with Quality, Great Job but not Miracles
73;82.0;5.0;8.0;I originally just wanted a steam mop, but did research on all products...that's where I came across this product.  I received it sooner than expected and have not been disappointed!  I consider myself a bit of a clean fanatic, but did not realize how much dirt was still in my home.  I have used this steamer for so much more than my stone floors!  My sinks, tub and tile/glass shower now look brand new!  I had not realized how much hard water buildup was dulling them. Also, I live ocean-front and have LOTS of windows.  The salt spray causes a film that I used to spend hours trying to clean.  This machine accomplished that in a fraction of the time and with much better results!  FANTASTIC PRODUCT!;WORTH EVERY PENNY!
53;83.0;3.0;7.0;This steam cleaner does a great job but I do see some minor opportunities for improvement.  Number 1 the steam confuses me a little.  I was expecting a massive burn when I ran it across my arm by accident however I found the steam to feel more like a hot water vapor.  Number 2  It definitely needs to be more pressurized.  It takes a lot of elbow grease to accomplish jobs that this was supposed to make easier because there is not much pressure.  I will say that it did a wonderful job on the tile and grout in the bathroom.;Great item but could be better
28;84.0;2.0;5.0;After much research & deliberation, I purchased this unit based on the mostly glowing reviews. I'm not sure if my expectations were too high, or I received a faulty steamer, but it definitely takes a LOT of elbow grease to remove anything with this steamer. I've tried it on my stove & that area around my stove fan-I cleaned the area first with Fantastik, then thought the steamer might get the baked on grease stains. Nope. I tried it on my shower door with soap scum--no luck there. It did a passable job on my floors, but not near as good as my Eureka Envirosteamer--which is built for steaming floors. I tried to use it to remove some paint that had dried on my tile, nothing. And I could scrape up the paint without the steamer! It gives off steam, but much more hot water, which is great for disinfecting, I suppose--but I want cleaning power too! I thought perhaps it needed to calibrate, so I kept using it, but at this point I'm going to take it into the local service center to see if it is defective--and if not, back to Amazon it goes!\n\nGreat concept, but mine doesn't seem up for the work.;Hot water & a bit 'o steam
29;85.0;5.0;5.0;"A great steamer for household cleaning and sanitizing!\n\nThe Wagner 905 steamer is a great unit for household cleaning and sanitizing.  It cleans grease, stains and grit off most kitchen and bathroom surfaces with power to spare.  I used it to clean the yellow age stains off bathroom linoleum and kitchen floor tiles and the calcium buildup on bathtub surfaces.  It works well removing built up grease off the stove top as well as other nasty jobs that liquid detergents just will not clean.  I never tried removing wall paper, though there is a dedicated attachment for the task.  It is very light and portable and seems very well made.\n\nThe differences between the Wagner 905 and the so-called ""hand-held"" steamers advertised on TV are dramatic.  The Wagner's 48 ounce water tank will give you more than enough steam to clean an 8' x 10' kitchen floor or a 5' x 7' bathroom linoleum floor.  I locked the handle in the `CONSTANT STEAM' position and the pressure and steam kept strong throughout cleaning.  Occasionally the a red light would illuminate indicating the steam pressure was low and the unit was recovering but I never noticed any difference in the steam flow and the recovery process lasted for only a few seconds.  It takes about 15 minutes or less to bring the water up to steam after (re)filling and I always finished the task before running out of steam.\n\nBe aware that the Wagner is not a pressure washer or a carpet cleaner.  The pressure is adequate to do most home cleaning and you can get out some small carpet stains but do not confuse it with the $1,500 plus units used to clean automobile engines, concrete and siding.\n\nIf you are looking for a portable steamer for household use the Wagner 905 is a very good choice.";A great steamer for household cleaning and sanitizing!
48;86.0;5.0;6.0;First, I have looked at I think every steam cleaner on the market in the under $200 range.  I didn't have that much to spend so I just didn't look above that price point.  First I saw three different infomercials which I have to say I don't believe much but I wanted to see some of these products in action.  Then I've gone to countless websites looking at reviews including here on Amazon.com.  I had not even heard of the Wagner Power Steamer until I ended up at Costco this weekend and they had 4 in stock and it was on sale for $54.99.  I thought well I don't know anything about it but I've been looking for a steamer and with very limited funds (I really wanted to spend $100 or less) I thought I'll bring it home, not open it until I read as many reviews as possible.  After reading reviews here - mostly positive - and reviews on other websites I decided to open the sealed box and dig in.  First, it was so simple.  I followed the directions and had no problems assembling the parts (which I think it as like 3 steps to start).  I filled it half full (it holds a whopping 48 oz of water) and waited 12 minutes for it to heat up.  In that 12 minutes I swept and vaccumed.  I got 2 pet stains out of the carpet in minutes.  I have vinyl flooring in the kitchen which it cleaned beautifully.  I also had some baseboards in the corners which were hideously dirty and after a blast of steam, wiped with a towel, were perfectly clean.  One of the problems I've heard of with floor steam cleaners that they leave puddles of water on the floor.  Not the Wagner, I swear I wore my leather loafers while cleaning the kitchen and it was virtually dry as I went.  I never even slipped around.  There was something gummy on the floor and it melted it away.  Around the stove was some cooking oil spatters right around the base of the stove which I hadn't even notice until the steam hit it and melted it right away.  One BIG advantage about the Wagner is that you don't need to buy their cleaning pads.  It came with one and I found that my white terry dish towels fits it perfectly and it holds it on with clamps.  And I can wash them over and over.  I also bought the white terry towels at Costco months ago (in the automotive shop section).  So while you can buy it on Amazon - it really doesn't matter where you buy it you can use any pad that will fit.  It comes with several attachments which I have used several already.  I cleaned the toilet, sink, baseboards and carpet stains with the wand.  I cleaned the kitchen floor with the floor attachment.  It even has a squeegee for windows and mirrors which I have not used yet.  The bonus is that if you need to remove wallpaper it also has a wallpaper remover.  I don't have wallpaper but it's a nice bonus.  Overall, I think this is the best deal going.  The floor type steam cleaners do not have the wand, squeegee attachment and I have read they do not clean spots off the carpet well if at all.  One thing is that it made so much steam that I felt like I'd had a facial in the end, not a bad thing but it did make alot of steam.;Best Steam Cleaner I've found!
81;87.0;1.0;8.0;I bought mine mainly for cleaning my kitchen tiles.  The first day I used it, I was a bit disappointed that it took a lot of scrubing to actually remove the grime.  The second day I used it, it smoked and set off my fire alarm.  I thought maybe that was a fluke but the third day I used it, it smoked enough to make the alarm go off so long that I had to pull it down and take the battery out.  I'm returning it.  I still haven't finished cleaning the kitchen tiles after 3x using it so that should give you an idea of how long it takes to actually scrub the grime off.\nI'm planning on buying either the McCulloch or Steamfast, which look pretty much just like the Wagner.  Hopefully they won't smoke.  I'd like to buy a better steamer but don't have $600 to spend on one right now.;It set off my smoke alarm.
109;88.0;5.0;9.0;Bought the steamer for removing plastic coated wallpaper and it does a fantastic job. But it helps to perforate the wallpaper first with another tool. When I was struggling on removing some vinyl floor tiles with a hammer and chisel, decided to try the Wagner steamer. After holding the large wallpaper attachment over a tile for 30 seconds, I was able to literally lift the whole tile up with a scraper cause it melted the tile adhesive.\nWear gloves, the tiles are hot. I'll definitely recommend this steamer for many household cleaning tasks.;Removing vinyl floor tiles too
61;89.0;4.0;7.0;My only complaints are small ones.\n\n1. The steam doesn't last long enough for the multiple tasks I have to do from time to time. About 30-40 min of steam.\nThen you must wait for the unit to cool before adding more water, which can take some hours.\n\n2. The burst isn't completely consistent beyond several minutes.\nMeaning that you will need to stop for a minute & then resume.\n\nOther than these minor annoyances, it works & works well.\nRemoved very difficult grime from areas that have been impossible to reach.\nI have used it to detail some rather filthy cars.\nCars with parents who allow their precious rugrats to do anything they wish, which results in some very messy, sticky, caked on areas to clean.\nThis lifted everything.\n\nI also found that if you prep upholstery with this unit to loosen dirt, & then use your bissel, it really gets any deep dirt right out of there.\n\nUsed on my outdoor furniture, also to blast dust out of my window screens, & to clean my blinds. did a very nice job.;Works very well
70;90.0;5.0;7.0;I read many reviews on several steamer products.  This had the best reviews overall (and the best price).  I took the leap of faith thinking that the bad reviews were just from high expectations or bad luck.\n\nThis has been a great purchase for me!\n\nI've used it to clean my shower.  The hard water stains and soap scum come right off.  Much easier and no chemicals.  Same with the sink and toilet.  I like how it gets in the seams.  It cleaned a few areas that have never been cleaned before.\n\nI used it on the inside of my car.  It really helped clean that plastic surface on the dash board, doors, and especially the center gear shifter that had a coating of something on it.  I was amazed at how much black stuff was coming off of everything and now my car is a lighter shade inside.  I'm pretty sure this would clean the tires but didn't have time to get them all the way clean.\n\nThe best use has been for the wall paper.  I score the wall paper, steam for 10 seconds, peel off whole sections of the decorative section, then score the adhesive that is left, steam for 10 seconds or until it is wet, then scrape easily (and sometimes pull off whole sections again).  We tried scraping without the steamer and it is just ridiculous.  I recommend long sleeves and workers gloves so the water does not drip and burn you.  Also expect some water on the floor.\n\nThe machine itself is very quiet.  It only has a loud pitch when you trigger the steam.  I recommend ear plugs in small spaces.\n\nAnd last of all, you could probably spot clean carpet very well with this especially for recent spills.  But this isn't really built to deep clean carpets effectively in my opinion.\n\nI'd say this is a must have for a new home owner like I am.  It's been great with the cleaning and saved hours.  Our friends have told us stories about wallpaper and are also amazed at how easy this things makes it.\n\nI have so many more things to try out with this.;Multi Use Cleaner and Time Saver
35;91.0;5.0;5.0;I got this a couple of weeks ago, but just tried it today and tackled one of my hardest areas to clean.  The bathroom tile floor circa 1964.  The machine was easy to assemble by reading the directions as in what attaches where and how.  I filled it all the way and waited about 5 minutes or so for it to be ready.  It never ran out of pressure and steam, never fizzled, never failed for about an hour.  I got a lot of the dirtiest grout clean, but I knew I needed more time to really do the job.  I have no doubt that once I get it fully cleaned, it will stay clean with weekly use.  I just have one caution.  I've used bleach in the past and could detect bleach in the steam as it came off the floor. I've used another steam mop in there several times, but it must have been down in the grout.  you might want to use safety glasses and a nose mask the first time, cause this bad boy is going to bring back the past.  I'm going to attack wallpaper border next.  I'm sure it will do the job.  I'm very happy with this product.\n\nUpdate a few months later.  Still loving it.  I used it to soften 5 year old tub caulk.  I steamed sections, then pulled it away with a paint scraper.  Without the steamer, I don't know how I would have gotten it off.\nThis machine is not a magic wand.  For the really old, hardened messes, you'll have to put some work into it.  But not as much as you would without it!;Very Happy
38;92.0;4.0;5.0;I love to clean things, and I have long wanted a steam cleaner.  This one is pretty good, but I am a little bit disappointed with the power of the steam spray.  I can't say I know of one that works better, and I'm happy enough with it that I will definitely keep it.  I used it to detail the areas around the doors when I washed my car--you know, the parts inside that don't ever show except when the doors are standing open--and it worked great.  It loosened up all the gunky stuff (including algae--I live in the rainy part of Oregon and my car is parked outside all year) so I could just wipe it away with a rag, without making anything too wet.  I used it on the kitchen stove, but I think I still like chemical cleaners better. It worked great for sanitizing and cleaning the unreachable parts of the commode that I usually go after with a toothbrush and spray cleaner (like where the seat bolts on and around the base at the floor) in the bathroom, as well as chasing out anything that accumulates around the sink molding and places like that.  If you like to clean windows that way, I think it does a great job.  I tried it, but I still prefer an old fashioned squeegee with rags, and/or a good microfiber glass cloth, since they are lighter to carry around and less awkward to work with, which equals: faster.  So, for the price, I think it's a good item to have around, but it isn't the end-all for cleaning that the ads will lead you to believe.  I'm always looking for the best cleaning chemicals and tools, and I'd say this one rates about a five on a scale of one to ten.;Good but not the killer cleaning machine I'd hoped for
41;93.0;3.0;5.0;I was so excited when I ordered this product, because the reviews made it sound like a wonder-machine.  It does clean my tile floor, but it is a lot of work.  I have to keep going over the area and it leaves waster on the floor. (It also occaisionally trips my breaker.) It has gotten some of my grout clean, but I still have not achieved the original color.  It is quiet, and warms up pretty quickly, but I don't think the steam time is as long as the directions claim it is.  It does do an awesome job on the shower and bathtub.  I am not sorry I bought the machine, but it is not the wonder-machine that some of the reviews claim it is.;It's ok.
77;94.0;5.0;7.0;After using a rental wall paper steamer one weekend, based on amount of wall paper I had to remove, I decided to buy my own steamer. There is not much to choose from and I bought the Wagner. It is a great product! It removed wall paper easily and had much less drip that the rental, perhaps due to the steam trigger. The unit is small and lightweight. Out of curiosity, I cleaned my bathroom tile with it and was shocked by how much grim came away. The floors seemed clean before. I was also able to truly clean the grooves on the top of my shower doors (yuck!).\n\nThere were a few delightful surprises in the box:\n-measuring cup\n-funnel\n-wheels on bottom\n-floor cleaning cloth\n-it even included a screw driver for the single screw to attach the handle\n\nPros\n-easy to use thanks to steam trigger and attachments\n-lightweight\n-steams well with good pressure\n-wheels\n-exceptional packaging and attachments\n-not bad looking\n\nCons\n-tank only holds 3 cups of water (plenty for my jobs), but you cannot see the water level so must turn unit upside down to drain leftover water before refilling for another big job.\n-storing all the attachments;Great design, thoughful touches, works great

57;96.0;5.0;6.0;I purchased this product based on all the reviews I read.  It is just as good as everyone posted.  I cleaned all the tile in my bathroom first. Everything is now clean and sparkling. The unit was easy to use following the directions and very lightweight. Much easier than getting down on the floor and scrubbing with bleach products getting less results.  There are attachments for just about everything you want to clean.  This is a great product for the price.  I am happy I purchased it and I am going to recommend it to all my friends.;I just received this item and now my bathroom sparkles.
58;97.0;5.0;6.0;I've had this machine a couple of months now and I really love it.  My favorite uses for it so far are cleaning the bathroom and my tile floor.  I take everything out of my bathroom (soap dispensers on the counters, shampoo in the shower,etc..) and then I just blast steam on everything.  The bottom of my shower floor never looked so clean.  It does take some extra scrubbing the first time because you don't realize how much soap scum is built up until you actually get on your hands and knees and really look!  The steamer helps to get all the stuff loose and then you can get a scrubber sponge and get the rest out.  Same with the counter tops, bathtub and comode.  My bathrooms have linoleum and they were just gross.  I hate linoleum!  Did a great job getting those clean, although the heat took off the wax finish, but I don't care.  I can mop that back on.  It did an awesome job on my tile floor.  I have about 1000 square feet of tile in my house.  My tile has groves in it and dirt gets trapped in side.  It takes time to steam each one the first time, but I was able to get all the dirt out of the grooves and now I just use the floor feature everytime I want to clean the floor.  Haven't mopped or used chemicals on the floor or in the bathroom since I got this little beauty!  Can't wait to try it on other things!;This machine makes you love to clean!
86;98.0;4.0;7.0;I purchased this after reading the reviews.  I am a male living alone and really hate cleaning but after a week of having people over the house is a disaster.  This machine made cleaning the stove so easy I couldn't believe it.  It worked 10 times better than the clorox stove top cleaner.  I used it in the shower and it did a great job there too.  On my floor it did a good job of getting off beer spills and dirt. It didn't do a good job of getting off the black marks left by peoples shoes.  That still required scrubbing with a brush.  The unit is very quiet.  The reviews about being loud come from the pressure spray attachment.  It is very loud just like the sprayers at a car wash.  I didn't find it so loud that I was uncomfortable and it does such a good job you don't notice the noise when the grime starts to disappear right before your eyes.;Worked great for me
64;99.0;5.0;6.0;I have a large home with lots of stuff to clean. I used this on my stainless steel refrigerator and it came out unbelievable (I used the pad and just steamed it). Normally it takes me 30-45 minutes to clean it and get all the steaks out (will never buy stainless again!) I LIGHTLY steam the walls and baseboards in no time (I also use the pad and even made some of my own with dish towels). I clean the window sills and even use the pad to steam the glass to remove all the dust and then use windex. Love this, makes things much easier on me!;Best thing I ever bought!
66;100.0;2.0;6.0;This machine was purchased for steam cleaning, and not for taking down wall paper.\nI Hated it!!!  It puts out way too much condensation and not enough force to actually clean anything!  I tried to clean my bathroom with it, and it was so lacking in power, nothing budged: soap scum, mildew, NOTHING! It was just like I took hot water and sprayed it with a spray bottle. By the time I was done trying, my whole bathroom was fogged up, but it felt like I didn't 'clean' anything.\nThe only good thing, but could be also considered a negative, is the size of the machine.  It takes a lot of water, and will run for a very long time.  Because of this, it is also very cumbersome to move around.\nBottom line: I returned this item and purchaed a hand held Scunci.  I love it, I zip all around the house with it and blast the heck out of all the grudge I find.  It is also great for steam sterilizing my daughter's toys. Very powerful and lightweight.  Also, it doesn't take too much water, which you should know to ALWAYS used distilled water.  I feel like I have just enough steam to run throught the house and sterilize everything.;Poor cleaning machine

100;103.0;4.0;7.0;I bought this steamer on the recommendation of my pest control officer as we are currently dealing with bedbugs.  I have used it to steam my furniture and carpet to kill the bugs and as far as I can tell it's been very effective.  I can't comment, therefore, on the uses it's intended for, like wall paper stripping.  It's very easy to use and has lots of useful attachments.  My only gripe would be that it does spit water, but under most circumstances I'm sure that wouldn't affect what you're doing.  All in all very pleased.;An effective wet steamer
72;104.0;5.0;6.0;"Since I now live in Guam I could not get this shipped here, but went to the new Home Depot and special ordered it for $150.00!\nI hated the 8 week wait for it to get here but told all my friends it was on the way. I received it three days ago and all my friends have been by to ""look"" at it. I turn it on and they want to try it! It took me two days before I could get in and do the grout on my floors! They all wanted to try it on the oven and bathroom and... *laughing quietly* They cleaned the rest of my house for me! I told them they could come ""look"" anytime they wanted to.\nMy grout for my tile floors are white! Whose great idea THAT was I have no clue! Some of my friends will get on their knees and spend three days with a toothbrush and bleach trying to get their floors clean. Who has time for that?! Bleaching leaves the air toxic to my son, when I tried to clean the floors even at a 1/10 solution mix of bleach and water, he complains his nose and throat hurts! White tiles and grout in a high traffic area means everything turns brown and grungy looking! I spent months looking at reviews and even saw the infomercial for the Shark. Then went looking for this... long story short the only steamer I could find was a Euro-Pro Shark Steam Mop for $99.00!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Euro-Pro-Shark-Steam-Mop-Ready-To-Use-In-30-Seconds/dp/B001CS900K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Euro-Pro Shark Steam Mop Ready To Use In 30 Seconds</a>&nbsp;So I bought it and took it home turned it on and started cleaning floors... My tiles were cleaned with steam. Plain old water! My son wanted to help.. okay! Caution this handle is made of cheap thin plastic so be careful with it! It both feels and looks flimsy.\nBut the grout was still dark and so I got the Wagner 905 steamer. I am amazed! Steam the grout and run over everything with the Euro-Pro Shark Steam Mop afterward (son following me)and sparkling clean! Curtains on the rod? A snap! No taking them down and tossing in washer! Small spatters on the walls came right off, again I had tried a cloth and bleach did not help. The area under my dogs dish has to be the dirtiest in my house! Well not anymore! Pull this out lift the dishes and 15 mins latter my floors are clean! (Note it takes 15 mins for the tank to warm up!)\nThank you to the reviewer who said go buy some extra towels!\nThe steamer only comes with one pad for the floor attachment, so I took a ""white"" hand towel and folded it in half and put it on the floor brush $.75 for hand towel. I wanted to use white so ""I  could  see  it  cleaning!"" and I did!! There is extra water and you will want the towels to pick up the grime you are cleaning. I wanted this also for the  reasons of weaning off chemicals. I use baking soda for my towels and pads! They smell and look clean after being washed! Yes! Drop in washer and next morning they are good to go! I will not recommend putting the pads in the dryer as they do shrink a bit. You will not want to wash anything else with these towels and pads as they will be really yucky. I would like to think I keep my home clean. Well now I know my home is clean without all the chemicals and discomfort to my family! I would recommend this to anyone who is chemical sensitive, or just wishes to get away from the chemicals! Yay for going greener!";Be ready to be impressed!
75;105.0;5.0;6.0;"A friend and I decided to strip her walls of wallpaper so she purchased the Wagner wallpaper steamer. It worked great, but since only one of us could use it at a time, I purchased the Wagner 905 on-demand steamer to get the job done faster. This review is a side-by-side comparison of the two units.\n\nThe main difference is when you plug in the wallpaper steamer, it heats the water and steam rises naturally through the hose whereas the on-demand unit has an on/off switch, heats the water in a sealed container, building up pressure. The fill port is sealed by a serious, threaded bolt. Steam is released as desired by depressing a button at the end of the hose where various attachments can be clicked in. (It can be locked in an open position if desired). Note that a certain amount of water comes out with the steam with either unit and you'll need some towels handy whenever you're using it.\n\nI would have thought steam rising naturally in the wallpaper unit would be useless and the on-demand unit would simply be better in all situations, but that is not the case. There are some advantages to the wallpaper steamer unit and if all you want to do is remove wallpaper, it's the better choice.\n\nWallpaper steamer:\nThe wallpaper attachment is very lightweight and puts the steam more directly and closer to the wall than the wallpaper attachment of the on-demand unit which directs the steam through small openings underneath the attachment. The result is the wallpaper unit is a little faster at removing wallpaper than the on-demand unit. It's also less noisy and less fatiguing since its wallpaper attachment is lighter than the on-demand attachment and doesn't have the additional steam-release button section which adds weight (not much, but if you don't have a lot of upper body strength, and you have lots of rooms to strip, every ounce counts).  You can pull the attachment off and use the hose alone to target the narrow wall areas the flat attachment won't fit into (use gloves!). The water reservoir is somewhat translucent so you can judge when to refill and the port opening is big so refilling is easy.\n\nOn-demand unit:\nSteam is under pressure and a multitude of attachments are included enabling one to target the steam appropriately for the job at hand. The wallpaper unit only comes with a wallpaper attachment. The on-demand unit comes with a little plastic cup and funnel essential for filling the water reservoir. It holds 3 cups maximum (as per the instructions) but the steam lasts quite a long time - certainly enough for handling things like steaming floors or cleaning sinks, etc. It is difficult to tell how much water is remaining in the unit if you don't run the steam out, though. And if you do run the steam out, it'll take some time (10 minutes?) to heat new water sufficiently. My friend and I kept water heating on the stove to shorten the downtime whenever we needed to refill our units. I didn't pay attention closely to how long each unit lasted before refill, but they seemed similar even though the wallpaper unit holds 1 gallon and the on-demand holds only 3 little cups. I think it was because the on-demand unit only dispenses steam when desired. To get the wallpaper unit to stop, you must pull the plug and wait a little bit.\n\nI found the wallpaper attachment in the on-demand unit worked very well - but as I said above, the other unit was slightly better. The narrow, directed steam attachment worked better than just using the hose on the other unit since steam was coming out under pressure. Note that this pressure is quite noisy.\n\nThe floor attachment was OK, but I felt like I was just pushing wet dirt around and the cloth got dirty almost instantly. I found just using the directed steam attachment with a bunch of towels and sponges worked better - but it's too much effort to use for routine cleaning. Cleaning stainless steel sinks was fun and the faucet handles on my friend's faucets looked like they had been installed that day despite being over 25 years old. However, the water stains on my shower door did not come off, nor the water stains on the chrome part of the drain in my sink. So steam doesn't perform miracles. I used it to clean the barbecue and it was great. I didn't have to preheat the grill plates and with a little elbow grease, everything came out quite well.\n\nAll in all, I recommend both units and I don't understand why they aren't carried in hardware stores, Home Depot, Costco, etc.  No matter which unit you choose, you'll probably need to use some elbow grease to get things perfectly clean. The wallpaper unit is much simpler, lighter, easier to fill, you can judge the water level and it does a slightly better job removing wallpaper.  I don't know how useful all the attachments of the on-demand unit will prove or whether having steam under pressure is absolutely essential. The one big advantage of the on-demand unit is, well, you get steam ""on-demand"". That may tip the balance in favor of that unit depending on your needs.";Should be sold in every hardware store!
104;106.0;4.0;7.0;I am very happy with this steamer with two exceptions.  The cord should be longer, and the steam doesn't stay hot near for as long as it says.;FYI
76;107.0;5.0;6.0;I saw an infomercial for another steamer and then started researching them online.  I looked for over 2 weeks and kept coming back to this one.  I love this steamer.  It has great steam power.  I have gotten areas clean that I didn't think would ever look that good again.  I have a 10 year old washing machine that now looks like new!  The grout in my tile floor has never looked better, and bathrooms have never been shinier!  You won't be disappointed with this product!  Amazon couldn't have shipped it any faster, I had it in 2 days and that was with the standard shipping!  Highly recommend!!;BEST CLEANING TOOL EVER!!
78;108.0;5.0;6.0;I feel more than qualified to write this review because this is in fact my fifth steam cleaner!!! The older one gets, the more one has a genuine appreciation for steam cleaning. It saves time, money and it easy on the joints! There is no better way to GO GREEN!  In my humble opinion steam cleaning is superior to all other methods of cleaning...the results consistently validate this statement. Yes, seeing is believing!\n\nI have spent significantly more money on my other steam cleaners.  By far, the Wagner Spray Tech 282004 1,500-Watt On-Demand Power Steamer out performs my previous purchases!!!  Talk about more bang for the buck!\n\nMy daughter bought this machine because of my experience with it and is as pleased with its performance as I am!\n\nMrs. Clean recommends purchasing this machine.\n\nNote:  Get in the habit of switching off the unit when not in use.  Respect this machine and it will serve you well!;More bang for your buck!
51;109.0;4.0;5.0;I'm using this to remove paper wallpaper that is on drywall.  After first removing the outer layer of the paper, I tried to using only a liquid concentrated solution remover.  This required lots of repeated applications and lots of scraping, which only removed small sections.  Too much work for a large room, but works in tiny edge areas and around corners where a steamer cannot get.  Repeatedly soak the area (small is better because the paper dries).\n\nSo, I looked for a Steamer and found the Wagner 905 at Amazon that had pretty good reviews.  First, use a plastic putty knife that is not too wide (2-3in), something you can control.  The metal ones sometime gouge the wet wallboards.  Next, still soak the area that you plan to work on with either the concentrated remover, or just plain water (I just brush it on, about the size of 2 or 3 of the Wagner's base nozzle).  I do this because the steamer runs out of pressure, and needs to be recharged for a few seconds.  For me, the steamer did not work as well if you do not also wet the paper.\n\nIf you wet the area, and then steam a section for about 15sec, the paper/glue comes off like a knife in butter.  I find I can scrape one section and heat the next, all at the same time.  The only mess is the water that drips out of the steamer head.  Place plastic and lots of towels at the base because the water will run down the walls to the floor.  Also, USE a pan or plastic tub to place the head into while waiting for the pressure to rebuild.  Water drips all over the place.  I can do about 7-8X8ft area on 3cups of water before letting the unit cool down before a refil.  Couple of hours after moving and reset of the floor protection and wall wetting does the job.\n\nIs the Wagner the best, I think any steamer could do the task.  However the trigger on the nozzle, long hoses and cords and additional tools seem like a good deal.  I have not used any of the other attachments.  Also, distilled water or at least filtered water may keep the heating coils cleaner.  DO drain the unit after using and I keep the cap off for long term drying.;Great for WallPaper Removal
55;110.0;2.0;5.0;I am ready to send this product back.  While the machine does create steam it does little to clean.  There is not enough pressure of steam coming out to really benefit the use of this tool.  I used it to tackle wall paper and found the product to be more in my way than and plus to help reduce the work load.;Wagner Steamer Cleaner
56;111.0;5.0;5.0;After having steam cleaners in the past, and paying big $$$ for them, I decided to grab this unit from Wagner. I have been without a steam machine for a couple of years, and in the past have had the Euro Pro line as my main brand. But after a divorce, it was time to get my own. Right from the start, the Wagner 905 Power Steamer was put to the test, and I used it to clean my large gas grille. The wire brush tip worked well, and I had already cleaned the grates with oven cleaner several months before. They never did get clean with the oven cleaner, so I decided to give the Wagner 905 a shot. It melted the things the spray cleaner could not touch, and just took away all the nasty residue that had built up! BRAVO!\n\nThen the use of the cleaner for the floors, bathroom, shower, and kitchen showed the true power of the unit. After looking at the Shark cleaner, and several other brands, they do not do the job of the Wagner, and I would buy this over and over if given a chance. Highly recommended to purchase the Wagner 905 steam cleaner!;Makes cleaning a snap, a MUST HAVE!
90;112.0;5.0;6.0;Works well on wall paper, linoleum and even some floor tile.  Fun to use it to clean windows with the squeegee attachment.  It is not very loud, regardless of what others say.  Yes, the attachments are plastic and you must not use a lot of force on them or you will break them. The switch in the trigger really distinguishes this model from the cheaper one and it is well worth it.  Without the switch, you get too much water on the wall and the dry-wall blisters.  The wallpaper comes off easily but the drywall must be sanded and spackled before it can be painted.  How do I know that ?;Great steamer.  No regrets.
67;113.0;2.0;5.0;Out of the box I marveled at the construction of this product.  All the plastic pieces were made of heavy plastic and the product did not seem cheap at all.\n\nMy only problems:\n\n1- the instructions stated that a full tank of water would provide 45 min of steam.  i only received 20 min of steam.\n\n2- if you hold down the trigger for more than a minute the steam will eventually stop and you have to wait 1-2 minutes for the steam to start up again.\n\n3- one of the reviews for this product said that it cleaned grout between tiles very well.  i used the steamer on my kitchen counter grout and bathroom tile grout and i was not able to remove any stains (or restore the original color of the grout).\n\nI do not plan to return this item b/c I figure that I'll eventually need to use steam for something (i.e. clean my wife's jewelry, remove stains from cloth instead of using the washer,....);I'm not certain if it works that well?
106;114.0;4.0;6.0;I really like this product, with a few notations.  The attachments for cleaning the floor could be improved.  It scratched up my floor, but we are putting down a new one anyway so I wasn't totally upset.  Also, it would be great it there were an attachment to steam out wrinkles from clothes.  I tried it and couldn't find a good way that worked.  Besides that the product does produce enough steam to clean my bathroom and kitchen in one go, which is great for me.;Pretty darn good
74;115.0;2.0;5.0;Anyone who buys this has to understand that dirt does not just magically disappear with this item. And if your dirt is truly been there for awhile, you will have to at least pre-soak and when you do use the steam, you will have to carry a towel with you to mop up the dirty water.\n\nConsidering its reviews, I am most decidedly disappointed. This machine ins NOT, IS NOT for terrazzo or Mexican tile. You will not be happy if you plan to use this on anything but an easy wash tile and in that case you probably don't need it. It is good for dust and for dusty areas that are hard to reach. Ditto picture frames.\n\nYou will either have to get something better if you have true dirt. Also, the plastic parts break easily.;Not a miracle worker!
117;116.0;4.0;6.0;its horrible how noisy it is. you can barely hear anything else than this device while in use, but is efficient in hard places, it cleans a lot where nothing else can do it.;Too noisy
79;117.0;4.0;5.0;"I've used it to clean the hard to reach crevices in my washer and dryer, the bathroom grout, kitchen cabinents, stove, microwave, and my tile floors.  I'm very happy with it.  It is loud but this is a function of pressurized steam being released - not some flaw with the unit.  Just don't plan on steam cleaning while your spouse is watching tv.\n\nIt cleans the tile grout quite well - the brass brush works well for this.  We have 2 dogs so the floors do get dirty.  Using the two extensions means that you don't have to bend over or sit on the floor to clean the grout.  I do wish they'd included more than 1 brass brush (you get a couple plastic brushes).  Although you can do floors, the unit is not a steam mop and probably does not function as well as a unit designed solely for that purpose.  I would take this versatile unit over a dedicated steam mop any day.  You'll be amazed at all the uses you find for it (e.g. steaming your toothbrushes while you're cleaning the bathroom).\n\nThe cord could be a little longer and needs a hook or something on the unit that can be used to wrap or stowe the cord for storage.  The unit also needs a handle.  Since it has three wheels you'd naturally assume that the end with 1 wheel is the front.  However, thats the end where the power cord is attached.  The end with the steam pipe leading to your handle is attached to the back, thus you end up dragging it around backwards and it tends to want to turn itself around in the process.  You basically just drag it around sideways since the wheels are pretty much useless.  This isn't a big deal since it's not super heavy but it is an oddly obvious yet minor design flaw.\n\nPlan on carrying an old towel around with you to clean up the dirty water left behind; it's not a mess and the dirt doesn't magically disappear when you steam it, you need to wipe up that dirty water with something.  The floor attachment has clips so you can clip a towel or rag to the unit but doing so obstructs the flow of steam onto the floor.  I find that simply walking behind the unit on a old towel is a sufficient means of cleaning up and drying the floor.\n\nThe steam is quite hot.  You can remove paint from an old metal door using just a plastic brush and some gentle scrubbing.  If you have candles you've probably noticed how dust sticks to the candles.  I've used it to blast off that dust and found it's actually hot enough to melt the surface of the candles.  I haven't used it on wall paper but imagine it would work well.\n\nI'm not rating this 5 stars because it could be improved but I am very happy with the steamer.  It works as good or better than I expected.  I do not regret purchasing it and would not trade it for some other steam cleaner.  I would and have recommended this product to my friends and family.  If you purchase it I don't think you'll be disappointed.";great product
80;118.0;5.0;5.0;First I bought a smaller steam cleaner here on Amazon.  After only having it a few days we had a project come up that recqured a larger steam cleaner so I purchased this one based on the reviews.\n\nIt quickly cleaned the laminate and tile flooring.  It has a little more power then the smaller unit I own which affords for a little more cleaning power with a bit less scrubbing and quicker results for larger surfaces.  Also I like the ability for longer durations of cleaning with this unit.  I found that one filling produced enough steam to clean a single room or area (Where multiple fills were necessary with the smaller unit).\n\nItem arrived very quickly and in working condition.  Cleaning results were as expected.  As with the smaller unit it Easily cleans anything Chrome or stainless steel (except for Hard water Buildup).  Didn't have much luck on built on soap scum for porcelain surfaces.  Cleans Tile countertops (still need to do a bit of scrubbing for the grout) and any hard kitchen area.  Cleans Baseboards, Doors, Doorknobs, Shower Doors (except for Hard Water build up).\n\nI rated this 5 stars because the product cleaned as I had expected and was in good working condition.  At first I was a bit put off by the length of the hose, but soon found this to be very helpful when cleaning.  Would be nice if the hose detached for stoarge but knew this when buying it.  I found the noise to be that of an everage steam cleaner and it didn't really bother me.\n\nIf you are buying this to elimate cleaning solutions and go green, the only cleaners you can probably avoid by using this product is Windex, 409 and floor cleaners.  You will still need the assistance of Hard water removers, Bleach Based Bathroom cleaners and furniture polish (As I would not use this on wood surfaces with the exception of painted doors and baseboards).  This would be a great alternative to buying a steam mop.;What I Expected
85;119.0;5.0;5.0;This little machine is great!  I tried removing wallpaper the old fashioned way, with little success, until I purchased the Wagner Power Steamer.

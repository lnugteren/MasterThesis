I should have known it is a scam, because the return policy of the company (Shadowhawkflashlights) is 3 - 8 days.  The flashlights arrived and the light is no better than my 1990's bulb flashlights.  I phoned the company and they assured me I am not doing something wrong, so I tried to return the stuff, but they would not accept it, because it was more than 8 days.  I hope nobody else will fall for this obvious scam.  I will keep the flashlights for my grand children to play with because the light is so poor it will not harm their eyes.;A very obvious scam, do not fall for it.

My buddy fell for this scam.  I played with the light for a day, it's just garbage.;Yes, it's a scam.  Don't fall for any 5 star reviews
28;3.0;1.0;195.0;-409.62979999999993;"My wife ordered five of these flashlights.  Only one had a charger and battery (we later discovered that additional chargers/batteries come with upcharges - they even charge for the warranty).  Plus the storage boxes started falling apart after being opened _once_.  As others have mentioned, this is a rebranding of a $5 flashlight.  Five minutes' worth googling and Amazon reviews showed that these are a SCAM.\n\nHere are a few things you'll need to deal with Shadowhawk Industries:\n\n* Their Customer 'Service' number:  (866) 342-2144.\n\n* The knowledge that everyone on the distant end, CSRs and supervisors, are what I refer to as 'back office mouthpieces'.  First hint:  They try to talk over you instead of listening to you.  Their job is not to help you, but to maximize profitability for Shadowhawk Industries.  They will be polite and reasonably professional as they attempt to convince why you're wrong for calling...\n\n* Unlimited long distance minutes on your phone.  Expect to be on hold for 15 minutes; then another 15 minutes while they complain about how their system is down/slow.  Total time around 25 minutes.  Total duration of call expected to be about 35 minutes.  Try not to be too assertive; they're sensitive and will threaten to hang up on you.\n\n* The URL (web address) of the 'receipt' they sent you.  This is the ONLY place you'll find your order number; it's NOT shown on the web page screen itself.  It's in the URL (the web address in the Location bar at the top of the screen).  You should see something like this:  [....]where the 'nnnnnnnn' is your order number.\n\n* Shadowhawk Industries' corporate address:  Shadowhawk Flashlights, 7582 Las Vegas Blvd. S #115-405, Las Vegas, NV 89123.  This is to establish jurisdiction, which is in the State of Nevada.  Here's the Nevada Attorney General's Consumer Protection Hotline:  (702) 486-3132.\n\n* Shadowhawk Industries' return merchandise address in California:  Shadowhawk Flashlights, 7875 Highlands Village Place, Suite B102 #401, San Diego CA  92129.  This will also establish jurisdiction in the State of California.  Here's the California State AG Consumer Protection website: [...]\n* USPS signature delivery confirmation when you send the merchandise back.  Otherwise, you have no proof that you sent it or that they received it.  And you WILL need proof.  Sorry, they won't pay return postage.\n\n* Another call to Shadowhawk once delivery has been made.  Otherwise, you probably won't see your refund in your lifetime (I'm in this phase as of this writing).\n\nWhat you will NOT receive:  A standard Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number.  They'll try to pass a 'voice return authorization' off on you.  Don't fall for it; keep pressing.  Eventually, they'll tell you to use the order_id number in the URL.\n\nIf you've purchased this product and are unhappy with its quality, these are the tools you'll need.  NOT RECOMMENDED.";BAD flashlights...if not purchased through Amazon, here's what you'll need to return them...

2;7.0;5.0;8.0;-30.541596638655435;Very good and bright flash light in a strong metal housing.  Comes with one rechargeable Li-ion battery and charger plus one insertable adapter for 3 AAA battery use.  Using the supplied Li-ion battery gives a little brighter beam that lasts longer than using 3 AAA batteries.  The included battery case is very sturdy and durable making it a good companion when bringing the flashlight along in the car or any tool chest either in the garage, cabin or work place.  Another plus with this flashlight is the ease of refocusing the light beam by sliding the front part of the unit.  It is also a flashlight to have at someone's nightstand in case of power outage at night.;Very bright flashlight for any situation.

One completely stopped working and the other flickers on a full charge. The photos showing how bright this is are obviously fake. It is clear to me this is not a military flashlight, its a piece of junk. This also is not 800 Lumens otherwise it would be much brighter. It might reach 200 Lumens at max. I have another flashlight that is 350 Lumens and it out shines this one by a long shot. I would recommend every go with the Bushnell tactical line of flashlights.

It does indeed light up an incredible amount from a far distance. It came without ANY instructions. You may ask why a flashlight may need instructions? It came with a rechargeable battery and a charger. When you plug the charger in it displays a green light, when you insert the battery it displays a red light. Contrary to mist chargers I have a red light means the battery is not fully charged, a green light indicates a full charge. This appears to work in the exact opposite manner. The flashlight also does not give any icon for which way the battery should be inserted into the sleeve of the flashlight. The additional battery insert that allows the use of 3 AAA batteries does not show which way to insert batteries into it, nor does it indicate which way the battery holder should be inserted into the sleeve of the flashlight. Instructions would help a user know how to address these issues and questions.;Great But Needs Instruction Manual

I was offered the items with a bag and my own brand name for $2.78 including shipping or they will allow drop shipping as well.  The ""official site"" they use where thry claim the price is 75% off contains pictures that sre not even theirs, the one that illuminates the whole building or mountain is the photo of the flashlight built by an individual and that has 90,000 lumens for which he has a patent for.

I never intended on mass selling these either but I wanyed to find out what the wholesale price was, so I found a contact through alibaba which is where I got the price.  With enough complaints, the FBI should eventually get on their case for scam.  Of you want to try something like this, I would suggest not to pay anything more than 5 or maybe 10 bucks, and if you really want a good flashlight, you may want to stick to known brands.

I called the company and since it was out of warranty the best they could was to sell me a new one for $37. While I was on hold with the company I McGuivered it and placed two silver nickels in the case between the end cap and the battery. It works GREAT!

The box has four plastic clips to lock it down, one doesn't close properly so immediately I knew the company doesn't practice good quality control.  The flashlight inside feels heavy and sturdy, and features all the modes it advertised : several zoom modes, strobe and SOS.  It didn't include an instruction manual and I couldn't find one on the web, so it took me a while to figure out I had to keep the on button pressed for a while to change modes.  In the ad literature as well as in the videos, this flashlight is said to be capable of blinding and disorienting potential aggressors when the light is shined directly in their eyes, particularly in strobe mode.  I tried this on myself first and then on a few of my friends and even though it is somewhat powerful it should, in no way, be considered a tool for self defense.  Other than this it is a decent flashlight but one that can easily be substituted with much less expensive alternative options.;Shadowhawk x800
23;44.0;1.0;5.0;2.3153012048193062;Junk and poor customer service....bought 5 of these...chargers and batteries do not function.  Contacted ShadowHawk .....concerning replacement of the chargers and batteries and received idiot instructions on how to use the charger.  What a joke....do yourself a  favor, do your homework and buy a product with positive feedback.  I love the footage of the plane rolling over the indestructible ShadowHawk flashlight,but dang it doesn't work as advertised. SAVE YOUR MONEY.....Good flashlights out there. Be a smart BUYER;Poor Product and Customer Service.....Save your money on this product.
43;45.0;3.0;5.0;-83.15970588235291;"Just got my flashlight!!! Definitely the brightest one I've ever owned. Works great with AAA's but I'm stoked for having the rechargeable battery in case of a real emergency. They're supposed to last 6 hours, so I'm glad I have the option available. At first, it was a little more pricey than I hoped, thank goodness for Amazon. Love my flashlight!!!\n\nI used to work for the company responsible for this product. Never purchased the product, but was ""encouraged"" to write a positive review. I no longer work there and do not feel the need to leave the false positive review.\n\nIt's a good product, but there are definitely cheaper ones with far more lumens availible. (Lumen: is the SI derived unit of luminous flux, a measure of the total quantity of visible light emitted by a source.)<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ShadowHawk-X800-High-Tactical-Flashlight-800-Lumens-x2000-With-Case/dp/B01EM3IL06/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ShadowHawk X800 High Tactical Flashlight 800 Lumens x2000 With Case</a>";Good Flashlight, Bad Company

7;1.0;4.0;5.0;-104.06746411483252;I have owned this classic buck knife in the past... and to be honest, this knife was not the quality I have come to expect from them.\nWhen gazing down the edge of the top of the tip of the knife you can notice a distinct deviation in its milling... so that instead of a straight spine to the tip of the knife you can notice a slight S curve.\nThe 75th anniversary emblem was seated crooked in the handle... so it looks trashy rather than something to be proud of.\nI live in the alaskan interior. So ill keep the knife... as i need it on my hip pretty much all the time... the steel is decent though and holds its edge without needing to be reaharpened for a long time... which is one reason i like buck knives. The aluminum on the pommel was pretty scratched up too... which kind of put me off... not that ot matters.\nMy grandfather gave me my first buck knife when a was probably 6 years old or so... and because of that sentimental attachment i have to the brand... ill give it 4 stars... but my disappointment in the quality is really saying 3 stars... get your act together buck.;Not the quality I have grown up to know
44;2.0;5.0;185.0;-274.80797297297295;"I recently purchased this knife to use on a camping trip. it is a classic design and it is executed flawlessly. the blade comes razor sharp out of the box and should be easy to sharpen because it is 420hc stainless (i haven't had to sharpen it yet though). I've also seen other reviews that did thorough testing of the blade for corrosion resistance, and they rate it as excellent (i haven't had it long enough to tell personally). the handle is a work of art; the guard and pommel are polished brass, and the handle is cocobolo wood which gives it a warm and classic look. Buck's attention to detail and workmanship is remarkable, as the brass meets the wood seamlessly so it is very comfortable to hold. it's a full-tang knife, meaning that the blade goes all the way through the handle and into the pommel, where it is attached with a brass rod (this too is seamlessly polished). it comes with a dark brown leather sheath that is also very well made and looks like it will last a lifetime. the sheath has a belt loop and can be worn comfortably on the hip.\n\nwhen i was deciding which knife to get, i considered this one, as well as the standard buck 119 (with phenolic handle and aluminum guard and pommel) and the limited edition 119 (with stacked leather handle and aluminum guard/pommel). After handling all three knives in a store, i liked the feel of the wood/brass handle the most. this is the heaviest of the three knives (at 10.5oz, compared to 7.5oz for the phenolic handle and 7.3oz for the stacked leather), and the balance point is about an inch below the guard which makes it sit nicely in the hand (on the other two, the balance point was right at the guard). i personally like the heft of the knife, but i could see it getting tiring after extended use.\n\noverall, i am very happy with the purchase and i highly recommend it to any hunter/camper/knife enthusiast. i'll try to upload some pictures too, to show all these details.";beautiful, well made knife
29;3.0;4.0;103.0;-109.51298165137612;What can you say about Buck knives that hasn't already been said. Made in USA (I wish the sheathes were). Great craftsmanship at great prices for what you get. The definition of their craft.\n\nTwo issues I have with this knife. First, the sheath has two rivets holding the belt loop on. The top one rubs the beautiful cocobolo handle and leaves a small wear mark on it. I removed that rivet and put in it's place a small leather lace that does what the rivet did. No more wear problem.\n\nSecond, the knife comes sharp as can be, but it is a rough ground edge. I like a mirror edge on my cutting tools, so I will sit down one of these days with some stones, diamond-sharpeners and some emery and get that edge polished nicely.\n\nI will add my own images so you can see what I am talking about. The one with the knife edge shows the rough grind, but I had already begun the polishing process. I should have snapped a photo right out of the box like I did the sheath.\n\nFour stars because of the sheath issue and the edge issue. Other than that, this is a great American-made kife that will certainly out live me.;A Buck knife is like a Martin guitar. Both are true American legends.

I purchased my first Buck knife 40 years ago (aside from cosmetic blemishes it is as good as ever), and am pleased to say that this one is just as good as that knife. Still made by hand in El Cajon, California; still with a thick and sturdy leather sheath (imported now but saddle-grade none the less), this is an exquisite piece of cutlery. Besides being an inveterate outdoorsman, I am also a chef and am very choosy about my blades. I never bought a Buck 119 in my youth because in my view it was ""too big""...and I also didn't have the disposible income to spend on it. Simply, it is handsome, well-balanced, and a true classic that feels good in your hand...it's the '57 Chevy of hunting knives, and considering inflation, a lot less expensive than it used to be.

34;6.0;5.0;67.0;-36.09666666666662;There is a lot of misinformation out there about whether the Buck 119 Special has a full tang or not.  Some reviewers even misstate that it has a partial tang.  Oops!!  Well there are a lot of great reviews of this knife and I wanted to make sure that anyone interested in it, should buy it without reservation.  It DOES have a full tang that extends all the way to the pommel where it is pinned.  The pin is ground and polished flush to the pommel to the point where it is almost not noticeable aside for a small seam if your lucky enough to even see it. I hope this helps anyone that is still unsure after searching high and low for confirmation.  It is a great knife and tremendous value for the money.;Excellent Knife Made in the USA
5;7.0;5.0;75.0;-47.43647058823527;Every man should have one of these! I purchased my first Buck 119 Special earlier this year. It has never failed me since. What I loved about the knife was it's weight and balance. It is handle heavy, but it still feels like it's in your control. The blade comes razor sharp and can cut just about anything!!!! Trust me I've tried. I did not buy it from Amazon however. I bought it at Wal-Mart for $34.99 (with a nylon sheath). Almost every Wal-Mart carries this knife. And believe me they arn't cheaply made. If you wish to buy a more reasonable 119, Wal-Mart is place to go. As far as performance goes, the 119 can do anything from skinning your buck to doing camping chores. It's perfect for every woodsman, hunter, fisher, and adventurer!! Please buy this classic all American beauty, you won't regret it!!!!!!;Exellent looks, perfomance, & price = A Buck 119 Special

18;9.0;5.0;26.0;-39.28239726027395;I really hate to do this, but it must be done. The blade started to rust after two nights in the rainy mountains. The brass was also heavily tarnished. It looked like it was 10 years old after 2 nights. I sent in a picture and my concerns to customer service 3 days ago, still no reply. Called up Buck, they said send it in and they will replace it. It was a 5 star knife out of the box, really stunning actually, but let me down and no reply to the pictures I sent to customer service = 2 stars.

14;10.0;5.0;20.0;-93.42654639175254;"This review is regarding the 119BR (brass/wood handle). The first one I received had a terrible bloodgroove; looked rough milled and unfinished. Buck said it was a ""Blem"" and replaced it plus gave me a 25% off coupon. You can still call Buck and someone answers the phone; their customer service is excellent. They will refurbish and/or sharpen knives for a small charge and relatively quickly, and they have the lifetime warranty. The replacement I received had a much better bloodgroove, although not as smooth as those on my 119 and 619 from the 1980's. Somewhere along the way they must have changed how they machined the grooves. The replacement also had some swirls/marks in the brass on the bottom of the handle - I easily polished them out. The edge is excellent right out of the box, and now this knife looks so nice I don't want to use it. I like the weight, although perhaps it is slightly grip-heavy. I've used Buck knives for at least 30 years; the quality is still great. I bought a phenolic handle handle Special recently and it's excellent as well.";Buy Buck!

It has never failed me, has withstood more abuse than I can recollect and, through it all, has scarcely a blemish and an edge that is still sharp enough with which to shave.  I have many other knives, K-Bars from my USMC days, Gerbers, Pumas, Case, other Bucks...and all are awesome, but this one is very near and dear to me for all it has been through and all it continues to deliver.\n\nDo yourself a service and pick one of these up.

9;12.0;5.0;5.0;-93.77914572864319;Unlike many people on here, for me, this knife will probably never skin a deer or any other animal.  I probably won't be wandering off into the wilderness Bear Grylls style.  In fact, the most action it will likely get is opening Amazon boxes!\n\nAll that said, this is a really beautiful knife.  Incredibly solid.  Great weight.\n\nI've owned a smaller Buck knife before, but it always bothered me that the handle was a shade too small for my hand.  This seems like more of a 'full sized' knife to me.  Very sharp.  Incredibly well made.  Seems like an excellent quality for the price.\n\nI enjoy the warm look of the wood and brass, even though I would normally choose a more modern look, the old school vintage look of this knife really did appeal.\n\nI thought it was cool that this was a commemorative knife for their 75 year celebration.

10;13.0;1.0;9.0;-147.56555118110236;Terrible sheath.\nWow...I hate to have to write this about an American icon but here it goes. The sheath which is made in Mexico has a thin poorly designed strap held in place by two rivetes which easily tore lose after the third day of wearing it on my belt. I intended to use this as my edc (every day carry) but i knew as soon as I took the knife out of the package that the belt loop was going to be a problem. It is extremely flimsy. I'm surprised that it lasted three days. When wearing a knife on your belt vertically at the hip all day it is going to deal with flex or movement when you sit down as the sheath comes in contact with the seat when you sit down. Especially when sitting in cars with bucket seats. Anyone who wears a mid to large size knife edc in this way will know what I'm talking about.\nI really like the knife. The fit and finish of this knife is excellent for $60. It came sharp. I am shocked at how poorly this American classics all leather sheath performed. I am sending the sheath back to Buck knives for repair however I don't think it will help so I am now going to buy a $40 hand made saddle leather cross draw sheath on Amazon which brings the total for this knife to a little over $100 which isn't a great deal after all.;Terrible sheath made in Mexico

The sheath was so well form fitted for this knife that I wasn't sure if it was real leather or not until I sniffed it, yup, it's leather and when the knife is in the sheath and the sheath is snapped closed the upper part of the sheath raps around most of the handle for protection from scratching.

19;32.0;3.0;6.0;-268.21204545454543;"I got my first 119 about 20 years ago, and while it is a well made knife of good materials,  the 119 is kind of an odd duck.  It was born in the mid 50s, at kind of a high point of American old-west fascination coupled with then modern materials (phenolic and aluminum.)\n A ""Classic Western Knife""  In reality it was more of a exercise in making a default 'big American Knife'  that ticked all the check boxes for such, while looking vaguely like a bowie.  Honestly back in 1955-60 there really wasn't a big knife market, and very few production examples.  Almost everything outside of a solingen hunting sabre was smaller, aside from the few KA-BARs that went around in vague availability.\n\nAnyway what you've ended up with, is a slick-and-awkwardly handled, brutally thick bladed, diamond-cross section hollow-grind,  with an aggravating, almost superfluous guard, and an overly dramatic clip point that has poor utility or piercing power.\n\nIt really doesn't excel at anything.  It can kind of chop, but the hollow grind is so steep and thick, it is as likely to turn off the wood, particularly at shallow angles.  The slick grip requires extra force to grip, which tires out the hand,  plus the guard gets in the way of any detail work. Sawing off the back of the guard is a very common field modification.  The balance is neutral, and striking anything is percussive and buzzy.\n\nIt isn't a fighter. It will cut, but the short handle doesn't assist in any grip agility, and it seems like you have to take extra effort to actually get the blade to go anywhere.\n\nIt is sharp, and it can skin, but the grip and size become again hindrances in agility.  Sharpening these are a serious exercise in frustration for knife neophytes.\n\nGood to collect, and anyone who is a knife aficionado should probably own one at least once, but as far as users, there are better edges out there in this modern day, particularly with availability, including from Buck themselves.";A classic, well crafted knife, but actually kind of mediocre in use.

The 119 saved me from a pack of wild dogs in 1968 when I was setting up a tree stand for bowhunting a day before the season started.  My knife was to cut limbs so my arrow would have a clear path in all directions.  I won't get into the gory details but this knife saved my life as I was returning to camp. This model is one of the best all around hunting knives that will handle just about anything you need done as far as camp chores, game or food preparation, and anything else it was designed for.  For lighter chores, small game, pan fish and trout, or around the camp kitchen I use the Woodsman 102 that is still a favorite when a larger knife isn't needed.  The medium size and larger three bladed stock knife is a winner for all small game and camp chores, general use as well as EDC. The single blade knives like everyone carried for years in a pouch on their belt is a good all around knife too for most jobs but not a really good blade for certain tasks. To say I am a fan of Buck Knives is an understatement.  I have depended on them for many years and I haven't been let down once.  Whether I am elk hunting  in Colorado, deer hunting where ever, pig hunting in the south, cleaning fish along the Florida coast, or backpacking the AP, a Buck knife will be with me on every adventure! You won't go wrong with a Buck knife!;Buck knives....among the best!
17;35.0;5.0;5.0;31.50164179104479;This is the original Buck hunting knife that's been around forever, however with Cocobolo handle and gold accents. It works just as well as a regular Buck knife but looks much nicer. The only downside is that you might be reluctant to dirty it up by using it in the woods. Just remember, it's still a hunting knife and wants to work for its keep.;Classic Hunting Knife, Only Better
24;36.0;1.0;7.0;-72.7213736263736;After owning this knife for about a year the hanle broke off this cheeseball piece of Buck trash! I paid alot for this unit just to have it break on me ,and if you repair there knife so you can use it that voids the Buck warranty, it costs Buck almost nothing to produce this cheeseball pile of drivle, up yours Buck,I would not take this with me into the woods or steelhead fishing, you want a knife you can depend on and buck is not it!! That is the first and last buck I will ever own or purchase, I have a cheap survival knife from China that I paid $8 for and it has really held up with no problems whatsoever and it holds an edge very well for what I paid for the CHEESEBALL buck trash knife I could buy six survival knives that would last several lifetimes, BUCK SUCKS, lets repeat that BUCK SUCKS, this is the worst company I have ever dealt with bad warranty extremely bad products, and you still suck the big one Buck!!!!;incredable JUNK!!!!!
37;37.0;5.0;8.0;-39.682075471698084;My grandfather bought this knife in the early 80s and has used it during most every hunting season he's hunted.  I have always liked the look of the knife and the feel when you're using it, so I asked him his opinion about it.  He says that the knife is great for skinning and holds an edge once one is put on it.  The blade is so hard that an edge can be difficult to put on it, but once it's sharp it will remain sharp for a while.  He told me that once he was having a fellow hunter was having trouble cutting through the sternum of a deer and he gave the guy the knife and a hammer and told him to beat the knife through the bone!!  It worked like a charm and the knife held up AND the guy went and bought a BUCK of his own!\n\nThey're simply great!;Never been a regret in 30 years

It's 420HC Stainless Steel Blade makes it worth the high price, the blade will outlive me.\nI don't exactley collect knives, but appreciate good steel because I depend on them when needed. This knife will defintely be used a lot. The only down nit picky thing for me is it's not well balanced, the handle is much heavier than I would typically like for the blade end size and weight.";Knife
22;39.0;5.0;6.0;-100.00236842105261;This knife is amazing! The build quality is everything I expected and so much more. My only complaint is the poorly placed rivet on the leather belt loop that some have identified as a possible irritant to the smooth wooden handle.\n\nThere have been some user posted modifications to the belt loop construction that look simple enough to perform. I haven't seen any scrapes on the handle yet, but I will definitely be looking into the mod, just because I want to preserve the beauty of this knife.\n\nI was very surprised with the sharpness of the edge even right out the the box. I used this knife in my first processing of a backyard chicken that decided he wanted to crow instead of egg-laying and I was very impressed with the ease I had in performing the delicate cuts during skin removal and cleaning. Since I consider myself a beginner in preparing animals for food, I definitely noticed a huge improvement in capability when using a higher quality, sharp knife vs. a low quality blade that couldn't hold an edge to save it's life.;Lives up to the Buck Knife legend!
35;40.0;5.0;7.0;48.238529411764716;This is one great looking knife, it feels very sturdy, and it was easy to get a sharp edge on it. The leather sheath seems to be very durable as well, with a belt loop and a snapping loop that holds the knife in place. It was a gift for a friend, and he loves it.\n\nAlso, like many Buck knives, it was made in the USA.;She's a beauty

Old reliable is sometimes still the best.\n\nGuys with Sig autos still carry back-up revolvers.  That little 5 shot .38 won't jam.  I've got tactical lights, but keep a battery operated Maglite in the toolbox.  How do you recharge a Streamlight in the event of a power outage?  I have a Benchmade automatic one handed knife clipped in my right front pocket.  However, the Buck 110 sits right alongside my side arm on my gun belt.\n\nClumsy, big, heavy, two handed folder.  But yet, rugged, reliable, and razor sharp.  I hang up the gun belt, and stash the Baretta 92 & Benchmade in the gun locker; then walk out in my civilian clothes with my Chief's Special and my Buck 110 tucked in my waistband.\n\nBesides, unless you're going into close quarters combat, who really needs to have a one handed knife for opening beef jerkey?  The kind of guy who still wears a Members Only jacket & Rayban Aviators.  That's who!  And you know who you are.  Now shave that moustache Magnum.\n\nThe Buck 110 I had as a kid.  Got it in the 8th grade.  Back in those days, a kid could go to school with a folding pocket knife.  It wasn't that big of a deal.  Teachers didn't freak out.  I was always cutting sandwiches for sharing, and slicing apples for the teacher.  At that age, I got a real kick out of when the pretty teachers would ask to borrow my knife to open envelopes and packages.  The Buck 110 on my hip & a Swiss Army in my back pack followed me all the way through College.\n\nAh, the 8th grade.  13.  Such a magical age.  When you first hit puberty and it seemed like the world was just starting to make sense.  The year before high school.  Your adolescence was just beginning.  A time for ""first"".  Your first slow dance.  Your first kiss.  And for me, my first hand gun.\n\nI was finally old enough to carry a sidearm on our family camping and hunting trips.  This was back in the days when at 8, I was taught to shoot small game with a .22, so by 13, I already knew what I was doing.  It was a .38 Smith & Wesson w/ a 4 inch barrel.  Stainless steel to hold up to the elements of being outdoors.  I thought I was Dirty Harry.  It came with a couple of speed loaders, a quick-draw clamshell holster, and a Buck 119, on a Sam Brown belt.\n\nBack then, we didn't have crack cocaine, gangsta rap, or Oprah.  All that I cared about was combing my hair into a duck tale like Fonzie, and ""making it"" with the ladies like Jack Tripper & Larry Dallas @ The Regal Beagle.  The was no UFC.  KickBoxing was ""The Sport of the Future"".  And ""Iron"" Mike Tyson was still snatching purses from old ladies.  America was a great country, in simpler times, and it was an innocent age.  We had a cowboy movie actor, who loved jellybeans, for a president.  And Iraq was our ally in the Iran-Iraq war.\n\nTo this day, I still keep a Buck 119 in my camp gear.";Classic

28;43.0;5.0;5.0;-88.67763819095474;This is a fantastic knife and sheath . It is so sharp that it shaves my arm . I can't believe that a knife sheath can be of such good quality leather. I have this knife by me on the couch and i use it to open boxes of the many products i buy . I have this hangup that i just can't seem to shake . The knife is so beautiful and perfect that i can't bring myself to use it . I have a nice Buck pocket knife i bought many years ago and i just can't bring myself to use it. It's like i need to buy two : one to use and one to stay brand new . This is not a joke . That's how much i like Buck knifes. Also , Amazon.com sends me these offers on knives that i just can't pass up . I now have a small collection of Bowies that i have bought through Amazon.com . In fact , i like these knives so much that i gave a Timber Rattler to my girlfriend's son-in-law , because i know that he likes knives as much as i do . Ed Garcia Youngsville.

31;44.0;5.0;5.0;-65.24441176470586;I bought this knife because it's a real classic and looks great.  I find I don't use it much because it's too big for most jobs.  I should have bought the woodsman or pathfinder instead.  The steel holds an edge well but takes forever to sharpen.  For it's size and thickness the blade seems sharper than other knives this size.  The blood groove is stupid but looks cool.  The grip is a bit slippery but poses no problem unless your hands are bloody.  The knife resists rust better than most.  The knife is light weight for it's size yet durable. Sheath is great.  I think for most chores like carving wood, dressing game smaller than an Elk, cutting open boxes, rope etc a 3.5 to 4 inch knife with non-serrated blade is about perfect.  This knife does perform ok for filleting Salmon however.  Not the best because it's not flexible but works fine in a pinch.  I have cleaned many fish with it.;Nice classic but too big for most jobs
38;45.0;5.0;5.0;48.38887096774195;I haven't had a chance to take this out in the woods yet, but I was immediately impressed by the quality of the knife. Plus it looks like a million bucks, even in the sheath. Everyone who sees it laying around my house is drawn to it. This is my first quality knife and I'm very happy with my choice.;Very Well Made And Looks Great

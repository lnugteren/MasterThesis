1;1.0;1.0;6.0;-36.930588235294096;I didn't have any of the problems that other reviewers had with regards to assembly.  The holes were all lined up fine and none of the nuts stripped out.  I even had a door frame that the bar fit well on too.\n\nMy main complaint is that this thing flexes and bends when I hang from it.  It claims it will support up to 300 lbs.  I weight 225 and if I use the outer handles, the entire front of the bar bends down a couple of inches or more.  I don't trust this thing to support my weight over the long haul of the P90X workout.  I friend of mine blew out his knee in college when the chin up bar he was using broke free.  I think the design is sound, they just need to have it manufactured somewhere where they aren't using cheap grade tubular steel.;Flimsy
2;2.0;4.0;9.0;-122.69923766816139;DIMENSIONS: The long tubular bar that braces against the inside-facing part of your door frame is 41 inches long (so your frame has to be a couple of inches narrower than that--and most are). The upper rectangular bar that braces against the top lip of the outside-facing part of your door frame is 18 inches long (so your frame has to be a couple of inches wider than that--and most are).\n\nThe bar is working wonderfully for me, and I'm definitely glad I went with the type that has the extra grips. I'm not using the extra braces that are meant to be screwed into the wall above the outside-facing part of the door frame. I think these are included mostly to prevent a catastrophic, lawsuit-inducing door frame collapse that isn't likely to happen if you have a normal, sturdy frame.\n\nOne star is removed only because what others have said about the bolts being made of lower-quality metal appears to be true. I read the reviews and was prepared, so I assembled mine VERY CAREFULLY, only letting the screwdriver slip a few times. Even then I could see that a few more slips and the ends would be stripped. Just do it carefully and you'll be fine.\n\nI would definitely recommend this to a friend.;Working out wonderfully for me
7;3.0;4.0;17.0;12.206263736263764;Got it for christmas 2010. The instructions state that it is a new 2011 model with nuts and bolts that cannot be tightened by hand. This creates a lock that makes them harder to loosen while the bar is being used. After gathering my tools, I found that these nuts and bolts were hard to turn and they started stripping!!!\nI hope I don't ever have to take it apart... cause it probably wouldnt happen without needing to drill/tap the dang things out... but everything else seems good quality...;Nice pullup bar.
4;4.0;1.0;7.0;25.8964285714286;I got this pull up bar to use with the p90x training system to replace the one I already have, it had two major problems, one its far to long to fit most doors, and secondly it wobbled all over the place  and started to bend under my weight. im only 160 lbs. better luck next time, I will not be buying Black MT again. also the directions for assembleing the thing are useless, you need to use the picture on the amazon site.;Worthless
3;5.0;1.0;5.0;-70.5438372093023;"The provided screws do not go all of the way into the provided wall anchors. The screws are too short! I am an engineer and it is clear to me that this design has not been fully considered. The purpose of a wall anchor is to have the screw enter the locking area of the anchor. I must now go to the hardware store and attempt to purchase the correct hardware to mount this piece of crap.\n\nAlso the direction are simply one picture and it is ambiguous as to the orientation of certain components. You can muddle through this but it is certainly very annoying.\n\nLastly, the instructions call for a 1/4"" drill bit for the wall anchor. This size drill bit is clearly too large for the wall anchors as they slide out very easily (even after the provided screws which are too short are inserted). I now have four ugly holes in my dry wall.\n\nI strongly recommend going with a different pull up bar.";Poorly designed.
5;6.0;1.0;5.0;-35.58837209302321;I received this item and began the assembly.  It's fairly straight forward, no rocket science needed.  When I attempted to screw the nuts onto the machine screws that are provided, things started to go south.  These fasteners must have been manufactured somewhere in Borneo. They are of the poorest quality material and workmanship I have ever encountered.  A wrench that would fit on one nut wouldn't fit others.  Some may be metric while others are standard.  If I didn't have a large assortment of different tools the item would not be assembled.  I almost forgot, I bought all new fasteners that meet US manufacturing standards to replace the junk that came with the product.  My advice ...... Don't walk, RUN away from any Black Mountain product.;Don't Walk, RUN
6;7.0;2.0;6.0;4.333707865168563;My original feedback was not displayed.  I rated this item a single star.  The nuts and bolts included with this item were inferior and stripped out nearly instantly.  I stopped after stripping 2 of 2 attempts.  To remedy I had to purchase all new nuts and bolts from our local hardware store at the cost of about $9.00.\nThe item did arrive quickly which was nice.  Unfortunately, it took another week before I could fully assemble it.\n\nNot sure why Amazon didn't display my first review.;Not happy
0;8.0;5.0;7.0;4.642772277227763;My wife purchased this for me to use with P90X.  She wanted to minimize the amount of space used to store workout equipment.  It is nice and small and fits behind the door.  I am only about 190 pounds so it holds me quite well and I never feel like I am going to fall.  The instructions were easy to follow and I had no issues during assembly.  Once all the bolts are tightened, it becomes quite sturdy.  The grips are comfortable and feel nice on my hands.  Overall I am quite pleased with the quality and use of the product.;Good deal for the price
8;9.0;5.0;6.0;35.35606557377051;Sturdy bars that work well and arrived quickly.  Customer support is awesome.  A couple of screws did not have a slot in the head and they would have sent me some but I grinded a slot in with a dremel tool and no problem.  I will definitely buy from BMP again to support a family based small business with great prices!;Great bars

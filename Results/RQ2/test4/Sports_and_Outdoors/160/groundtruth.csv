103;1.0;4.0;1878.0;-590.3916371681415;"July 14, 2016: original review: 5 stars\n\nGot mine today and it is fabulous! It is very well-made and has plenty of power/torque. I am almost 63, have knee arthritis and can no longer run but I have no problem riding this thing. It is highly maneuverable and after just a short while, moving & turning almost becomes second-nature. It goes where you will it to go, as if the MiniPro is an extension of your body. Just amazing! It will definitely increase my range of motion. Looking forward to take it to our neighborhood park for a spin and enjoy the breeze on my face again.\n\nJuly 15, 2016 -- Revising my review to 3 stars after riding over 6 miles today:\n\nReducing my rating from 5 stars to 3 stars. My single complaint: the artificial speed limit of 10 mph. I suppose Ninebot/Segway doesn't want lawsuits, so they artificially set the speed limit to 10 mph, which I can understand; however, the problem arises when the unit senses a speed faster than 10 mph, then it SUDDENLY SLAMS THE BRAKE ON YOU, abruptly slowing you down to 4 mph or so. This sudden decrease of speed just as you are accelerating to your desired cruising speed can actually throw you off balance, requiring you to immediately adjust your stance or risk falling over. I believe this ""safety"" feature is counter-productive. It ADDS to the risks of falls rather than reduces them. Believe me, 10 mph is easily reached on flat, even ground. After which you are constantly pestered by this very annoying on-again, off-again acceleration and deceleration, even on wide-open flat terrain, making you look like a teenybopper getting behind the wheel of a car for the first time. My suggestion is a speed limit of 15 mph and if the rider does reach this speed, the unit will just allow him to go no faster rather than to try to reduce the speed on its own. I am nearly 63 and I am no whippersnapper or speed demon but I am a skier. As skier, I am used to cruising fairly fast on open terrain in absolute confidence. As stable as the MiniPro is, there is no reason why this should not be done. This 'speed punishment"" thing is very frustrating. Yes, I know, this is not skiing, but is 15 mph too much to ask?\n\nI rode for more than 6 miles today and the machine only used 2 out of 5 bars of juice. Cool!\n\nUPDATE: July 16, 2016, Revised to 2 stars (so my review will be read by people, perhaps the company too. Still like the machine, by the way)\n\nRode for 2 more miles this morning, with my morning coffee in one hand. Here are my final thoughts: This machine has the potential to be great; however, it is SERIOUSLY HOBBLED by suit-fearing company lawyers with its latest firmware. As of now, it is like driving your car with your drivers-ed teacher at your side, constantly stepping on your brakes to slow you down. Even if you keep it below 10 mph, the machines seems to be working against you by tending to lean backward to slow you down. As result, the control level becomes posteriorly positioned in relationship to your legs. With you trying to lean forward to keep moving, the control lever becomes so posteriorly placed, its forward portion is barely touching the back parts of your lower thighs. This makes it more difficult to control your direction.\n\nI may try to improvise a control lever extension to remedy this problem. I have made a slightly exaggerated cartoon to illustrate my point. I still like the machine, though, but it can be so much greater.\n\nP.S., I still give the machine 4 stars despite my criticisms above because it is still a very unique machine and I still like it. When you love something more, you tend to chide it more, and hoping it can be great someday.";Potentially great, but SERIOUSLY HOBBLED by company lawyers
105;2.0;5.0;979.0;-3177.592777777778;"Sometimes I don't know why I'm allowed on the Internet. Sometimes I end up with a Segway miniPRO for myself... and one for the wife. Black for me, white for the missus. Impulses are cruel, cruel mistresses.\n\nSo there we are, my wife and I, this afternoon, scooting around our hardwood-floor living room, dining room and kitchen, trying not to crash into each other. I can only imagine what the neighbors would think. I also have some tire marks I need to wipe off (oops!), so bear this in mind if you're going to practice indoors! After you've been outside, PLEASE don't practice on your hard-wood  anymore - since little pieces of rock/stones will scratch up your floor!\n\nSetting up the miniPRO is incredibly simple. It comes in just two pieces. The base, and the knee steering bar. You just open the little latch on the steering bar, slide it onto the wheels section, and close the latch. That's it.\n\nPairing the device with my iPhone 6s was simple enough. As long as you have the Ninebot by Segway app installed and open, it will search for the miniPRO as soon as you hit the power button the front. Don't forget to remove the little piece of film off the front of the Segway's power button/display, or things will look a little funky when you turn the device on.\n\nWith the miniPRO on and paired, the app will run you through a quick tutorial. The tutorial itself isn't hard, but you'll find yourself wanting to hold your phone while you learn the ropes. I recommend putting the phone down after reading each tutorial, and listening for the BEEP to tell you when you've accomplished the mission. Then go back and get the phone. Alternatively, have someone else around reading your phone's miniPRO instructions/tutorial to you. In any case, it's helpful to have someone else around to scrape you off the wall if you slam into it.\n\nThe app is also fun in that it lets you customize the lighting on the miniPRO from bajillions of available colors, so have at that as you doubtless will.\n\nWith the tutorial done, maximum speed is increased, but you won't be able to hit top speed until you ride for a small distance, so take the time to get to know your miniPRO before going all out speed demon.\n\nInterestingly, it took the second time I fired up the app (after all the tutorial and house hijinks) to ask me if I wanted to upgrade the firmware to (as of July 14, 2016) version 1.3.1. The unit shipped to me with 1.2.8. There's a lot of talk on the Segway Internet about how the original firmware (1.1.7) was the best, and then 1.2.8 is... worse, and then 1.3.1 is somewhere in between. For new owners among us, we'll need to get used to a few things that maybe aren't ideal (warning beeps at max speed etc), but these are minor inconveniences rather than deal breakers. I'm sure more firmwares will get released, and hopefully the situation will improve.\n\nIn any case, hitting yes to upgrade the firmware to 1.3.1 took about 20 seconds per miniPRO, and when it was done, all was well.\n\nThese things are a total hoot to ride around on. They take some getting used to, and in the beginning you'll wonder how you'll ever get on without wobbling back and forth - but I can tell you, you will eventually make it happen. Getting off the miniPRO is much easier than getting on (at least, my wife and I definitely think so), but after a while you'll be zipping about like there's no tomorrow.\n\nI'll update when I've put on a bunch of miles, but from my short time with it so far today in and outside around my house, it's very fun, and definitely a step above your normal, cheaper hoverboards.\n\nFor the record, I'm 6'5"" and about 210lbs, with size 12 feet. I have no issue with the adjustable steering bar (raised to the top position), and my feet have plenty of space. My wife is 5'4"" and weighs *ow!, don't hit me, honey!!* -  a LOT less than me. She has no issue, though of course the steering bar is placed much lower for her on her miniPRO than on mine.\n\nThe app could use a little localization work (clearly not native English speakers in some cases), and the box could use an updates to state 220lb max weight, not the 185lb on the box it for some reason ships stating. Thankfully, Segway has been sending emails out clarifying this - to those who bought on Amazon, but still - very odd. It's fun to see, in the app, other users who have given permission to the app to view location data - there's loads of Segway/miniPRO owners around downtown Seattle, YAY! Maybe I'll run into you (hopefully not too literally) in the near future!\n\nOverall, there's a lot to like here. With a bit of app and firmware work, this is a 5 star unit. As it stands, it's awfully close!\n\n4.5 stars out of 5. Highly recommended.\n\n*UPDATE July 15, 2016*\n\nSo I've had some more time to zip around the neighborhood on my miniPRO, and I'm enjoying it more and more each time. Comfort level and ability is increasing (well, I tell myself my ability is increasing, but I might be lying to myself. I'm fine with this).\n\nA few things to note:\n\n1.) Once you get used to the fact that the gyroscopes and sensors won't try to kill you, despite what your brain is telling you, you'll do much better. I was terrified to go down any slopes, or up any inclines, initially. Interestingly, and perhaps counterintuitively, downhills are much, much simpler for me/my wife to handle. You just sit back into the soles of your feet a little, and it's no issue. You'll cruise down the hill at whatever speed you're most comfortable with. You won't even think about it. It just *happens*. It's really satisfying.\n\nUphills, though? HELP ME. They are just tricky to get the hang off. In dearest Seattle, we have a lot of hills, and going up them is a little scary at the moment, while I'm still being a newbie. If you find yourself in the unfortunate position of being stopped halfway up a hill, you'll have a tendency to lean back a little because you think you'll fall off otherwise (which isn't true, but humans think too much, occasionally). What this translates into is a (likely) short trip in reverse down the hill and into a light pole/pedestrian/car/dachshund.\n\nThankfully, I've got it to where I can actually just step off the back of the miniPRO when this happens, and nothing disastrous has happened (yet). It's probably good miniPRO etiquette (and injury preventing) to just walk your miniPRO up or down any particularly steep hills. 15 degree slopes, the manual states, are the max you should attempt. I intend to be a good miniPRO owner.\n\n2.) The headlights are fun! When you use the miniPRO at night, headlights automatically come on. For some reason, Amazon/Segway's description says: ""Customize the headlights with adjustments up to five meters."" Well, I can tell you there's no such adjustment. I believe the headlights have different levels, but they're automatic based on ambient light availability. I wonder if the ""customize"" part has been lost in translation to English somewhere along the way...\n\n3.) The app has some really fun tail light adjustments, and at night they look positively awesome. I've currently got my tail lights doing the KITT from Knight Rider hood light pulsing thing, and quite frankly that's as close to being David Hasselhoff as I'm likely to get, for better or worse.\n\n4.) AVOID CURBS! Ask me how I know. Actually, don't. But please, curbs are not your friends.\n\n5.) I felt like a bit of an attention hound while scooting around the neighborhood with my wife. Pedestrians would stop and stare, and drivers would look back as they passed us. It was fun, until my wife noted that it's not because I'm ""cool"", but much more likely because I look like a total idiot, all 6'5"" of me, rolling down the sidewalk on this tiny contraption. Well whatever. What does she know...\n\n*UPDATE, July 17, 2016*\n\n1.) I've now mastered uphills to a great degree (pun intended)! I trust the machine enough to come to a complete stop at the base of a hill, and then lean into the uphill, and wheeeeee - there I go! Incredibly satisfying!\n\n2.) The greatest difficulty I now have is changing direction significantly when going up steep uphills or downhills. I need to work on that some, but it's coming along, slowly but surely!\n\n3.) This thing is impossible to ride anywhere without people stopping you to chat about it. That's fine, but sometimes I'd just like to ride! LET ME RIDE!\n\n4.) I'm plotting Halloween already. I'm going to don a ghost outfit that comes down to just above the wheels, and scoot along the sidewalks, scaring everyone. This might be the greatest Halloween scare-maker EVER, especially since your hands are completely free to wave around in a spooky manner. Oh yes.\n\n*UPDATE, August 2, 2016*\n\nLike. A. Boss. I'm a pro at this now, and it's officially my grocery-getter. The missus and I fling a thin backpack on our respective backs, and there we go, trundling (like two bosses, of course) to get our groceries from the store a few miles away. We tend to be respectful in the store, and haven't zoomed about inside (not sure I want to find out how that will go...), and we use the pull-out handle to walk the miniPRO along next to us. If both of us go, I usually walk both miniPROs while the wifey deals with the shopping cart.\n\nSome things to note!\n\n1.) It seems like the 220lb weight limit is designed more for the uphill ""issue"" than anything else. Because my wife weighs... ahem... so much less, she can definitely scoot uphill faster than I can. Not that I'm complaining - it's certainly fast enough for me. On flats we both hit the same max speed, and if you act silly and try to push the device faster than it's designed, it will give you a warning beep before tilting back slightly to tell you NO! BAD RIDER! BAD! The tilting back has never once been an issue. It beeps, you stop being a twit on your miniPRO, and all is well. If you IGNORE the beeps, - apparently heaven help you, because the miniPRO will launch you into outer space. Because it's PRO.\n\nSo here's my explanation of what's going on here, and why this seems to have a bunch of people crying, calling shenanigans and throwing their miniPROs in the trash:\n\nFirst, there's a LOT going on inside the unit to keep you balanced. Numerous sensors all working in tandem to keep you upright. Quite frankly, it's brilliant it works at all. Now, the unit is clearly designed to work within ""parameters."" Part of that is based on how quickly it can keep you balanced based on the speed you're moving, how much you weigh etc. It's pretty easy to keep the unit at max speed without the beeps getting in the way. You learn to lean forward just as much as is necessary, without going ""over the edge."" If you're ""misbehaving"" and leaning FAR too far forward, the unit is going to beep, and lean you back. It's only possible to be thrown off if you're leaning way too far forward, ignoring the beeps, and that is 100% user error. It HAS to lean back to prevent you from tilting the unit far too far forward and having an accident that way because of being outside the parameters of the miniPRO's ability to balance you. Again, if you are leaning too far forward and the unit beeps at you, you're doing something wrong.\n\nHere's an example that's a little less obvious: Going up a hill:\n\nYou'll tend to lean forward a little more as you go up a hill. Nothing wrong with that. However, when you get to the top of the hill and the terrain becomes flat, you'll be leaning too far forward for a flat surface, and the unit will beep at you and lean back. No accidents here, of course, because when you hear the beeps you have plenty of time to sit back in your heels and avoid the unit chastising you. :-) Once you attain awareness of how the system works, it's so easy to modulate and know when you're being bad. In this case, you'll ease off the leaning forward as you reach the crest of the hill, and there will be no beepy beeps!\n\nNow, when you're on a glass-smooth surface, you may REALLY want to go ZOOM! My wife constantly teases me because I'll try and push the unit faster than it can go, and ... BEEP BEEP BEEP! And yep, behind me my wife will yell, ""STOP BEING AN IDIOT!"" Of course, that kind of truth is hard to deal with for me, so I usually yell back, ""I CAN'T HELP IT!"" Whatever. She's right. She's always right.\n\n2.) There's not much to do in terms of maintenance, but I do recommend checking the following things every now and then:\n\na.) The latch that the knee bar attaches with. The latch should be pretty firm to close. If it's not, there's a chance you can lift the knee bar right out of the base when lifting it up. So just give those two screws under the latch a bit of a turn to tighten that locking mechanism up. You'll know it's too tight when you can't close the latch, so loosen them a tad at this point. Firm is key.\n\nb.) The knee bar also has 4 allen key screws under the warning label halfway down. Peel that sticker off (it doesn't make a mess, thank you, thank you, thank you), and tighten those 4 screws. If you have some blue Loctite, throw some on there because those screws NEVER need to be loose. If they do become loose, you'll notice the top part of the knee bar is a little wobbly, whether it's extended or not. For reference, I had to do this fix on both mine and my wife's miniPRO. She insists my screws are looser than hers, BUT WHAT DOES SHE KNOW!?\n\nc.) There's a red rubber plug at the base of the unit where the knee bar connects. You can pop that plug out with your fingers, and tighten those two screws up, if things are a little loose there.\n\nd.) Check your tire pressures! There's still some confusion about various number-y things with the miniPROs as they reached the USA officially. First, is the weight limit - which is 220lbs, not 185lbs, as addressed earlier. Second? Tire pressures. The tires say max 30 PSI. But Segway recommends 45 PSI. That's quite a difference. 30 PSI definitely seems a little low, and makes the tires much more squishy than I'd like, so I'd put them at ~40 PSI and be happy.\n\nOK, time for a ride. ZOOM!\n\n*UPDATE, September 9, 2016*\n\nDisaster struck yesterday! I noticed my left tire on my miniPRO was reading much lower than it normally is. I tested it - 19 PSI. OH NOES!!! I pumped it up to Segway's recommended 45 PSI and this morning it had dropped again to around 20 PSI. I hunted around the wheel and noticed a small tear in the face of the tire. A quick test with some soapy water (a few drops on the suspected puncture will show bubbles as the air is released from the tire into the soapy water) revealed that yes - my Segway has a puncture! WHAT TO DO!?\n\nWell, the fix is actually pretty simple and cheap! The miniPRO uses tubeless tires, so what you'll want is this cheap kit:\n\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slime-1034-A-T-Handle-Tire-Plug-Kit/dp/B000ET525K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slime 1034-A T-Handle Tire Plug Kit</a>\n\nYou can YouTube the simple installation for this (videos everywhere showing you how - but the instructions are pretty simple as it is), and yep - my puncture is now repaired in under 2 minutes. Much better than having to send the unit into Segway. This repair style is approved by Segway's tech support. I even called to make sure!\n\nAnyway, there you go. My Segway is back in action, which is GOOD, because I was going to go through withdrawal, and my darling wife was going to tease me endlessly as she ventured out into the great beyond (usually the grocery store) without me. She really has no problems abandoning me to head out on miniPRO adventures. In her defense, she did offer that I could run behind her. THANKS, HONEY.\n\n*UPDATE* December 19, 2017\n\nminiPROs are still going strong in this household, and we love them! We've managed to get countless friends to buy these contraptions, so if you ever see a battalion of miniPROs (a gaggle of geese, a flock of birds, a battalion of miniPROs) zipping around West Seattle, it's likely my wife and I and our miniPRO homies.\n\nSo here's an update to address the elephant in the room, and that is Segway's 2018 Segway miniPRO. What improvements has Segway brought to the table here? Well...\n\nFor this update, we're going to call the ""original"" miniPRO (this one you're looking at) - the 2016 miniPRO, and the 2018 miniPRO we're going to call the... uhh... 2018 miniPRO.\n\nThe 2016 miniPRO has a larger battery, - at 310Wh, vs 236Wh on the 2018 miniPRO. This translates to less range on this latest revision (around 12% more range on the 2016). 14 miles versus 12.5 miles, under the same conditions.\n\nYep, that's it. Given the 2016 model is very often sold by Amazon for the exact same price as the 2018 model, please don't buy the 2018 model unless you're desperate. There are zero other differences. Why, Segway? Why you do dis?";Worth it. Really, really worth it (now with a small comparison to the 2018 miniPRO).
134;3.0;5.0;811.0;-348.81402810304445;Early review from an early adopter... I'll update this later. This is a fantastic product, and such an improvement over the original Segway I purchased from Amazon back in 2003! I rode my first Segway to work for about 3 years, then sold it for what I paid for it to a 52 year old woman in Australia who had polio as a child and had never been able to leave her house on her own - not on foot, bike, car, bus, etc. - until she got her Segway and suddenly she was mobile for the first time in her life. Then I bought two more and rode those for about 3 years.\n\nUnlike a hoverboard, these are EPAMDs - electronic personal assistive mobility devices - and in many states are legal to use anywhere a wheelchair is allowed, which is about anywhere. Here in Arizona, I was one of the people who helped get this law passed, and helped local malls, airports, zoos, parks, office buildings, grocery stores, etc., etc. understand the usefulness and legality of these devices. Again, these are legal anywhere a wheelchair is allowed in many states... including Arizona.\n\nFor people with mobility disabilities, this is an amazing alternative to a wheelchair... you're not at crotch level, you're not looked down to, people don't give you 'fake-nice' greetings or compassion conversations, etc. Unlike a wheelchair it can go through sand, gravel, grass, mud, really steep inclines/declines (while even keeping you level!), and even shorter steps and curbs pretty easily. And understand, there are a lot of people who refuse to use wheelchairs due to the social stigma, the hassle, the humiliation, the self-defeat... not just people who are paralyzed, but people with foot/knee/leg/hip injuries who just grin-and-bear pain.\n\nRegardless if you're mobility-disabled or able-bodied, this is a great, great, great tool... not a toy, it's truly an alternative to transportation for many people. This is the Segway that was meant to be. Please, for the sake of those with mobility challenges, don't rag on this product... it has a lot of real world applications. It is not another hoverboard. This is entirely different, and it has the possibility to change the world for the better - we need to stop being addicted to knee-jerk negative reactions to new things and learn about them, think about them, understand them and embrace them. Please, for the sake of our fellow mobility disabled brothers and sisters, understand that this is a product that can change lives.;Great alternative to a wheelchair... not just a toy... also great short-distance transportation solution!

Instead of investing in a new battery, I opted for this MiniPro.\n\nGLIDING INDOORS\nSo far I've used it indoors most. It took me a little while to get comfortable stepping on the platform without grabbing onto something.\n\nIn the freight area of my building, there are long hallways and small slopes. Gliding down the slopes is equivalent to the i2 in that you feel upright and comfortable (not like you're leaning into a face plant). However, gliding up took more effort.\n\nGLIDING OUTDOORS\nNext, I took it outdoors in NYC. The sidewalk was perfectly paved and uncrowded. A moderate wind started pushing me slightly toward an oncoming pedestrian. I was able to push away but the brief experience made me nervous. I went back indoors to practice more.\n\nPORTABILITY\nIt's heavy to pick up. I don't see myself carrying this anywhere up/down stairs -- only rolling on ramps.\n\nTHE REMOTE\nI'm not a gamer, so maybe that's why it's a challenge for me. I was crashing it into everything :)\n\nSEGWAY PT i2 COMPARISON\nThe MiniPro isn't supposed to be equivalent to the i2, I'm sure, but there are awesome similarities. Being able to turn in place and the feeling of just gliding around is really nice and fun. Outdoors so far, I still feel more comfortable with my lean steer, but that may change with time.\n\nREGULATION\nI believe that the smaller MP is pedestrian-friendly, so I am optimistic about local use regulations *fingers crossed*\n\nFUN TIPS:\nI use a gimble with the Segway Mini Pro for ultra smooth videos.\n\nFor airing the tires, I use a Mega Morph brand tire pump with the cone-shaped attachment that comes with it.\n\nCONCLUSION\nI'm happy with the MiniPro. It has exceeded my expectations. I don't see it as a replacement for my big Segway, but it's a keeper.\n\nI'll revise my review over time after I've ridden outdoors longer.";Segway i2 Owner's Perspective

I work 3 miles from home so I rode it to work today. It takes me 10 minutes to drive, 15 ride the bike, and 20-25 minutes with the Segway. This thing goes uphill effortless.

After another month of trying to decide what to do with my segway (sell it for $25, try to repair battery, spend almost the purchase price for a new battery), a realization came to mind. It could be that the battery voltage is just slightly below some threshold of the charger and I may be able to manually charge it with another charger. I removed and tested the battery voltage. I can't remember the exact voltage, but I think it was in the mid to low 40's or around 3.0V/cell. I believe this is a 14S battery, so that voltage is low, but not necessarily dangerously low assuming all cells equal. I directly connected via test leads another charger with higher voltage and around 1.5A max current. The led light immediately started blinking on the battery. I let it charge a couple minutes while monitoring with my Flir One thermal camera. I then connected the battery to the original charger. The battery fully charged in a matter of hours while I monitored for overheating. Everything now seems back to normal; however I will keep in mind the possibility that at least one of the cells is damaged and continue to monitor the charging process. I'd like to think that the pack includes cell balancing/monitoring and would report battery health issues to the app.\n\nMaintaining 1 star rating due to lack of battery support.

I'm well aware of the importance of lithium battery maintenance. After getting over the initial novelty, I placed my miniPro in storage and checked the battery every couple months. I initially found little self discharge, so after charging and storing for 6 months I pulled it out to check the battery. To my surprise, the miniPro was completely dead and would not take a charge. I tried the recovery procedure by removing the battery and connecting to charger, but no luck.  I now have a choice between trashing it or spending over $300 for a new battery.\n\nIt's a cool novelty item that's fun to learn and show off to friends at first, but really has no practical purpose. The top speed is somewhat awkward for traveling any distance as you're going slower than you feel like you should be going and you have to try to hold it just below the top speed or it will keep beeping at you and braking. You're leaning slightly forward, which adds to the awkwardness. Standing in the same position for more than a few minutes gets uncomfortable pretty quickly. With the range, I thought this could potentially be used for commuting and getting around a downtown area, but the combination of awkwardness and weight made me uncomfortable with that.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the way these things react to obstacles. I hit a 1"" lip/step on a surface that the miniPro handled just fine at low speed. I hit it again going a little faster and it got stuck for a split second. I thought for that split second that I was going to end up stepping off the front, not a big deal, but the miniPro suddenly summoned all its torque and launched forward. This both pushed me up into the air and took my feet out from under me. I landed on my mid-back with my body still somewhat folded. It knocked the wind out of me, but luckily I didn't hit my head. The miniPro remained upright throughout this experience. Always keep in mind that these things can react violently in an attempt to remain level.";Recovered my dead battery!

Upon some investigation, the Internet forum was filled with complaints about the ""speed punishment"" feature that was implemented in recent firmware of miniPRO. What this ""feature"" does is that when you drive over the speed limit, it will tilt back to force you to slow down. The intention is great, but so far its implementation is severely flawed. The tilting threw many riders off balance and caused them to fall off the unit, so this ""safety feature"" becomes the very thing that makes miniPRO ""unsafe"". I didn't know about this until I experienced it today and then saw the many complaints online. So this unit is going back to Amazon.

The first time I stepped onto it, I had the wobbles for just few seconds and it took me about 30 seconds to feel secure and trust that it would stay upright. Within minutes, I was feeling pretty confident on it and within the hour, it felt as natural as walking. It feels really well made and the ride is super smooth. I thought the bar in the middle might be difficult or awkward to steer with with but it feels very natural.\n\nI put my roommate on it last night and he had the same experience. Took him just a couple of minutes to really get settled into it but then he was zipping around too.\n\nThis is easily the best money I have ever wasted on something I don't need.

I wish the max speed was just a bit higher as I find myself always getting beeped at when I don't think I'm going all that fast and\n2. I wish there some way to easily attach a bike lock. The locking feature doesn't actually prevent anyone from walking away with it.\n3.

The reason why I put that in caps is because it's upsetting and annoying. 10mph is not fast at all. The speed restrictions need to be removed because the device is very well capable to going faster than 10mph. I bought his on prime day for $699 but it's going back for the sole reason that it's speed controlled. I'll pay the full price for it once it actually does what it's supposed without all these dumb features. The disclaimer for self injury is already on the box.

However, the experience has been quite pleasant that I decided to keep it. The setup experience was quite simple: connect knee control bar to base, download app, and that's it! I've never been on a hover-board or a Segway before, so I was worried about the learning curve. It really just took me less than 30mins to feel comfortable on it.\n\nIt did take some calmness and confidence, but the end result was great (YMMV). I am a very discerning customer when it comes to electronics, but the quality of materials is top notch, and I was impressed as soon as I took it out of the box. I have been riding it around the local park, and around the neighborhood of my office location when I need to move between buildings for meetings.

The actual build quality and functionality is wonderful.  The item performs very well but once you get a flat ... good luck trying to fix it.  I just can't believe with the amount of money you invest in this equipment - there is no easy fix for something as simple as a leaking tire.  The leak wasn't cause by a puncture - it has to do with the sealing around the tire rim.\n\nYou cannot use an inner tube, as the tire has none.  I tried the ""fix a flat"" pump option but that does not address the air leaking issue caused by a faulty seal between the wheel rim and tire.  After hours of research online, emailing Segway and now I did try to call their main customer service number and got an answering machine ...

100;14.0;3.0;59.0;-76.72839378238338;I'd really like to like the Segway but when you go on a ride more than a mile the unit will slow you down after you reach 10 miles per hour.  Several times it slowed me down from 10 mph to 3-4mph, mind you, while it is slowing you down the unit is angled backwards.  This action causes you to lean forward even more.\n\nThen around mile 3-4 the unit slowed the top speed from 10 mph down to 8.6 mph. I was monitoring from the phone the entire time. I'm sure Segway did this to reach the 14 mile distance but after fighting with the unit going slower then speeding up and getting thrown off twice.  I didn't do the update and still using 1.28 version.  Really disappointed because I did plan on using this for round trips shorter then 10 miles but the unit just cannot handle a long trip.\n\nI am keeping it for a while, in hopes that a update fixes these issues.

71;16.0;2.0;56.0;-462.9349999999999;"SO CLOSE TO 5 STARS. It's well made, attractive and seriously fun to ride. But... And it's a big but... Some, I assume misguided lawyer,  decided to force code written into the programming that stomps this sled into reverse when you exceed 10 miles per hour, or if you excellrate too quickly. Now, once you get used to riding this... Which is very quickly since it's so intuitive, you'll be able to both excellerate quickly and with ease, and hit 10mph within seconds. I know for a fact, they could write code and update this so that instead of beeping and slamming on the brakes at 10mph, it could just get to the allowed top speed and then maintain a soft cruise at that speed. Imagine getting to 70 in your car and then instead of being able to set the cruise, the car just repeatedly braked everytime you hit 71, pulling you back to 60...then you must gas it until you get back up there and repeat this for your entire commute, forcing you into this weird dance of constant excelleration and deceleration. And this board doesn't allow you to set a cruise speed at say... 9mph, so it expects you to intuitively ""know""  that you're approaching 10mph... good luck with that, especially on Hills. You must think, so consistently, about what speed you're at in an attempt to not exceed 10mph and get thrown backwards that it ruins the entire experience. No joke... Change this one GLARING and unnecessary issue and this unit is 5 stars across the board. The only other small issue is that it requires an app to run correctly. It works well though, tells you distance, speed, battery, allows you to use the board remotely... The issue is that it sucks battery on your phone, and it's REALLY difficult to pay attention to the app and still ride safely. But considering the speed issue, you're constantly staring at the app to see what speed you're at to avoid the punishment delivered when exceeding 10mph, so much so  that you never watch the road. Bad mojo. You should be able to bypass the app entirely and just use the board once you've passed the initial practice trials. (assuming you haven't locked the security alarm obviously). Now in all fairness, you can start the app, Mount the board, turn the screen off on your phone and put it in your pocket and everything works as usual... But the app is still running, bleeding phone battery at a frantic pace and cranking my phones internal temp to 200 degrees. That's just a small issue though, and would not reduce my review of the board. It's good looking, well made, fun and easy to ride,  stable... Everything you'd want... Fix the  nonstop back/forth dance from 6mph to 10mph that I have to do and just let me cruise at top speed and I'll change this to 5 stars. Come on Segway... Everyone has the same complaint. It's going to get someone hurt.. As a career Advanced Life Support Paramedic I can tell you this is really bad, dangerous programming.

114;18.0;5.0;50.0;-80.8403389830508;Very impressed with this product.  We are in our mid-fifties and this was a breeze to learn to ride.  Perhaps 5 or 10 minutes until you feel fairly comfortable.  And in a short time after that, you are able to maneuver without issue.  Biggest learning tip is to RELAX when you get on the miniPRO.  Your instinct is to try to balance on it when what you really want to do is just stand there and relax -- the Segway does the balancing.  The faster you relax - the faster you learn to ride.  Have had grandkids (ages 8, 11 and 16) on it as well -- obviously while under supervision, in a park and away from danger.  The 8 year old was the quickest learner and she was amazing on it.  Carries my 201 pounds well and all components feel sturdy and of high quality.  This is not a cheap product, but you'll have a lot of fun with it.  Only suggestion for Segway - put a camera on it and make the remote bluetooth control capability more fun.;Old or young - this is a well made product that's fun to use
118;19.0;5.0;45.0;-181.5151408450704;As an original Segway owner could not resist to buy not one but two (wife got the white one) Segway miniPro. The fit and finish of the unit is Segway quality. The interface to the iPhone is awesome even giving you live speedometer as you ride.\n\nGetting on the Segway is a little harder than the original Segway but after you get used to this no issues (always mount and dismount from the back or the Segway). Also remember that as you ride you have about 4 inches on each side of you (wheels) so make a wider corner :)\n\nThe power of the motors is great. I am 6'3 215 lbs and no issue going up a hill. Once you get used to riding - took me about 10 mins no issue in stability.\n\nBattery power is great. Only thing I would love to see would be maybe a kickstand on the front like the original Segway had as an option.\n\nThis is not a child's toy but instead a mobility device.\n\nThe problem I had with the new Segway miniPro was that my wife wanted her own! So guess what we have both a black and white one!\n\nIt is important to note that the speed is limited for the first bit while you get used to it and keep this in mind when riding any distance as you will have a tendency to speed up and with the speed limited you will start to feel the Segway tilting back as you reach the speed limit.\n\nVery impressed with the new Segway miniPro - love the weight 20lbs verse over 60 lbs for the original Segway.;Segway 2.0 - Awesome!

I checked the charger with a multimeter and got an irregular reading so I opened up the transformer on the charging unit to attempt to diagnose. What I found was surprising. Someone in the manufacturing process got a little aggressive with the circuit board adhesive and squirted it all over the electrical components of the board. Appeared to be vindictive. Needless to say, I don't have any expectation I'll ever get a charge out of this unit. I've reached out to Segway but they do not provide customer support on weekends so I will attempt again soon.

Well hopefully. We mailed it back two weeks ago and still haven't received it back. In the mean time we ordered him another one to use and that way he could have two. When we received his second one the Segway would be fully charged and die completely within thirty minutes. So we mailed this one back and asked for a replacement. Today we received that replacement and it came with a faulty tire that won't hold air. So now this one is headed back. Extremely disappointed with the recent quality in these.

But I wanted to alert potential buyers about a control problem that has cause me to have two serious crashes so far.\n\nWhen traveling down a steep hill, there is a definite ""shimmy"" in the way the Segway manages braking.  It is severe enough that it has caused me to either lose control or get thrown off it.  While descending a steep grade, the Segway can make uncommanded small turns to the left or right.  This in turn, can cause the rider's knees to bump to steering bar, which then causes an even larger sudden turn in the opposite direction.\n\nIn one case, I have been forced off the side of the path I was traveling and hit a tree.  In another case, I was thrown off the Segway resulting in a fall where I tumbled downhill head-over-heels.\n\nAnother annoyance is that Segway has not upgraded their mobile software to support Android 7.0 (Nougat) - it just crashes; leaving me unable to take advantage of any firmware updates.\n\nComplaints to the company have gone un-answered.\n\nCorrection: The Android App now works on Android 7.0 as of October 2016.";Fun - but Control Issues can Cause Crashes

I had wanted a full size Segway for a long time, but couldn't justify the expense. This one went on sale during Amazon's recent Prime Day bringing the price down to $699 from $999. I thought this one would be a good alternative for that price.\n\nThe item was promised in two days under the Prime two day shipping guarantee. Instead, the item arrived in four days. I note that in case you are trying to meet a specific deadline for arrival.\n\nIt comes in a relatively small box about 2 1/2 feet by 2 1/2 feet. Very easy to pick up and move around. Inside the box was a second brown box and inside that was the Segway box. The Segway comes in three parts...the wheels and standing platform, the knee brace, and the accessory box containing the power cord, a valve stem extension air inflation hose for the tires, Quick Start instructions, regular instructions (which didn't include much more information) and two replacement discs for the side of the wheels (see the red and grey lines in the product picture).\n\nI'm techno and sporty so the setup was pretty easy. The Segway was delivered all charged up so I was riding around in my living room and kitchen within 30 minutes. You first need to download the Segway app from the Apple or Android store. The instructions seem to indicate this is an absolute requirement. I don't know for sure because I did download and use the app. Once you do, then you need to register your Segway using the app. Then you need to pair your Segway to the app (mine had difficulty making and keeping a Bluetooth connection between my Android S6 and the Segway which doubled the setup time). Then you need to update the firmware for the Segway using the app. Then you need to slide the knee bar into place and tighten the adjustment knob (no tools required). Setup is then complete.\n\nThe instructions are not really helpful. For example, after installing the knee bar, it says you should adjust the bar ""to desired height"" but it does not tell you what height it should be. In other words, where should the bar be located...below your knees, low on your knees, even on your knees, above your knees. It doesn't say. Both instruction books are that simple and basic. I should note that the knee bar easily adjusts up or down with the twist of a knob. No tools required.\n\nThe instructions listed some limitations that I should note because they are not apparent in the sales literature. It says the riders must be between 85-185 pounds (40-85 kg) and must be 4'3 to 6'6 (130-200 cm) tall. 185 pounds is not that heavy for a normal adult American male. I am 183 and the Segway seemed to operate fine, but be aware of that limitation. It also said that the device is only for people between 16 and 60 years old (given that I feel I am quickly approaching 60, that limitation bugged me a little bit). My tiny 4'0 tall eight year old daughter rode it just fine, but the manual says she shouldn't get to ride it. Try telling her that. The bar did stick high up in her crotch, but she was able to control it on a level, concrete surface just fine. My 11 year old athletic boy was riding it like a pro within five minutes of getting on it. The instructions also go over a long list of stuff you shouldn't ride over...basically, it wants you to stick to level concrete. I have to admit, hitting a speed bump or hole or even a slightly raised bit of concrete would cause some balance issues, but it is a limitation you should keep in mind and is not that big of an issue if you have good balance. I should note that you're not supposed to let the Segway get wet in any way, including riding through puddles. That could be a problem if you live somewhere with a lot of frequent rain.\n\nAfter the setup is complete and you've read the instruction manuals, it is time to step on the Segway. It is neat because when the power is on, the Segway automatically balances itself. When the power goes off, it turns on its side like a robot would that just lost power. The Segway app takes you through a training program. During this program, the speed is limited to 4.3 mph (7 km/h). You have to go forward and backward and turn around in a complete circle both left and right. Then you have to ride for 10 meters. It is kind of like the setup routine at the beginning of Halo on the Xbox if you're familiar with that game. The tutorial is then complete.\n\nI took my Segway outside and completed the setup by riding on a level concrete street for 0.6 miles (1 km). If you have to move the Segway by hand, you have to pick it up using the knee pads bar. There is another plastic bar that can be pulled out of the top of the knee bar if you need to steer the device without riding it. This option was okay, but a little awkward. It was easier to just pick it up if it needed to be moved short distances.\n\nDuring the first 0.6 miles, the speed was limited to 6.2 mph (10 km/h). After that distance was complete, I was able to disable the speed limitation using the app and reach the maximum speed of 10 mph (16 km/h). Within an hour of opening the box, I was riding full speed on both a level and hilly concrete street with no feeling of uneasiness. I was also able to go up and down a sloped gravel driveway and across grass at a slow speed.\n\nThe app lets me set the speed limit for the Segway, customize the color of the rear light bars, turn on or off the front and rear lights, and activate remote control mode. The app and instructions are not helpful about figuring out how to set and change the lights. Trial and error is what I have done so far. The remote control mode didn't seem to work very well...the Segway wouldn't move forward or back in response to my remote commands, just turn in a circle, but I haven't played with it a lot yet.\n\nWhen riding, the Segway will start to lean backwards on its own if you hit the maximum speed for more than a few seconds. That bothers me a little bit because it throws off my balance, especially if I'm leaning forward to go up a hill or leaning backwards already to go down a hill. However, I didn't fall down.\n\nThe wheels have a little notch to them to help when riding over anything but level concrete, but they are not really intended to go off road. Short, even grass or level dirt or small sized gravel would be the most I would venture to ride over with these tires.\n\nOverall, I am very pleased with the Segway. As my daughter excitedly said, it is the best thing since sliced bread. She declared after seeing it that she will never walk anywhere again. I agree, it looks like it will be a lot of fun in the right locations. I think I would still like to have the handlebar of a full size Segway, particularly when going over rough terrain or obstacles. But this was 10% of that price, so I got what I paid for. Plus, it hasn't caught fire like other hover boards and I trust this manufacturer so I am not really worried about that particular problem.";Initial thoughts after taking the Segway out of the box

I am sure that this unit will last just as long as my orginal Segway back from 2003, it just feels like it been well engineered. My first hours with it was a late evening after a long hard day, and really I wanted to go to bed, but with a newly release Segway sitting in front of me, I could not waste any time checking it out. So at 11:45 pm at night I took this for a good night time ride right in to the wooded trails and put 5 miles on it in the dark wooded trails and. It was awesome, built in headlights, build in break lights, even turn signals. It is under 30 lbs and easy to pick up and load in my truck and even a quick an easy way to remove the steering arm. It feels just like my first Segway which was awesome. This Segway they put some thought in to the little extras to make this better then ever, it is just awesome!\n\nAs you can imagine I had a number of people ask me about this and if they can try it, and for most it was surprising to see in just 30 seconds, people are adapting to this like they are riding a bike, and it becomes second nature to them in just minutes and for some it is seconds.\n\nThe price of this Segway is much more realistic compared to the big Segway and it does not weight in at 85 lbs,  it is under 30 lbs and really easy to pack up and take with you anywhere. And you can bet this unit will be with me for most of my travels because of the weight which was an issue with my 2006 Segway because of 85+ lbs and size.\n\nMy only draw back with this and my other Segways, is that standing without really moving your feet can wear you out if you are on it for miles. You got to get off and walk a little to get the feeling back in to your feet, and then you are good to go again. You need to good feeling shoes on that you know you could stand in place with them for a long time, because that is just about what you are doing here on the Segway/NineBot!\n\nIf you are a camera buff, taking moving videos on this is awesome because you can keep the camera steady and you are not moving a walking pace, but much faster!\n\nThis NineBot/Sayway is going to make history I am sure simply because it is affordable, well built, safe and very enjoyable to ride. It will not be long before we see clones of this one, but they will not have the long solid history of a Segway, and I bet it will not last as log as this Segway. My investment on my 2003 Segways have been well worth it,  and that is what drive me to buy another Segway item! My 2003 Segways are still going strong!;It's the next generation Segway!
34;26.0;4.0;28.0;-719.8152985074626;"A comparison between 2 options for personal mobility: Segway miniPRO vs. Jetson V8&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jetson-V8-Self-Balancing-Scooter/dp/B01JUB7H3M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jetson V8 Self Balancing Scooter</a>&nbsp;(a.k.a. Epikgo)\n\nBoth are HEAVY.  Not unmanageable, but heavier than you think, especially if you've tried the ""toy"" versions.  The weight has to be considered if you plan to lug it with you into places that don't allow riding it.\n\nSIZE matters!  The weight is matched by their size.  Take a look at the pics!  These devices are not toys.\n\nHow's the RIDE?\nminiPRO - is more forgiving to first time riders.  The ""knee-bar-joystick"" logically separates the steering action from the forward/backward action of the footboard.  First timers can just concentrate on ""balance"" (getting familiar with board trying to compensate for imbalance - front to back) and just work on moving forward & backward.  Next step is to lean the ""knee-bar-joystick"" left or right to turn the Segway.  Finally, combine the two actions and you're good.\n\nThe ride is what you'd expect - you're on wheels!  Remember the first time you learned to ride a bike?  Same.  Then it becomes second nature.  There is a level of ""luxury"" (probably just my imagination) that comes from the larger wheels and the effective balance algorithm employed by the Segway - this is a bonus for first-time riders.  My 9-year old is able to mount/dismount with trepidation and even then the Segway is working to keep her steady.  Again, more forgiving.  The footboard area is larger (front to back) than most other devices, which makes the ride experience even more confident feeling - the wife preferred the miniPRO over the Jetson because of this perception.\n\nThe APP is okay if you like your phone battery to be drained faster that you've ever seen.  Read the other reviews for more details.  You have access to the settings and dashboard information.  Once you set it all up you don't need it if you just wanna ride the thing.  The ""speed restriction"" and ""auto lean back"" annoyances that everyone has talked about - not an issue for me - I've not encountered them - and I'm guessing it's in the firmware of the machine and not in the code of the app.  Temper this with my status: I'm a cautious/casual rider who just enjoys being transported on a novel device.  The device definitely feels like it will do more, but we are not those type of riders.\n\nSegway minPRO - Bottom Line: It's fun! Easy to learn & ride!\n\nJetson V8 (a.k.a. Epikgo) - a tank version of the ""toy"" hover boards everyone has seen and tried.  The drive action is the same: steering AND forward/backward action are controlled by the angle of both feet/stance simultaneously.  It takes an addition level of concentration to keep the two actions in sync, especially for first-time riders.  It's less forgiving for those not familiar with concept and haven't yet developed the dexterity to master an enjoyable ride.  It's easy to learn, but the learning curve can be unsettling & steep for those who have trouble with balance & coordination - just watch those fail-hover board videos.\n\nJetson V8 - Bottom line:  FUN, but be ready to take a spill if you have trouble with coordination AND balance simultaneously.  Rugged and it will show its abuse quickly.  (The fenders scrape the ground when its pivoted too far or when you wipe out.)\n\nCOMPARISON:\nJetson is more rugged, more parts made of metal (like the fenders).  Segway has plastic fenders and I wouldn't feel good about it being dropped or hitting objects - feels like the parts will break or crack much sooner than the Jetson.  The Jetson is a tank, where as the Segway is a passenger car.  Both will stand up to regular use, but the Jetson feels like it will take more abuse.\n\nThe Segway is better for beginners and will grow with more advance riders.  The Jetson does have a beginner setting, but the overall ride experience requires more coordination & balance especially when learning - the fun begins with the advanced setting - no limitations other than the inherent restriction, no nanny!\n\nGet them both!  We purchased both during the Black Friday and Today's Deals sales.  They were the same price at the time so it was a good opportunity to try/buy them both at (599) each.\n\nWe are keeping both... they each have their quirks and differ in ride experience based on rider ability.  Each gets 1-star deducted for intrusive APP experience & battery drain (Segway & Jetson) and restriction annoyances (Segway) - but for the sale price it's all well worth it!  They're both FUN!";COMPARED to Jetson V8 (Epikgo)

I, and the rest of my family love it and feel completely safe using it. I will film a video and post it later to show you just how amazing and easy it is to use in case you have any doubts about it. I wanted to put up a review, so I decided to look at what other reviews there are about this Segway. I then sorted reviews based on ratings and date. When I went to the one star reviews, I saw two reviews posted by two different people that were copied from each other word for word. I then looked at some of the other negative reviews and thought this is not right. Whoever is doing this has an agenda and I guarantee you is a competitor of Segway that is trying to make this product not desirable. This is by far the best scooter ever. You cant compare it to the hover boards. Its technology is superior and designed with safety in mind. Simply put, it is fabulous! I highly recommend it.";This 5-star product does NOT deserve fake negative reviews!!!
124;29.0;5.0;32.0;-420.0290909090909;This is amazing!  It came neatly packed, had that fresh off the line smell, the owner's manual and warranty information came in a white envelope like that of Apple products.  I downloaded the Ninebot app, registered and paired my miniPRO in less than 5 minutes.  You must go through a tutorial, which is mostly safety information, and that took under 5 minutes.  Next, the app will take you through actually learning to use the miniPRO.  It will que you to step on, make full turns right and left, go forward 10 meters, step off and how to pick up the unit and set it down correctly. Now, you must go another .6 miles at a restricted speed of 6.2mph  before the app allows the unit to go the full 10mph.\n\nThere is a bit of a learning curve, but once you've been on it for a few minutes, you will get the hang of it, then everything becomes very natural and intuitive.  The tricky part for me was stepping on the unit for the first time, you must step on top of the footpad with your center of gravity directly on top of the unit or else it will wobble.  This will take a few times to get right for some people.  Turning left and right is very quick and responsive. When you're going backwards, be careful not to turn too quickly or else you will lose your balance.\n\nAfter a few minutes of practicing inside, I took it outside for a spin.  I have already gone .6 miles inside and can now go 10mph if I wanted to.  I spent a few minutes going up and down my driveway to get a feel for slopes, it performed nicely, the only thing about going downhill is to not turn too quickly or else you will lose your balance.  I went around the block a few times, going slow and fast, and believe me, the unit seems to fly when you're reaching top speed of 10mph.  It will start to beep once you are around top speed, that means slow down.  The lights are bright and pretty, especially the back led ones.  The front ones have sensors and will come on as needed, they did not come on while I was practicing inside, but once I was outside in the dark, they were on and were bright, reaching about 6 feet in front of you.\n\nThe tires do not have any suspension, so be careful when riding over uneven cracks and bumps, they felt pretty jarring.  It will help to bend your knees a little and relax as you're hitting little bumps, as this will cushion the impact a little.  I'm a little concerned this will knock things loose inside the unit over time.  My battery showed full when I turned the unit on for the first time, and full after about 30 minutes of continuous use.\n\nSo all in all, I'm very happy with my purchase.  Everything is working as advertised.  Happy riding and enjoy!;This is amazing! It came neatly packed
57;30.0;1.0;28.0;-677.8029069767441;"This is a really fun unit and I hate to do this but I'm going to return it because Segway's customer service just told me that if you have a flat tire you will void the warranty if you replace the tire (not that they sell spares anyhow). Folks replacing the tire does NOT involve removing the wheel assembly and is something that will be required on ANY product with air-filled tired, whether it be a bicycle, car or anything else. Imagine buying a bike and being told that replacing the tire yourself voids the warranty and that you have to return the entire unit to get a new tire. The unit doesn't even come with good tires, but some unknown name with no Slime or anything else to protect it. Replacement tires are available abroad, and they apparently sell quite a few of them, but I'm not going to mess around with paying high delivery charges, duties, language barriers etc.  I'll send this back and let Segway deal with it. If they ever learn to support this product maybe I'll reconsider.\n\nThis is a fun toy and is exactly as described, but I can't see this having any real use as a transportation device, for most people an electric bicycle would be a much better choice to go short distances to go to work or run errands. I've only used this for about 3 miles, so if I change my mind I'll update this. I weigh 170 and am 6'1"" so I'm within the specs.\n\nPros: Easy to learn to control, I don't see any problem with the controls being reversed when you're going backwards, that's the way everything else is. Getting off is quite easy, the only thing that is a bit hard is getting on since mine at least goes back when you first put on foot on it (even though I'm careful not to touch the control bar). I'm hoping that I'll get used to getting on quickly.\n\nI actually like the tutorial and appreciate the fact that it makes you use it a bit before unlocking the speed, I'm really not trying to kill myself. I've gotten it up to full speed (about 10.5 mph) and unlike many others I see why it's limited to this speed. If you were going uphill or downhill and you were going much faster the motors would not be able to compensate and you'd fall flat on your face. Even if there was a release that you had to click to allow you to overcome the speed limit it wouldn't keep Ninebot from being sued by the pedestrians you would hit.\n\nIt seems to be sturdy and well built, I guess time will tell.\n\nCons:\n\nMy unit came with the tires only inflated to about 26 psi. Hopefully everyone checks their tires and makes sure they're at 40-50 psi since underinflated tires will strain the motors.\n\nSpare parts may be an issue. I can't imagine that the tires won't have to be replaced fairly often and sending it back each time isn't an option. Something like Slime would fix a small leak but Ninebot needs to get its act together and have spares and other parts listed on their web site.\n\nThis thing is HEAVY. I'm in pretty good shape and I can lift it with no problem, but there's no way you could lift this for any distance on stairs, entering and leaving subways, etc. and getting it up four or flights of steps in a New York walk up would kill you.\n\nNinebot's instructions could be better. For example, when you charge it and all the 5 bars are lite it is not fully charged, you have to wait until the lights start flashing and the LED on the charged turns green (or in my case an orange color). That's not really intuitive so they should have been more detailed.\n\nAnyhow, for a toy it's fun and certainly different. Just hope it doesn't end up gathering dust. I've placed an order for a hand handlebar made specifically for the minipro being sold by a store in DC. When it comes in I'll give that a try and see if it makes this more useful (although by doing that it won't be able to stand on it's own when it's not being ridden anymore).";Fun Toy - but abysmal parts situation does not bode well for the future
120;31.0;4.0;28.0;-391.9312499999999;I have driven the international version of the Ninebot by Segway MiniPRO for over 800 miles and rode it in a city with lots of hills. The kind of hills that force regular cyclists to dismount and push their bikes on foot. First, this is an impressive piece of tech with strong electric motors in a compact, light design. Kudos to Segway for delivering excellent self-balancing technology on two wheels and Ninebot as well for doing a great job in bringing down the manufacturing costs. But my enthusiasm for the product has faded a little after 800 miles and it's mainly because of the lean-back function that kicks in when you go over the Segway's speed limit or reach maximum power output in certain bumpy conditions. The Segway will lean back when you are using too much electric power going uphill or downhill. This behavior is very dangerous to the rider because it will throw him/her off balance. Then there are the physical dimensions of the wheels that make it impossible to go up a curb that is one and a half inches above the pavement. Even a one-inch high curb can be a challenge. You will likely fall off the Segway in either scenario. The speed will drop significantly once you have 30% remaining in your battery pack. I can live with that. But if you ride over several bumps in a row, the Segway will cut down your speed assuming that you are doing dangerous maneuvers when that is not the case at all. This can be very frustrating if your route has potholes or bumpy surfaces. So I'm selling my Ninebot-Segway and getting the Ninebot E which has bigger wheels like a Segway SE but comes with an optional knee control stick like the one you see on the Segway miniPRO.\n\nJuly 9 2016 update:\n\nDue to major design flaws in the optional knee control stick on the Ninebot Elite PTR (450W) I recently bought, I have gone back to using my Ninebot-Segway miniPRO (int'l version), which I was planning to sell. Ninebot's recent 1.3.1 firmware update to the miniPRO has resolved the lean-back and speed control issues that I had in the last 2 months. Thank God. Those 2 months took away most of the joy of riding the miniPRO but Ninebot finally fixed it. My message to Ninebot is don't fix what's not broken. I had five splendid months of riding the Ninebot-Segway miniPRO that was followed with 2 frustrating months dealing with the maddening lean-back and speed cutting features that were incorporated in the May firmware update. It took the Ninebot guys 2 months to come around and see the light. I'm a happy trooper now. If only Ninebot could fix the badly-designed knee control stick for the Ninebot Elite PTR...;Four stars!

I know mine is not UL approved and does not have the warranty in U.S. (Like the Segway model). I bought it from eBay for $1200. And, after riding it endlessly, I can tell you there is no product better than this in the world. Once you ride it, you will never want to ride the cheap hoverboards ever again. It is amazing. You will not believe it. This is a Ferrari and outshines the hover boards on every level. It is a more affordable version of the $5000 Segways. It has remote control. You do not need to know how to self balance. Once you get on it, you will not get off. You can change the lights. You can go over grass, sand and puddles without any issues. It has air tires. It is smooth. The new firmware make it much safer to ride. Love it.";ANAZING IS AN UNDERSTATEMNT!

He has been disabled for many years now with Silicosis which is from sandblasting.  We would hike all kinds of paths and fishing holes; walking miles.  Since his silicosis we haven't been able to walk down to the beach front without him getting out of breath and wheelchairs are just not his thing.  Yesterday I opened the box and really was worried about the balance part of this device.  My father is not as stable as he used to be so I was a bit apprehensive as you should be when your parents get older.  But I also know that he hates the fact of being limited by his lungs.  Today began a new chapter in his life. We walked 1.8 miles around the lake on paths up an incline on a bridge and down the other side.  It was like he had been on it forever.  Of course I still would caution people who are going to encourage an elder person to try something new to know their limits.  My dad said it will take some getting used to, but today he felt relaxed and you could tell this is the beginning of a new chapter in his life (lets face it he's had it a day and a half).  He is still getting used to the knee controls but I just worked with him until I found a setting that felt right for his knee control.  We will continue to go for walks to improve his skills and confidence but at this point he is really happy with the freedom this new personal transportation device brings.  Ps. it would be great if Segway created a higher cane like stabilization so that older people could have a form of security to hang onto. But I also understand that, that is not the target audience for this device.  Maybe they should think about it a bit more though they could change the lives of many people by just giving them a new pair of legs.  I am thankful for this device.  I do suggest the use of a helmet with this device but each person has their own choice and I have to respect that.";Segway miniPRO beginning a new life...

But then one day, while riding in a smooth empty parking lot I was surprised by a sudden beep, beep, beep, and then a tilt back that was abrupt and unusual.  The Segway tilted me back farther than usual, and very suddenly, throwing me off balance and causing me to fall straight backward, landing on my head and back.  I wasn't wearing a helmet and my head struck the pavement hard, lacerating my scalp with a two inch gash exposing my skull.  My upper back vertebra also sustained trauma from the impact.  I went to the ER and got a head CT and back X-rays, and 7 staples to close the head wound. I missed a week of work following the accident.  I was barely able to get up from bed due to the severe back pain caused by the impact with the pavement.\n\nThis is a cautionary tale.  I haven't ridden my minipro since the accident several months ago.  I no longer trust it.it tilted me back so far so fast that I don't think it is predictable.  And I'd ridden it for a long time before this happened.  It was uncharacteristic and rare behavior.  But I think it may have been due to a software glitch.  I sent telemetry back to Segway.  They analyzed it and told me that basically it was my fault for leaning too far forward when exceeding the speed limit.  They said it tilted me back 7 degrees.  But my impression is that it ""threw me off"".\n\nI recommend riders use caution and avoid flirting with the top speed.  Expect that your minipro may suddenly tilt back to a degree never experienced before.  But if it happens to you, know that it is so sudden and uncontrollable that there's not much you can do to avoid an unbalanced backward fall.  So wear a helmet always...  I really liked riding my minipro but am not sure what to do with it now.  I realize now that I was lucky.  I could have died from the head injury.";Use caution, wear a helmet!
42;45.0;5.0;16.0;-607.503395149786;Absolutely love this product!  For me, it's been life-changing.  I am disabled and use a i2/x2 which also has a seat.  The big device is maneuverable, rock solid, and ideal for extremely crowded places.  The biggest drawback of the bigger unit is that getting it in and out of my car takes a lot of time.  This makes tasks requiring lots of driving & getting in and out of the car extra time consuming, and difficult.  I mean the big one has to be disassembled & 'craned' into my car where it takes a ton of room.  I'm also lucky that the 90% of the time I don't need to drive to get where I need to go, but it's still a problem with my i2/x2.\n\nAs far as this little guy is concerned, It deals with all the weaknesses of an i2/x2.  It's 26lbs, vs 100+ which means I can lift it with one hand!  It's also strong and supportive enough for me to use in stores and such.  The between-the-leg position of the control rod is MUCH easier and more responsive than the twist systems of a 'hover board', and even more stable than the handlebar setup over which It also offers a lot more control, stability & permits hands-free operation.  The lighting and Bluetooth control is AMAZING.  It's also REALLY cheap.\n\nIt does have some drawbacks compared to it's larger cousin: I've yet to figure out how to get a seat on it (and am not sure if that will work).  It's not  as solid as a big Segway.  It's small size makes it less stable than a big Segway.  Take care when going over large bumps, wet, or other low traction terrain , especially when these factors combine.  Also, those with large feet (like my size 15 boats) will have feet much larger than the platform, which means that others can hit them in rare cases.  As a result I often use my cane to provide extra support, which is rarely required with my i2/x2.\n\nI'd also like to see them add a few features. The app is amazing, but could use some improvements.  The English isn't very good at all.  For example, it says 'Close NineBot' instead of 'Turn off'.  The Bluetooth has some issues with the iPhone 7, which me deviceans I need to reboot my iPhone in a very limited set of circumstances.  The Android issue is even worse: It took a month after release for 7.0 support to work at all & it still won't work with 7.1.  While being to control the lighting patterns / colors and even turn them off is amazing, there are some issues:  you can't turn off the yellow turn indicator lights (but can turn the break lights off), the last two colors in the color switching feature are never used, and after too many changes, the lights stop responding, unless you restart.  Finally, the ability to lock the device is great, but incomplete:  It will just turn off after a few hours.  You still can't turn it off until it's unlocked, but the device will turn off entirely after 3 or 4hrs.  This saves power and the device will revert to locked mode if you power it back on, but this means that the alarm won't be set off someone tries to move it.\n\nFOR THE ABLE BODIED USER: Many of MY issues compared to i2/x2 are greatly reduced and won't be noticed if you aren't disabled or don't use an i2/x2 regularly.  In reality, the hands free operation will greatly outweigh the difference for most.  The Mini works far better than the ankle-twist control of a 'hover board'.  Every friend who has used mine LOVES it, especially 'hover board' users.  Segway has the benefit given by 15yrs of experience in the field.  It also has the engineering know-how to avoid electrical problems (catching on fire, etc.) and knows how to comply with safety regulations & other laws.  Finally, they have a of a national dealer network to offer service & support.;Amazing Product & Great for the Disabled
52;46.0;1.0;17.0;19.04000000000002;I tried it, and returned it. Overall, it seemed pretty cool, but get on it and hit what seems like an average speed and the thing starts slowing down by leaning you backwards. As you compensate for it, it stops and you fly off. After about ten times of trying to compensate for it, I packed it back in the box and shipped it back. If you could override the way it slows you down, it might be a winner... But not in this iteration.;Need a helmet when you get tossed off, and a cup to protect what else gets hit as you fly forward...
63;47.0;2.0;17.0;-724.0021297429619;"Pardon the saga, but I think it is important for you to know what a simple flat tire (that came from the company) will entail. This is an example of the flawed design with the tire that requires the unit to be sent back. We will all  get a flat tire at some point, and the repair process is far from convenient and will take over 2 weeks from start to finish to complete.\n\nMy experience:\n\nThe unit that was delivered to me had both tires under inflated at 14 PSI. I attempted to fill them both and one tire took air to 38 PSI and the other tire went completely flat (45 PSI is in the manual and the technician said it should leave the manufacturer with) . I went online and filled out a Contact Us link. The email response that was sent to me directed me to the wrong Segway department. That department was unable to provide me with the proper contact information. I Googled more info and reached a woman, Sallie, who stated that I needed to call someone else and gave me that number. I called that number and spoke to a gentleman, John, who I had to explain my story to again and then he sent me a Word Document via email that I had to fill out and attach back to the mail as well as take a picture of the serial number on the unit and attach that picture to the email (the serial # was already a required field on the Word document). After I sent the Word document back, I received an email stating that I was to call another number to setup a return of the unit. {the wheels have a motor in them, so you cannot just replace a tire or an inner tube; the entire unit must be returned to fix a flat tire} After calling the number given to me in my return email, I reached a lady who strangely enough was the same lady, Sallie, who sent me on this goose chase 2 days earlier. After I gave her the RMA number, she asked me if I wanted to fix it myself or send the entire unit back. I told her that I would be happy to fix it myself but the technician stated I would have to send the entire unit back. She said ""oh, OK"" and she would send me instructions on how to send it back and that I had to follow the instructions very carefully as FedEx would not accept it if I did not. I inquired if FedEx would pick up the unit and she stated I would need to pack it up and drive to a FedEx and drop it off there. When I explained that I had received a damaged unit and I felt it appropriate for them to have FedEx pick it up at my house to minimize the further inconvenience, Sallie said that I could see if FedEx would come to my house and that I could pay for them to if they did. I told her that the service i had received so far was horrible and that if Segway would not accommodate having FedEx pick up at my house, I would just return the unit for a refund to Amazon and cut my loss; Sallie simply stated ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" That's it. ""No ""let me see what I can do"", No ""I'm sorry for the inconvenience this has caused you."" Nothing. Sallie could not have cared less whether I was a satisfied customer or not. I'm sorry for Segway that she is their customer facing agent.\n\nSo,\n1. Service request via the Web Contact Us link,\n2. Return email saying I contacted the wrong department\n3. Phone call to the number given to me\n4. Reached the ""incorrect"" department (apparently), who gave me new phone number\n5.  Called technician,\n6. Technician sends an email that requires to be filled out and reattached (you will need to print, fill, and scan back in if you don;t have Word installed),\n7. Fill out form and had to take a picture of Serial number sticker on unit although the form requires that info already\n8. Emailed that form back\n9. Recieved an email telling me to call a different number\n10.  Called that number. Said she wants to speak with the technician\n11. Process ended when Sallie was unwilling to provide basic customer service\n12. Returned the unit to Amazon (the EASIEST part of this process. Thank you Amazon)\n\nBecause you WILL get a flat tire at some point during the product life, buyer beware. I hope that sharing my horrible customer service experience will save you the same type of hassle. Save your money; it's going to have to go back anyways,";Do not buy until you read this!

116;48.0;5.0;17.0;-71.56210526315785;"i've been on Segways all over the world on 'city tours' and demos since they were introduced to the general public.  The Segway miniPro is a fantastic and fun transport/platform.  Great design, intuitive and loaded with a lot of great features.  Incredibly solid and sturdy as well; extremely portable too!  The only complaint is that 10mph top speed is a bit of a downer for us experienced riders and based upon the systems ability to monitor my riding style/behavior i think it would be cool if i could 'earn' more speed as i demonstrate proficiency.  I would gladly trade a few miles of battery for extra speed (fix that in a firmware upgrade please).  i recognize that there is a point where safety (read ""liability"") factors into Segway's thinking, but i'd gladly indemnify the company for a higher top end speed!  Great job, great product, great fun!!!!";Don't wait!  Get yours now, you will not regret it!
121;49.0;5.0;17.0;-178.5828571428571;I got my Segway Minipro a couple of days ago and Ive been playing with it everyday. Let me tell you this thing is nothing short of Amazing!  It is so well done and it has couple of things that separate it from all other hoverboards BUT! the most impressive thing besides how it rides is the App. The App is brilliantly and intelligently done, from when you first start to use it you can tell that Segway had safe in mind. The App has a tutorial that you have to go through and then ride for about 0.6 miles before it unlocks higher speeds. Im really impressed with the fact that Segway did this so people will have to learn to ride it a little before they just jump on it and crash into something at 10mph. Also with the App once you unlock the top speed you can still set a limit so if your letting someone new use it so they cant go the max speed. The app has a ton of other features... you can change the colors of the rear lights, you can remote control the Segway around, it tells you all sorts of information about your Segway, Like how fast you're going, how much father you can go before the battery dies. It even has a feature that allows you to connect with other Segway Riders its their version of social media. Now just as impressive as the App is how it rides My GOD its smooth! its easy and its really fun. I has no problem learning to ride it. I cannot recommend this enough Im really happy with my Segway.;Amazing Ride!!! Whole new experience!!
43;50.0;3.0;15.0;-1256.3338369483918;"Very mixed experience here. I rode a friend's one time and so much fun that I simply had to buy one. I did a lot of research first and I found most of the reviews to be fairly accurate compared to my experience, in both the positive and negative aspects so I'll go over a few of the more important ones on both sides.\n\nInitial impression was that it seems to be a case of mostly great engineering/design (a few clear exceptions noted below) with serious concerns about poor quality control and/or manufacturing processes. It's brilliant in many ways: it is as smooth as riding on a cloud and the controls are intuitive and easy enough that I felt extremely fluid and graceful after only a little practice.  On the other hand, it feels cheap and fragile in many ways.\n\nThe wheels and wheel covers feel cheaply made and too reliant on flimsy plastic giving it an air of fragility.\n\nThe part where the steering knee bar attaches to the base is not very securely fastened and the friend's that I had rode to test it out was already broken in that spot so that it kept falling out and it made me a little wary to begin with before I'd even decided to place my order.\n\nThe height adjustment for the knee bar is secured by a simple screw that could easily get worn out or stripped and become worthless if you are not gentle with it (DO NOT pick it up at the top by the knee bars, pick it up from the base or this will likely happen quickly).\n\nThose orange and grey screw covers that look like spokes also just pop right off very easily if you hit a bump. There is nothing to really make them secure, they just snap into place and the plastic is a little flexible so they definitely will pop out sooner or later unless you keep it under 2 mph and never go over a bump. Most of the time I noticed when they fell off and I could go back for them, but I still lost two in my wake on the first day (the grey one was a hopeless search after dusk), burning through the supply of replacements in a matter of hours.\n\nI started to notice that it was odd that they were mostly popping off one side. After riding for a while longer I also began to notice that it seemed a little uneven in the way it rode over bumps, which I don't think I could have notice until I started to get really comfortable on it. Well I put 2+2 together and I inspected the tires and sure enough one was flat!  Yes, after just my initial tutorial phase and within my first couple miles of riding on paved streets I had already gotten a flat!  I'm not sure if it was even under pressure out of the box because I didn't think to check the tire pressure before riding it.  I had decided to take it out for a long ride to ""break it in"" so I was about a mile from my house when I discovered the flat. Fortunately the tires have pretty rigid sidewalls and I could have been riding for a while before I noticed the flat and it didn't seem dramatically worse on that side.\n\nNot wanting to mess it up any worse, I walked it home after I discovered the flat. Which I also discovered to be a total weak point and another design flaw. The pull-out handle is nice, but is too short so if you are pulling it behind like a typical rolling carrier bag your heels will get clipped repeatedly unless you hold it far out to your side which is of course awkward and makes it hard to control.\n\nOn something of a side note, the app seems to be a massive battery killer (bluetooth the main culprit I guess), my phone battery went dead faster from monitoring the speed than the miniPro did carrying my 200 lb frame around.  It also seemed a bit rough (a few bad instances of engrish in the menus), like a hastily developed translation/adaptation of the original ninebot app, and it deserves a facelift/update.\n\nThe speed limiter is a reasonable and understandable safety ""feature"" to have, but it is extremely annoying and I don't think it is well implemented and actually creates more danger than it prevents due to this. Instead of simply limiting your top speed, it actually tilts itself backward when  you exceed the speed limit, and this has been the only thing that has caused me to fall off. I was riding at top speed and about to make a turn when it kicked in and leaned back, pulling the knee bar out from between my knees so I couldn't really steer at the crucial moment I needed to in order to negotiate the turn smoothly. I had to quickly lean back and try to steer and knocked the knee bar causing it to go into a clumsy speed wobble that sent me off and to the ground (pro-tip: if you think you might crash, just hop off. don't try to ride it out or try to step off and back on like a skateboard because it will probably go a bit wonky if you shift your weight on and off like that. It will balance itself so unless it heading straight into an obstacle it will just harmlessly roll to a stop remaining upright). I wasn't injured or anything, but it wouldn't have happened without that speed limiter function. Hopefully future firmware updates will address this and improve the implementation. Preferably they would just let us override this feature, I'll sign a waiver and/or void my warranty by loading cracked firmware if that is what it will take. It really should be optional, or at least let us set disable the way it leans back and slows you down, I'd settle for a simple top speed hard line if you could just hold that speed without fighting it back and forth. As it is the best thing to do is try to get very close to the limit and hold a steady pace right there to avoid it kicking in, but that is tricky (especially up and down hills of any size) and requires concentration as well. It would be better if you could simply hit max speed and just be in cruise control mode at a steady rate.\n\nRiding it around in public will definitely draw lots of attention which is a combination of added fun (you will leave a broad swath of smiles in your wake) and also obviously a bit of annoyance since it can be a distraction and not everyone is making friendly comments. On the positive side, I rode up to a store and the cute girl at the door of store greeted me with a smile and said, ""Well hello, Man From The Future!"" but you also get a lot of weird stares and asinine comments about making sure that you don't blow yourself up or catch on fire when the battery explodes. I'm already really tired of explaining that it is not the same thing as the hoverboards that have had those problems.\n\nSo while I remain heavily skeptical about the durability and reliability of these, I still really think it is a great product that I want in my life, so I've sent mine back and once the refund is processed I will give it another shot and I will update my review accordinglyif everything goes ok with the process and the new one is ok then I'll definitely need to up this to a 4-star.";Flawed genius: fun and amazing until I had a flat tire, never even had a chance to drain the battery once
7;51.0;5.0;8.0;-980.7604850746268;This is a long and complete review - If you read no further know this, this thing is really great.  Well made, good performance and a TON of FUN.  Will it replace my car as a main mode of transportation?  Of course not.  Its just a fun vehicle to ride around on.  Its very quiet and makes for a peaceful ride.  Especially with the knee controller and having my upper body completely free, its like magically gliding around effortlessly.\n\nI ride it in my neighborhood and on local bike trails that go through the woods.  MN Law gives the MiniPro the same rights as an electric wheelchair meaning I can ride on bike trails and pedestrian trails.  Its so quiet Ive surprised some wildlife and have been able to get back into the woods of my local parks I would not have been able to do otherwise with my bad knee.  Im over 50 and will need knee replacement at some point.  With this device, I can get outside without having extreme pain after a couple of miles of walking.  Ive owned this for 4 months.  I resisted the temptation to review it right away  wanted to use it for a reasonable amount of time before submitting a review.\n\nHere are some specifics Ive seen others address Ill give my 2 cents.\n\nControl.  With the stick the control is effortless.  I don't even think about the stick, its just lean and go.  Im a 6 tall fat guy so I prefer to keep the stick height at the lowest level and it contacts my legs just below the knee.  You can adjust as needed.  When at home I store it near the rear of my garage so I have to slalom around bikes and stuff to get it to the charger.  It responds like a dream.\n\nSpeed:  After a very short training period the speed limit is set to 10.6 MPH.  I have not found this to be a problem but I admit, every once in a while it beeps at me and leans me back as I exceed this limit.  This is usually on long straight flat areas where you feel really comfortable thus you tend to want to go faster.  You get used to the limit after a while and its not a big deal.  But if speed is important to you, you might be disappointed that you cant go faster than 10MPH.  (see handlebar topic below for more)  If you think about it, gliding at 10MPH means you're one big bump away from falling to the pavement at 10MPH.  Better than falling at 15MPH.  But certainly I would love to be able to disable the speed warning beeper. (And if they imcreased the limit to 12-15 MPH, Id love it for street riding.\n\nHandlebars:  The unit comes with a knee controller for turning control.  Unlike a hoverboard that uses the differential angle between the left and right foot pads for steering, the Segway has a one-piece platform and steering direction is done with the control stick.  You usually don't have to think about it.  As you lean into a turn, the stick is nudged my your legs/knee and turns the Segway for you.  You can get optional handlebars from third party sellers.  This makes the MiniPro act just like a Segway PT.  I bought this thinking I would always use it with my bad knee.  But it was not the case.  First, having the handlebar installed DOES make the Segway stable and easy.  Too stable and easy.  So stable and easy that you want to go faster and are constantly hitting the 10MPH speed limit.  Second, its not as fun.  Using the knee control is a bit more challenging.  So while I bought the handlebar kit, I only use it if a guest wants to try my Segway.\n\nStorage.  I prefer to store it in a heavy duty storage tote.  I place a carpet remnant that forms a U in the tote allowing for three sides of protection, minimal rolling around in the trunk and when I store it, people cannot see whats in the tote.\n\nThe App.  The app is good for setup, light settings and looking at battery life and speed.  But other than that, not super useful.  I really don't care what other riders near me are doing.  But the app works fine and I can connect my Bluetooth earpiece and the BT app at the same time.\n\nBattery:  So far battery life is great.  The App gives you a live view into battery performance.  The unit is advertised to give 14mi per charge.  Ive never drained the battery, but based on a simple calculation of having less than 50% battery after a 6 mile ride, I would likely not get 14 miles but then again, I am over the 220lb weight limit so the Segway is clearly working harder when I ride.\n\nCrashes:  I have ridden full size Segways many times. Including a recent ride for a work outing.  Have to say, after riding the MiniPro, riding a regular Segway is pretty boring.  But there are some things to keep in mind.  The MiniPro has much smaller wheels so you cannot to over large bumps, large cracks in the pavement  or wide expansion joints.  The ONLY crash I ever had in 4 months was on Day 2 trying to go over a big crack in the sidewalk.  I have had NEAR-CRASHES.  This happens when going down a steep incline too fast.  For some reason my balance goes backwards and I lean in the wrong direction.  Luckily in these cases I was able to hop off the MiniPro and it glided to a stop and I was on my way.\n\nNight gliding.  Some people commented on why anyone would glide at night.  Except for the occasional bug slapping me in the face, night gliding is great.  I do it in remote areas where I can look at the lake with just the headlights lighting the way.  The low-angle of the light does a very good job of lighting the way.  Really fun.\n\nSo in summary its just plain FUN.  I live in MN and will only get to ride this 6 months a year. Still worth it for me.  If you can afford it  take the leap.  Youll love it!;Fun, Well made. Treat yourself.
64;52.0;4.0;16.0;-5.316799999999972;This thing rocks.  Bought one for my wife and I.  We go out every day and just cruise around the neighborhoods.  10MPH feels fast at first, but once you acclimate you wish for more.  I think 13 MPH would be perfect.  I realize it's a limitation of the motors etc.  I'm 6'3 and 205lbs and it works well - my wife is only 100lb and there are time where she has an easier time making it up inclines, or going through grass.  She also gets about 2 more miles of range out of it due to weight.  Still plenty of juice for a nice ride.\n\nIf you're on the fence, just do it.  It's frivolous, but wow is it fun.;Just get it.
19;53.0;1.0;13.0;30.76807692307695;Returned item. Glorified toy-Segway in name only. Top speed of 3 mph unless you follow very restrictive registration policy. I would strongly advise researching before buying.;Use is too controlled by restrictive company policy.
68;54.0;5.0;16.0;-809.0032965821388;I always wanted to get a hover-board but never got around to buying one. When I saw this on Prime day I wanted to get it but did not until two days later. Should have got it on sale but none the less I ordered it and it came rightly on time.\n\nIt came very well packaged and with a full charged. It was pretty much fully assembled except for the knee bar which went on in a jiffy and was very easily adjusted to my desired hight. Turned it on and it is amazing the self balancing and how it just holds itself up. I was able to connect it quickly to the app and customize the lights and go through the training which had me getting on the Segway, turning in each direction, moving and turning and then lifting it to avoid obstacles. Once done I was free to ride but at a restricted speed of around 6 miles per hour. I was restricted to that speed for .6 miles until it unlocked the full speed of 10 miles per hour.\n\nOn the note of a 10 mile per hour max speed I have seen many reviews complaining that that speed isn't nearly as fast enough. Well I can say the same thing that it seems that it should be able to go faster than just 10 miles per hour. But having ridden it now for over 30 miles I am very comfortable with that speed and don't feel any faster would be much of benefit, especially looking at how it works. As you lean forward it starts to speed up to shift the center of gravity back to keep you balanced. The further you lean the faster it goes to keep you up. Now another one of the main complaints that I have heard is that when you hit the max speed the unit beeps, if you have the app open, you phone vibrates and then the Segway automatically slows you down. They complain that this can cause you to fall off the Segway. That is totally true. At first I did not like it and I wanted it to just let me go top speed and even faster, until I fell off.\n\nAfter having the Segway for a couple days and feeling very confident my Wife and I went to the Park at night to ride around the track. We were doing laps when we were getting back to the car I wanted to go fast. I started out quick and it started to beep and try to slow me down but for some dumb reason of my own I thought it was notifying me for accelerating too quickly. I got going very fast to the point that I lost balance and fell.\n\nAs a result of the fall I hyperextended my wrist and got scratches all across my back from sliding on the pavement. Luckily I didn't break my wrist and the scratches were miner that were gone a few days later. As for the falls effect on the Segway, absolutely nothing. We looked it all over and there was not so much as a scratch. As soon as I fell off it balanced itself out and kind of veered off into the grass, because my leg hit the steering bar as I fell off and stopped a few feet away. It was amazing that it caught itself and didn't have any damage whatsoever. This is really a great product, but back to the fall.\n\nThe fall was completely my fault and it taught me to love the beep and the forced slow down. Now I don't know if they can make the Segway max out on speed but my thought is they cannot, It needs to be able to speed up to pull back your center of gravity to balance you as you lean and if it maxed at 10 and didn't go faster it wouldn't be able to catch you. As I was falling the Segway was going about 13 mph as it tried to catch me but my lean became too much and it wasn't able to go any faster to catch me so I just fell. Even thought I fell I have still been riding and now I have a lot more experience I don't hit the beep or slow down as often because I have gotten used to riding just under the max speed so it doesn't need to correct.\n\nThis is such a fun ride that my wife and I take turns. The only negative is price so we only have the one for now but hopefully down the road we can get a second because this is totally worth the cost. I would recommend anyone this Segway and advise to only listen to the beeps because they help you so you know when to start leaning back so when it slows you down you aren't dumb like myself and actually slow down instead of falling and hyperextending your wrist like I did.  Now stop reading this and get up there and buy this thing so it gets to you soon and you can have as much fun and people staring at you as you ride around or even better as you remote control it around with the app.;This is AWESOME! But be aware of one feature and potential user injury.
94;55.0;5.0;16.0;-459.9814847942755;This product is one of the few things in my life that impacts the way i function in real life. Ive been a huge fan of ninebots since the mini first came out in China in November '15. I was one of the first people to be cruising around in Shenzhen on them and also one of the first in San Francisco. Ive put about 3000 miles total between the ninebot mini and the ninebot elite in the last 7 months.\n\nIve come across a lot of questions and comments in that time and ill address them in the order of frequency:\n- How far can it go? Ive gone up to 15 miles on a single charge, but given the terrain and aggressive acceleration i get around 10 miles.\n- How long does it take to recharge? Its a 250W battery with a 120W charger, so about 2 hours.\n- How fast can it go? 10MPH is about right, but it does begin to throttle you when the battery is <20%.\n- Is it easy to ride? Hell yes, its ridiculously easy to ride. Ive let kids to parents ride them with no problem in just a few minutes. Only 1 person had legs so shaky that i was concerned.\n- Can you go up hills? Yup. Even the steepest hills SF has to offer.\n- What do you think about hoverboards? Hoverboards are fun and more agile in indoor smooth surface environments, but as soon as you take them outdoors they become impractical.\n- How does it do over bumps? It crushes them.\n- Do you work for ninebot? No.\n- What do you do when the battery dies? Well, im a person too. I have a smartphone with uber. I can easily pop this little baby in the trunk if i need to. I generally take the charger with me in my bag and charge it at home and by my desk so i rarely run out of juice.\n-Can you go down curbs? Yes. Stairs? Yes, but... im a little crazy.\n-Can you go up stairs and curbs? No. Fortunately SF and Shenzhen have tons of sidewalk cutouts which allow me to cruise without stepping off often. My office is 5 miles away (Outer richmond to SOMA for those familiar with SF) and i don't step off once.\n-Have you ever hurt yourself? Yes, its all part of the learning process.\n-You're lazy, why don't you use your legs? This one is probably the question that irritates me the most. This is not for the lazy --its like skiing down a bunny slope. Im actually in better shape since ive started riding.\n\nNow to comment on things that people don't think about.\n-I have about 16x more things to do and places to eat. Before, i was willing to walk up to a quarter mile to find a place to eat. Now im willing to go up to a mile and hills are not a factor. A =   r2.\n-My commute time is no longer affected by traffic or public transportation frequency/times. I have a pretty fixed commute time.\n-The childhood explorer has returned. Ive taken every cross street in a 5x2 mile block in SF by varying my commute [for fun].\n\nEDIT: The american charger has 120W.;The Segway Mini is my favorite product since the digital camera
122;56.0;5.0;16.0;-174.99499999999998;Got my miniPRO last night and toured the hallways of my apartment building for a little while on it.  Tonight we had great weather and I took it down and around the National Mall.  I've wanted a Segway PT (the bigger guys with the handlebar controls) since they first came out, but the price has been prohibitive for what would (for me) be more a toy than an everyday transportation device.  I've ridden them quite a bit on various tours, though.\n\nThis is the next best thing.  It's fast, easy to control, smooth-riding, and powerful enough to provide confidence in going over bumps and uneven pavement.  The construction feels solid.  The battery range is great.  And most of all it's just ridiculously fun.  I have to imagine this is what being able to levitate by telekinesis would be like: after being on it for ten or fifteen minutes or so and getting up the easy learning curve for the controls, it feels like you move just by thinking.\n\nThe app is a little clunky, in part because I think it's trying to do too much.  The current version has some fairly adventurous spelling and phrasing.  And it's kind of a shame they had to offload so much functionality into a smartphone app instead of putting the controls right on the device.  For me, those are all pretty minor quibbles in what's otherwise a top-notch product, but your mileage may vary.\n\nIn sum, though, if you're looking for a Segway-like experience without breaking the bank TOO much, this is a great machine.;100% fun.

31;58.0;5.0;13.0;-147.86999999999998;Ok...  this is my follow-up after three weeks on my mini pro.\n\nThe good news is I fell only once (hurt my pride more then my body).  I am now into my 2 week of using it.  I drove it out to San Diego to use on Coronado Island.  I have cruised the bay and drove around the island several times now and am having a blast.  It is a lot of fun.  The problem is, everyone asks me if it is a hover board.  They don't believe it is a Segway.  The battery has never worn down and have several miles on it.  My 250 lbs does not seem to be a problem.  My feet are sore after using it from the continual balancing on it.  The calf mussels and feet need the expercise!  Strongly recommend this thing for lots of fun.\n\nJust got my Segway yesterday.  Opened it up and charged it.  Lots of fun and works great.  I must admit I exceed the weight and age limit!!!  66 years old and 250 lbs.  does not seem to be an issue.  I got on right away and was cruising down the street within 30 minutes.  It says it has over a 15 mile range but my weight probably limits it.  I plan on taking it to San Diego to ride on the board walk.  So far so good.  My wife and son also rode with no issues.  Unfortunately I may be required to buy two...  my wife wants one also!;Too much fun.  I exceed weight and age but works great.
47;59.0;3.0;14.0;-201.85305084745755;Update: 11/7/16: After many months of downtime, I was finally able to call and order a charger. An agent had offered to put me on the list to contact once they became available, but I never heard back. The charger was 80.00 plus 10.00 to ship, so expect 90 dollars to replace or add if wanted. I was disappointed to see that the replacement did not have the section that goes from the power brick to the wall outlet. Luckily this three prong plug is found often, including in retired electronics I have put away. But for the price I feel it should have been included.\n\nAs a note the agent did tell me tires were available now too, but the process to replace wasn't easy. I didn't ask for more details.\n\nI have updated to three stars, as it really is a good product so far. But customer support, specifically for parts was pretty bad.\n\nOriginal review:\nI really liked this Segway. Unfortunately I cannot give a good review at this time. My charger was destroyed by a bored dog of mine. Segway does not offer replacements online, and after calling customer service I found out they DO NOT offer them at all. So I cannot charge my device and it is an expensive, useless purchase. After reading other reviews it seems this is their policy on replacement tires. None available. So people are left with a scooter that has flat tires. I'm sorry but this is just terrible product planning/development.\n\nThere are plenty of chargers and tires to sell with new scooters, but don't expect product support once you have paid for one. I think this policy speaks for itself.;Good scooter, questionable customer support.
87;60.0;1.0;15.0;-6.336999999999975;Wow what a disappointment for my family. I've been excited when we heard a Segway Mini was being released in the US. We ordered it on Prine Day extremely happy with the $699 price tag. Unfortunately, that was our highlight of this buying experience. We received the Segway a few days later on a Saturday and it didn't move forward or backward. I tried calling Segway customer care and after 4 days of a run around with a John and Jake all they could do is have a repair option in Michigan. Unacceptable now it's getting returned.;Barely 6 days of having this Segway it didn't move forward or backwards. Stay clear of this product and customer support.
95;61.0;5.0;15.0;-460.48833333333323;"**Update To Review**\nI realize it is not normal protocol to place an update to a previous review before the original review, but I simply wanted to make sure owners and potential owners read this portion.  Needless to say, my experience began with a less than satisfactory experience.  However, like anything mechanical, there is the possibility for something to go wrong.  That is why even the most reliable products ever manufactured have service departments.  In my view as a business owner, it is how a company reacts when the rare and unexpected problem occurs.  I can now say, fortunately, in my experience Segway is concerned with the quality of their products as well as the satisfaction of their customers.  It seems just my luck that I received that 'bad egg' in the bunch.  My Segway miniPRO completely failed the 3rd day I owned it.  However, based on the thousands of reviews, videos and comments about the product, I feel comfortable saying what I experienced was certainly the exception rather than the rule.\n\nPerhaps the most important part, for me anyway, was how Segway reacted after one of their products failed.  I have now received several phone calls and Segway is promptly replacing the unit.  Further, I understand that each Segway has something similar to a 'black box' in an airplane that allows Segway to determine exactly what went wrong.  I am clearly very willing to assure that Segway receives the unit that failed and, if necessary, make any correction to assure nobody else experiences what I did.  My faith in Segway is strong and I also believe this particular Segway fits a useful niche.  I apologize for the lengthy review along with a lengthy update, but it is my goal when reviewing a product to provide the most accurate and complete overview of the product as possible.  The product itself is very useful and the company cares about their customers and their reputation.  Hopefully the unedited initial review along with the update is not too confusing and provides a unique overview of how a good company responds when a product they produced does not function as it was designed to function.\n*****\n\nDay one was great. I went through all of the required training and enjoyed practicing on my 1/4 mile concrete driveway. Day two was fantastic. I bought this because of a medical reason I can no longer jog without great pain. I went along with my wife and dog on their 3 mile jog. Great!  Day three, DISASTER!!!! I went with my wife for her jog again and right when the temperature was perfect, asphalt was super smooth, at 6.2 mph both wheels locked up and this thing pitched me on my face!! It is completely dead (and was fully charged about 200 yards ago) and it does NOTHING. I spent a fair amount of money to get injured due to a defective product!!  If I could, I would give this thing zero stars. AVOID!\n\nAs you can see, this thing is only a couple days old and you are looking at all it can do; nothing. For obvious reasons I'm not posting pictures of my skinned up hands and torn pants.";Great machine.  Just be sure to follow training as written and then be careful for the first several miles.
41;62.0;5.0;13.0;-324.86564705882347;Got my first one on Prime Day - July 2016.  Bought it to alleviate wear and tear on my arthritic knees.  I was not disappointed.\nNeeded to buy another one for another city I travel to because you can't take these on commercial airline flights.\n  (There is no good reason that these should be banned since they are UL Labs approved for fire safety - but rules are rules.)\n---\n\nSAFETY RULES THAT AREN'T IN THE MANUAL:\n\nMake sure to review all the safety videos and instructions that Ninebot provides.\nHere are some additional rules that can save you from disaster that they don't mention or don't emphasise enough:\n\n1) When the Segway beeps, it is trying to tell you something.  Don't ignore it.\n\n2) The Segway can be moving and you might not feel it because it moves so smoothly.\n (Perhaps that is how a former owner of the company fell over a cliff on his Segway.)\n\n  a) When staying in one spot, don't be tempted to think that you can maintain from moving even when you are distracted, especially in a dark location when you have less reference points. Don't let yourself close your eyes while staying in one spot, because you won't even feel that it is moving and it will move!\n\n  b) Don't stare at your cellphone while using and staying in one place for the same reason.\n\n3. Avoid staying in one spot when you are right next to a street curb or high threshold, etc., because if you bump into it while you are trying to stay in place will confuse the on board guidance computer and it can become unstable and fall over.\n\n4. If you experience a very strong tail wind and you are not positioned sufficiently back on the platform, the wind can push you forward and cause you to suddenly accelerate.  When I suspect a strong tail wind I try to keep at least on foot more to the rear of the platform.\n\n5. Slow down when pedestrians or other potential obstacles can jump in front of you and keep at least one foot further back so that you can stop more quickly if needed. These can stop very quickly if you are not going very fast and are prepared to stop.\n\n6. Small puddles on concrete, no problem.  On polished stone like marble, don't even think about it.\n\nMore to come,;Very Safe, if you follow Segway's rules plus these.
18;63.0;5.0;11.0;-970.6712711864405;"I just wanted to share my thoughts so far, mostly because the reviews were very important to me in deciding to buy, and I might be able to help others here to know how to deal with some of the minor problems they are having!\n  I would have to say, I absolutely love this thing so far, and doing a couple small things have helped to improve my everyday experience dramatically! To those who have said that the their device consistently leans back as they are riding in normal conditions, I have also noticed that after a number of uses, it seems like the sensor becomes slightly out of calibration and it does lean back a little more even though the conditions haven't changed... Well guess what? It does have sensors, and just like all sensors, they need to be calibrated from time to time! And before you get worried, let me point out that the app that is provided allows you to ""very easily"" reset the calibration! Simply go to ""settings""- ""sensor settings""- and ""calibrate balance sensor""... Now it shows a prompt, ""Vehicle must be locked before calibration. Enable lock mode now?"" - I recommend having it standing still on flat, stable ground so that when you enable lock mode it doesn't fall over- then press ""Ok"" Follow the final prompt and press ""Ok"" again- (Now it says keep the device standing up during the calibration... If you have it standing still on solid flat ground then it will remain standing on it's own through the entire process, no need to touch it while it does it's thing!) and after a series of beeps (takes less than 3 seconds) you are all set! I do this, and my Segway once again leans forward with me just the way it did when I first bought it! So far it has worked every time!\n  On the same note with the balance sensor... The more you push it past the speed limiter, the more it will lean back and make it difficult to push the limits! I don't always use the app, as I'm guessing you might not either, but it isn't such a bad idea to pull it out every now and then and watch your speed on the app, to refresh your feel for what you can do, so that you don't always push it's limits! Also, I know it can make your feet a bit sore when first getting used to riding for great distances, but if you don't use your feet primarily for leaning the device forward then it can feel like the steering mechanism is positioned too far back. Example: Try leaning the device forward with your feet and body, using mostly your feet, instead of leaning your body forward and not so much your feet! Once again, an occasional reset of the calibration improves this!\n  Last but not least, the tires! Quite a few people seem to have a tough time with the tires staying aired up.. I had my first (and last, at least so far) flat tire within 3 days of pulling it out of the box! This doesn't mean you will have trouble right away, but you should understand that it is quite similar to a tubeless bicycle tire-  you have air pressure, (Apr: 30 PSI) as well as a medium thickness in rubber. A simple sticker bur does have the ability to pop your tire! That's what did it to mine! I live where there are tons of sticker burs, so I thought to myself that there wasn't a chance in hell I would be patching my tires several times a week, so I bought Slime! I got the kind intended for tubeless tires, because it can seal off fairly large holes.. I put about 4 oz. in each tire. Then I aired both tires back up to aprox. 30 PSI, and I haven't had any issues since! The way I see it, If it is something you can patch, Slime will plug it.. And if Slime can't fix it, you need a new tire anyway! So if you are going to replace the tire then go ahead and cut it to drain the excess slime so you don't make a mess when replacing the tire! I haven't replaced a tire, but I only say that because some might argue that Slime will make a mess of everything... No it won't! You don't need to pull the tire off unless it is ruined anyway, in which case- cut it, drain it, and put a new tire on! So far, 4 oz of slime has been plenty, and it has absolutely no affect on balance and maneuverability. You can always start with little, and add a little more later! Adding air can be a little bit tricky if your air chuck is bulky, because you will have to use the extension that is included..\n\nPROS:\n  -Durable (Over-all, the whole unit feels a lot more rugged than I would have expected)\n  -Fast and powerful!\n  -Portable! Very easy to haul around considering what it's capable of!\nCONS:\n  -The steering mechanism makes a lot of ""squeaky plastic"" noise\n  -The plastic cover for the charge port is probably the cheapest part on the device.. The spring barely can hold it closed, and it rattles all the  time! I only bring it up because of how well built the rest of the device is, and minus the one squeaky part and the one rattling part, it is virtually silent!\n  -The charger port: Where the charger cord plugs into the device feels very loose and doesn't snap in place. Just feels like a poor connection that could be improved!\n  -The air hose extension: It can be tricky to use the extension hose, because as long as it is connected to the valve stem, it wants to drain the tire! So you have to be a little bit tricky if using it to add air (getting it off without draining your tire) *Some hand pumps have a small enough chuck to fit directly onto the valve stem... mine does not!\n\nI hope this helps!\n\nWould I recommend this? Yes!";Completely 100% awesome! No problems that I haven't easily overcome! Segway miniPRO!

I think most people can get reasonably comfortable for simple operation in 15 minutes to an hour on flat, smooth surfaces. Mount with an assistant the first time and don't let the initial unsteadiness deter you - - it will pass as your brain adapts. I decided to give a full month before considering getting aftermarket handles if things didn't work out, and I'm glad I waited. After 2 weeks it started to feel natural on most surfaces and inclines. After a month it began to be second nature. Now, after almost 3 months and probably close to 300 miles (haven't connected to Bluetooth for a while) and almost daily use (thanks to a kind California climate) my body adjusts instinctively to minor bumps and mild lateral inclines so I can concentrate on the journey and not the technique. It's become relaxing and addictive. If you're looking for high speed thrills go with something else. If you like the sensation of a vehicle that's very responsive and becomes an extension of your body that is remarkably maneuverable, this is your baby, And you can always add the handles later if you need to.\nP. S. Don't forget to exercise 'cause you're not going to get aerobic training out of this, although it will help strengthen your core and some of the leg muscles associated with stability.\n********SIX MONTH UPDATE********\nOver 500 miles with almost daily use and no glitches or flats to date (knock on wood). Purchased an aftermarket handlebar from More4Mini-Handlebar-Segway-MiniPRO-Black which is well made and easily swapped out for the knee control bar, mainly to introduce the machine to new riders, as it does make the learning curve even shorter. Only had a chance to let one curious soul try it so far and it does a good job. It will be a great addition when my balance starts to fade under the inexorable weight of time; for now I prefer the hands-free experience.\n\nI make sure to top off the tires every 2-3 weeks (easiest without the extension tube that drains the tire), using a battery powered tire air compressor that has a dial-in pressure setting.\n\nStill love the unit and hope an affordable robot upgrade is released this year to allow it to follow you when you dismount.\n**13-MONTH UPDATE**\n1st flat 886 miles with air leak unresponsive to Slime. Turns out about a 5 inch section of the middle of the tread area had thinned to the point that there was a small fissure, and a bulge in the area was evident with tire inflation. Since this was likely due to stress from chronic overinflation (Ninebot's recommendation 45 pounds, tire wall lists 30# max) I was smart enough to order 2 tires (and saved some $ on shipping). On close inspection of the other tire, it was starting to show impending signs of a similar failure. Removing the tire was moderately difficult but doable. Putting on the new one was not possible for me after much effort (with 2 people I may have succeededl) so I went to a tire shop. He had the right tire irons and with a little help from me placed both tires. Unless you're strong, have a good friend (or willing spouse) and a high threshold for frustration, strongly recommend a professional's help.

28;65.0;4.0;12.0;-982.44512605042;"12-08-2016\n12-31-2016  UPDATED TO 4 STARS - CG VERY EASY TO ADJUST\n\nREFER TO TH BOTTOM OF REVIEW FOR EDITS AND UPDATE INFORMATION.\n\nMy Segway miniPRO was delivered about one week ago.  I ordered the handle for it ahead of time directly from Ninebot ($40.00 less than listed on Amazon) and installed it immediately.  I have never tried the knee-steering, so can't comment on that aspect.  I did order an extra quick-connect, so I can easily change-out if I want.  The handlebar works beautifully, and makes it easy to steer with your body-weight only, and hands gently resting on the top of the bars.  I installed a wire basket, cell phone holder, headlight with removable flashlight, all from Amazon, on the top to make my work on the property easier.  It looks heavy and cumbersome, but isnt.  I can zip out to the mailbox, about 300 feet from my house, and retrieve mail and newspaper easily.  Or carry light tools if need-be.  It works beautifully on my grassy fields and for chasing alpacas.\n\nNow, with that said, this thing can be downright dangerous since when you remove the ""knee"" unit, it is no longer ""self-balancing"" except under power.  (Refer to edits below)  I found that out the hard way after downloading the App to my phone, and it immediately breathed life into my little MiniPRO.  It picked up the WiFi signal on the machine automatically, and it went into Power Mode.  Lights flashed, it let out beeps, the handle stood straight up, the thing backed up about one foot, the handle came crashing down on my head and knocked off my glasses (I was sitting on the edge of my recliner in the living room) then it stood back up in the balancing mode, and returned to its starting position.  All this action within seconds.  I couldn't have gotten out of the way if I wanted to since it all happened so fast.  This was the ""first-blood"" drawn with a brutal smack to my forehead below the hairline, and I hadn't even gotten on it yet.\n\nI did my practice runs in the house on carpeted floor, and passed with flying colors.  The App is very easy to follow, and you just push a button to release the speed-lock after doing .60 mile.  I don't have a clue why anyone in their right mind would want to go over 10 MPH on this thing, but then I am over the age limit to be using this Segway.  After it was delivered, I noted it said ""Ages 16 to 60 Only.""  I purchased it to use on my ranch since I have arthritis and knee-replacements, and have to walk long distances.  This does make mobility easier, and it's fun and practical to use.\n\nThe ""second-blood"" came yesterday on my front cement steps and patio when the Segway attacked me.  Since the handlebar does not self-balance (Refer to edit below), and there is no control switch to turn it off and on except down by the wheels, if it's slightly leaning forward or backward, it will take-off.  I turned it on and it again jumped to life in reverse, knocked me over (I had my helmet on) then added insult to injury and took off down the asphalt driveway with amazing speed only to be stopped by a pole.  The strength in this small unit is tremendous; I can't stress that enough.  And everything happens lightning fast.  In retrospect, maybe that is why you aren't supposed to be over 60 years old.\n\nMy helmet hit the steel stair-handrail, my right knee was bleeding and my right shoulder is bruised.  I think it actually ran over me, but I'm not sure.  It was all a blur, and I will make sure that never happens again.  This little transportation device hard-trains you to treat it properly.  I cant describe how careful I am when turning it off and on now.\n\nI will review this again when I get used to it.  For the time being I am only giving it 3 Stars because of the following:\n\n1. I never read anywhere that adding the handlebar renders the self-balance function useless. (Refer to edit below)\n2. The power switch is located in a ridiculous, hard to access, spot.\n3. I cant purchase a kick-stand for the MiniPRO anywhere, and have searched everywhere, including overseas. (Refer to edit below)\n4. I would be willing to pay extra for a self-balancing MiniPRO handlebar, but there doesnt seem to be any. (Refer to edit below)\n5. I would be willing to pay extra for either a remote power switch (not the phone) either hand-held or hard-mounted.\n\nMaybe there are answers for the above problems, and I just don't know what they are yet.  Help!  I appreciate any and all suggestions.\n\nThanksKathy\n\nEDIT 12-09-2016:\n\nI found out from Ninebot that the cg on the handlebar can be adjusted.  I need to download the information from their website which I have not yet done.  I want to make sure I have everything added that need-be prior to doing a cg test and reset.  Until I do that, I make sure the foot-pads are level prior to activation for safety measures.\n\nNOTE: Make sure that all your safety gear is stored with the unit, and wear the helmet at all times.\n\nSECOND EDIT 12-09-2016\n\nI included a picture of the ""Kickstand"" available at:\n[...]\n\nThe cost is $8.09 plus $2.35 for e-packet shipping from China.\nThis is a must-have item for any MiniPRO with the Handlebar, and it seems that absolutely NO ONE stocks them in the USA.\n\nTHIRD EDIT and UPDATE 12-14-2016\n\nIf anyone does purchase the handlebar for their MiniPRO, it will need to be Recalibrated via the gyroscope balance sensors.  The below link is to the PDF instructions on how to accomplish this task on the Ninebot App that you downloaded to your Smartphone.  It is a simple six-step process:\n\n[FOURTH EDIT and UPDATE 12-31-2016\n\nThe cg is very easily adjusted via the Smartphone app so I am increasing this to 4 Stars.  Since the unit has a quick disconnect, I believe more warnings should be posted in regards to the addition of the handlebar...IMO!]";HANDLEBAR ADDED:  Unit can be dangerous with handlebar installation - You have to adjust cg -

That being said, I have NEVER felt compelled to write a review...until now.  Furthermore, I did NOT receive this item at a discount for an honest review like so many reviews you read.  I am spending my time to do this in hopes that it will be a valuable review to potential buyers.\n\nAs of father of three boys, and a kid at heart, I am always in search of toys the entire family can enjoy.  I have been contemplating purchasing a hoverboard for nearly a year but was hesitant due to the safety issues that have come to light.  So, I waited...then the Segway miniPro comes into the picture.  I did my research on the Internet, read every review that was available, and decided to move forward to purchase the miniPro.  I can say without hesitation - THIS IS THE BEST PURCHASE I HAVE MADE IN A LONG TIME!!!\n\nThe Segway miniPro is durable, easy to ride, the range goes for over 10 miles, and it's fun-fun-fun!  It takes a bit to get used to initially but super easy to operate once you do.  Is it dangerous?  No more than riding a bike or anything else that moves at a decent speed.  As long as you adhere to the safety advice of the manufacturer when riding it, this thing will provide hours of fun.  My boys all ride it with ease and it even goes in the grass without issues.  I rode this thing all over the golf course by our home and it even went up/down inclines with no problems or loss of power.

I had no issues on learning to ride this and have tried it on several types of terrain and have had no problems. I live in 2nd floor apt, and so was concerned about getting it up and down the stairs. At the end of my hour ride, it ""seemed"" heavier, but I made back upstairs. Bought my unit on Amazon Prime Day, so felt I got a good price!  I recommend it for everyone! It's a blast!

4;68.0;1.0;6.0;-64.02470588235292;I was very excited to try this out. I wouldn't recommend this device or Segway devices to friends or family. The videos on youtube and reviews all look really interesting but I don't think these guys can handle selling on Amazon to a wide audience. Arrived defective. Couldn't set it up. Just kept beeping in an endless loop. No literature anywhere of what that means or what to do. Called customer care and they apparently know there are units shipping to Amazon with defective bluetooth boards. What? So I repackaged the unit and waste more time sending it back. I wouldn't buy a Segway if they ship defective devices. Told friends and family about it as it was supposed to be a gift. Not sure why they are shipping them to Amazon broken. What happened to QA? Maybe in hopes that Amazon will figure it out. Either way, avoid.;Great idea but it seems that they are shipping out defective units

This is my second Segway purchase as my original Segway Ninebot I purchased last Nov has ""'disappeared"" (stolen). So I bought a replacement one in May. I have been riding the Ninebot with no issues twice per day since last November and consider myself a seasoned rider. I also consider myself fit and healthy with good macro balance and physical coordination.\n\nThis contraption has suddenly turned evil. It is now acting like a bucking wild bronco since Thu Sep 7, 2017. It has suddenly started taking violent right spins threw me onto the pavement causing severe bruising. So after my first battering I tended to my scrapes and bruises wondering what happened. Thu evening, I parked it and left it off over night to check it in the morning.\n\nOn the morning of Friday Sep 8, 2017, I did the normal tire pressure check--all good, checked for and obstructions under and around each wheel axel, turned it on and tested it in the house. It seemed all good.\n\nI took it out as usual and rode very slowly and straight down the side walk watching for any odd movements and it seemed fine. Then the Segway suddenly accelerated into a violent right spin twisting out from under me and throwing me forward, around and onto my back. I had no time to react although I was watching it like a hawk.\n\nThat terrified me to the point it felt like someone hacked into the bot and was controlling it with the sudden movements.\n\nSegway needs to address this safety issue. I will be writing a detailed letter to Segway this weekend.\n\n-------Old review-------\n\nOriginally rated as a 5 star from Dec 2016 until Sep 7, 2017:\n\nEasy to maneuve, rolls like a carry-on, takes hills like an escalator!

Haha! At 49... I feel like a kid again! Whoohoo! ... Will post a video soon.\n\nApril 18, 2017\nStill rolling with the dog at least twice per day... I've since updated the firmware v3.7.1 and am very pleased at the better handling as the speed warning tilt was annoyingly much too steep to where I would lose access to the knee controller and nearly crashed once.\n\nIn any case I am at the point where riding is almost as easy and intuitive as walking. :)\n\nOne catch I should note is the tire valve adapter is threaded and the screw head is so small I find it really difficult to get on and off. I might suggest a slight design change of a taller threader connector. I have medium sized women's hands so I can only imagine the guys having a tougher time threading that valve adapter.\n\nIn any case, I've ridden and taken it onto the light rail train, in the mall (I ride carefully so I don't get banned by security... They just look at me as I roll by :) shopping is much more pleasant not having to walk with goods in hand. :)\n\nI've also rolled it around downtown Mountain View and love the hands-free maneuverability.. :) And doubling it as a shopping concierge, it holds two shopping bags on either side.

I found this after my kids and grand-kids tried to talk me into getting a ""scooter"", but all I could see was sympathetic looks from people. Now, I get into some GREAT conversations with people. I have freedoms I haven't had in quite a few years. After 7 back surgeries and the possibility of an 8th, I cannot walk for long periods of time--no more than 1/2 a block (and that is tough for someone who used to be a power walker walking 5 miles a day!)  And yes, our state law allows for it to be used just like a mobility scooter anywhere pedestrians go. It balances BEAUTIFULLY. I have practiced at length and am now very proficient. Now, since the weather has turned, I will be taking it window shopping at the malls. Please check with YOUR state laws on this. Read the instructions and follow the training prompts. You won't be disappointed. Balance is AMAZING! Easy operation! Watch the tight turns--it will dump you! Fits in the trunk just fine.

5;71.0;5.0;6.0;-109.53086956521737;This is my second one (for the wife).  We added the handlebars instead of knee bar (go with More4Mini).  We are both over 70 years old, sorry about that, but they are lots of fun and not that difficult or dangerous - safer than a bike.  We ride them in the neighborhood and plan to take them to a lakeside cabin for trail riding (paved only).  They can be maneuvered even in tight spaces, crowded sidewalks, etc., so take them on the boardwalk or wherever a wheelchair is allowed.  We still like to walk but if you want to cover a longer distance and feel like a poor man's motorcycle rider, go for it.\n\n9/24/17 Update\n\nOK, threw them in the Escape and took them to Michigan for a weeks vacation.  Located some paved trails and we were off, riding for an hour or more in very nice areas (get bicycle trail maps) around Traverse City.  We still walk a lot but love the ability to cover so much more ground and see so much more.  We have never run into another Segway rider - strange.  Zero problems so far even when the trail went to fine gravel but not as smooth a ride.;Oh, Yea!  Even for Old Folks

98;73.0;5.0;12.0;-30.13785714285713;Just finished riding 6.75 miles and this device is awesome.  I have had a Segway i180 for 10 years and the construction of of mini pro is great.  It takes longer to get comfortable using the mini pro as compared to a full sized Segway but the weight and ability to quickly put this in the trunk is great.  I was concerned before purchasing the mini pro on how it would perform on steep hills and I can tell you that it has no problem going up steep hills (I am 175lbs).  After 6.75 miles the App indicates that I have 9.2 miles left before it runs out of juice. I don't know if I would have spent $1,000 for this device but I am very satisfied having spent $699 on the Prime day special.;Quality device that handles hills nicely.
127;74.0;5.0;12.0;-185.49111913357396;I received the minipro a few days ago and here are my initial comments.\nThe product seems to be the quality I would expect from Segway.\nThe setup and unboxing was easy.\nYou are required to install the Segway Ninebot app to your phone.  This will allow you to control and configure your preferences, use the remote control, register your mini, etc.\nThe app is fairly decent but in my opinion requires additional work.  Once you create your username you cannot change it.  So beware that if you use your email address or your name it will be displayed in the stats along with the other registered users keeping track of your mileage, etc.\nI had trouble getting the tutorial to complete in order to increase the speed limit despite finishing the tutorial several times.  Suddenly the tutorial completed and I still was not able to set the speed beyond 6.2mph.  After riding for awhile the speed finally unlocked and now the mni is much easier to ride.\nDue to the light weight of the mini the remote control will not work well unless it is on hard smooth pavement.  If the mini encounters a small rock or stick it will not be able to overcome the obstacle.  The extension handle works great and the mini is easy to walk beside you.\nOverall I think the mini is great for someone who cannot afford the storage space of a large Segway.  I carry this in my RV where storage space is limited.\n\nUPDATE: 7/1/16\nChanging my rating to 5 stars because the mini is a great device despite the quality of the app.;The setup and unboxing was easy. You are required to install the Segway Ninebot ...
11;75.0;4.0;7.0;-624.1303319502074;"I bought this for myself for Christmas 2016 mainly cause I was always late for work. Now...I'm late to work a lot faster!...lol. From the get go, I didn't know how to ride one of these things but right out of the box, after syncing it up with an app on your phone there is a ""driving course"" that teaches you how to ride it. I'd say it took me around 45 mins to comfortably get it down. It is now June 4th and I have long since got comfortable with riding it. BUT...now the battery is at the point where I almost have to charge it everyday but that was expected at some point. But there are a lot of factors brought it to this point.\nFor one, I weight 200 Lbs. another is that I usually ride it as fast as it'll let me. Both of which drain the battery pretty fast. I mainly use it to and from work. I'm also carrying a shoulder bag that possibly weighs another 15 Lbs or so. I'd guess that if I was 125 or 150 Lbs, the battery would have lasted a lot longer. Speaking of battery...I tried ordering  a battery replacement and they've been out of stock for a while. So that's another thing to take into consideration. If I don't get a replacement battery soon, this thing will be sitting in my apt till I can get one and batteries are pretty pricey: A Lithium Battery for Segway MiniPro (240wh) goes for $150 and a Lithium Battery for Segway MiniPro (310wh) for $295. both of which are sold out. So that is one thing that I'll have to take into consideration is that if the battery is only going to last for roughly five months, will it be worth it, replacing the battery every five months? But other than that, I love riding it around town.\n\nUPDATE addition: As I mentioned in my above comment, for the past several weeks, I've noticed that the battery seemed to be dying faster and that the Segway felt like it was slowing down or felt that it had ""lack of power"" that it used to have. Well today I was waiting in a crosswalk, heading back to work when a man next to me told me that my left tire was flat...or pretty low. I couldn't tell from above but that made sense now. For the past couple of weeks I noticed it was making like a rubbing sound and several of the color covers fell off.\nWhen I got to work, I had a friend help me fill them with air. He had a tire gauge and checked both tires and they were both pretty low! We filled them close to the suggested psi and when I got back on and rode just a very short distance, I could feel a big difference! And since then I could feel it going a lot smoother. So this is a possibility of why the battery was dying faster. It was working extra hard to transport a 200 Lb. man on really low, almost flat tires! So now...I'm investing in a tire gauge and check the air pressure regularly! And it looks like if the plastic color covers start falling off? It seems like it might be a sign that the tires are low since they'll end up pushing on the little color plastic covers. But still, it's a good idea to regularly check the air pressure in the tires from time to time. Since I put air back in the tires, it feels 100% better! A lot smoother.\nUpdate 6-28-17 I don't know why but can't find a battery replacement for this segway, anywhere online! That's one thing to take into consideration since the original battery will eventually die. It is the most expensive item to replace on this machine so you'd think they would have replacement batteries but I have yet to find where to find one. So I suggest by the time you're looking to buy this machine first look to see if there is some site to where they sell battery replacements for this machine.";I love it but....

12;77.0;5.0;7.0;-558.4864906832297;"Let me share some of what have I learned since purchasing my minipro during Summer of 2016:\n\nThis has been a great way to improve my quality of life.  Being officially disabled means I can use the minipro to roll to Dr appointments and to get my dog some exercise. Is practically no-impact for my joints.\n\nIt weighs 28 pounds, goes 11mph, and allows me to feel the wind in my hair again.\n\nFYI it ships with tires at a low PSI (about 30). You'll want to inflate them to somewhere between 40 and 45psi. They are tubeless tires, so leaving them flatter makes them more likely to lose air. The tires are inflatable with a Schrader valve nozzle (just like cars and traditional bicycles use).  Changing out the tires on your own can break the warranty and looks like a great way to break a sweat too. If the wheels ever develop any slow air seepage issues, Segway approves of and recommends trying a silicon sealant product called Slime to seal the tires from within.\n\nIf you buy the Segway from Amazon in the US, and the tire pops or has a puncture or stem valve problem, SegwayUSA will provide warranty service in the first year (at their expense... but who knows how long it would take to get your ride returned if you send it in for service). Also, if you send it in for service, there is the chance Segway could update your minipro's firmware: FYI.. some riders insist that older versions of the internal software are preferable to the 'latest and greatest' software updates. (The newer software is generally 'crippled' with safety features and improvements that hopefully prolong product life by lessening stress on the motors). It is a newer product so there are regular tweaks being made to both the device's internal software and to the phone-based companion apps.\n\nThe ninebot batteries are not approved for transport on commercial airliners.. AKA so much for bringing your Segway on every vacation.\n\nOnce the initial setup is complete, the minipro can operate with or without a smartphone, which relies on bluetooth connectivity. The Ninebot app is a battery hog (even when not riding) so consider finding an obsolete iPhone or Android device to dedicate to your Ninebot minipro excursions.\n\nLong story short:  these are a load of fun, easy to learn, and designed to be ADA compliant (use them to get around stores instead of using those awful motorized shopping carts... but you may need to show your Disabled ID card to security at some places).\n\nAlso, you can enable an artificial speed limit for anyone who doesn't want to break the 10mph barrier... or for friends who are curious and want to try your machine.\n\nWishing you all smooth riding... It is a fun way to get out and about, provided your round trip is 14 miles or less.\n\nAnd oh yeah:  it even has headlights that automatically turn on when ambient light gets low, and there are what amounts to turn signal indicators on the rear.  As long as you aren't TOO heavy (am 230 lbs here... which is 10 over the official limit), and don't need to tackle hills steeper than 15 you are good to go!\n\nPS.  Some people say the same unit is available from China for cheaper... but THIS unit has been thoroughly tested by UL and doesn't require overseas shipping for delivery and/or service.  No flaming from this 'hoverboard' (or should I call it a personal transport device?)\n\nMy segway fits well in a duffle bag, requires minimal spine and hip motion to drive, and continues to impress; both myself and the people who look and wonder 'Did that guy come from the future!?""";Able the Disabled

59;79.0;5.0;10.0;-11.996639344262263;Ive had my Segway for a little over a week now, AND It is the best money Ive spent in a long time. The only problem I had was a flat tire totally my fault though. Anyway I called Segway Distribution and they told me I could just take it to any bike repair shop. Sure enough the bike shop in my neighborhood patched the tire and it only cost me $5.00. Also I have to give credit to the customer service department they were really friendly and very helpful. As far as the actual Segway goes, its everything and more than I expected. It is really well made and its FAST! Its smooth. You are going to love it too.;5 stars all the way!!! Great Customer Service, helped me with my flat tire!!!
78;80.0;3.0;10.0;-622.3031468531467;Ok so as a professional adult I have to say that I still slightly feel embarrassed using this on the streets.  It still turns heads and for me I wish these things were more widely accepted, used, less dangerous and more easy to store.  I also wish it could be a device you could use to put groceries or other hanging from the stick and it would allow you to control it with the remote.  It's a great device but still needs a little improvement.\n\nPROS:\n-This thing can go pretty fast, but the minute you reach the maximum levels of speed it quickly beeps and slows you down, which is completely annoying.\n-It's sturdy and seems reliable in quality.\n-You can turn off the lights to make it not so flashy, except for the turning lights which seems dumb bc they're a yellow colour that doesn't mean anything to anyone and doesn't really make anyone think you're turning.\n-Battery life so far has been good.\n-Clean and conspicuous color.\n-PRETTY FAST.\n\nCONS:\n-It scratches easily so prepare to get your first dings on your wheel's rims.\n-Remote control access sounds cool, but it is so sensitive that it's hard to control the device with your phone, you tell it to turn and it turns too much that you pass the direction - you finally just decide to pick it up or move it from the handle.\n-BEWARE OF BREAKING - this item does not slow down easily so you have to slow down quite ahead of your stop otherwise you will go flying off into your stopping area.\n-Device can start spinning at high speed if you pick it up without turning it off.  Careful with stairs, turn off your item to pick it up.\n-Still a little pricey for what you get.\n-The anti-theft mechanism is pretty useless.  It just vibrates and does a small sound that hardly means anything...it should sound louder and have a GPS ability to your phone.  This brings me to a big issue with this being a transport device.  When you reach your final destination the device becomes a nuisance.  Going into the store you have to pull it with you and it becomes annoying to direct it.  Often I want to use it to go grocery shopping or go somewhere but it becomes a security liability where you can't let it out of your eyesight so you can only use it in certain occasions where it can be stored safely - otherwise you just purchased a 3yr old with the brain of a 1yr old that keeps bumping into things and makes you fear someone will pick it up and run out with it.\n-TURNING IT OFF -- it falls.  So it should have a sleeping mode where minimum battery is consumed but keeps item upright to stand next to you.\n\nWISHFUL IMPROVEMENTS & SUGGESTIONS:\n-Ok so, one of the greatest ideas for this thing is if it were able to carry groceries for you.  With the phone remote capability I wish I could put some groceries on the stick part and let it carry things into the house but place things on the stick and it will begin to turn and assume you're on it.  As a carrying helper it would be great to set it to follow only remote instructions and let you place items on it to carry.\n-Rubber covers or replaceable rims bc they will scratch and man is it painful when you see the scratches on your expensive segway.\n-Generally speaking this type of device is a liability, you can easily run into someone, or on someone's foot on the streets.  Albeit intuitive it isn't something to be cocky with you can do some damage.\n-It's great when riding but once you reach your destination it's a freaking eye sore and not easy to hide.  I dream of the day I can walk into my work office with this and not be looked at in a silly way, it's still viewed as a teen's toy and not as a viable transport method (sigh).\n-The beeping, beep beep beep it gets annoying.  can we make it less dramatic.;Ok I love it and hate it...this is like a 3yr old with the brain of a 1yr old

As I could not do the ride without the add-on ""Handle Bar"" stem option, I bought that as well.\n\nThis made the device highly unstable, and it would launch on it's own, take off from under my feet, and I have bruises, and was left bloodied after a single ride...\n\nThe I Phone holder on the top of the handle bar stem is crap.

86;84.0;3.0;9.0;-337.5742660550458;I bought one of those hoverboards, right before the news of the fires started. Luckily, mine never has caught fire *knock on wood*.  While the hoverboard is indeed fun to use, it has major limitations. It doesn't handle transitions between levels of pavement very well (e.g. if the pavement is 1/4 of an inch higher than your driveway asphalt), it doesn't work on grass/dirt, if one wheel goes into the grass while the rest is on the pavement, you'll go flying off it, it doesn't like gravel, etc.  All things consistent with what you'd expect with something with small, firm, wheels and a low power motor.\n\nDon't let the design of this fool you. This is a completely different animal than the hoverboard.  It has large, inflated wheels, making it handle bumps and various surfaces easily. I can go from the driveway to the road, to gravel, and grass covered yard all without issue.  The miniPRO is a true transportation device, whereas the hoverboard is more of a toy (a fun toy, but a toy nonetheless).  The downside is that if you've gotten accustomed to steering a hoverboard, you'll find yourself having to stop and think how to turn left and right.  However, the steering with the bar is an improvement over the hoverboard because with the hoverboard, a bump can cause the shifting in your weight to initiate a turn, whereas a good bump will only slow you down a little with the miniPRO.\n\nYou will want to either upgrade or downgrade the firmware, depending on your preference. The firmware that it currently ships with is utter crap.\n\nUpdate - had it out on the road today and got hit with the speed limiter thing where it starts leaning backwards.  Ok, no biggie, or so I thought. The second time it did it, it kept leaning me backwards more and more, to the point that I started to lose my balance!  That's a terrible configuration.  This is with it upgraded to the 1.3.1 firmware.  I'm wishing I would have downgraded it to 1.1.7 instead.\n\n@Segway - fix it, please!\n\nEdit again - Today, while going down a slight hill with a curve, the mini decided to lean back so far that suddenly the steering arm was behind my legs, put of reach. When it did this happened to be at the same time that I needed to turn. I found myself having to jump off as it ran off of the road. Not good, Segway!;Great fun, except when it isnt

No I didn't update Firmware even though app may ask to so Don't update it!  Seems to ride better for me with Sensor Sensitivity turned off after trying both ways.  Battery life is better than any Lithium powered device I have ever owned.  Headlights work only if sensor on Bot is in darkened areas.  Remote movement works best on smooth surfaces or will move remotely if you give it a slight push start over rough terrain.  Phone App can monitor charging status while Bot is charging.

106;86.0;5.0;9.0;-222.38957831325297;"Amazon suckered me into buying this while it was a Prime Day deal. So far I'm glad I did. I've put 10 miles on it far riding around town today, and I have enough battery to do 8 more according to its meter. I can see why some might want it to go faster, but when you consider having to turn, and how quick this thing turns, more speed would be bad. I almost wrecked when a kid got awestruck, forgot about the bike he was riding, and I had to zig out of the way while doing full speed. Luckily I was able to one hop out of the spin out... For the first time I truly understand why Grandpa always wanted the fastest golf cart on the course. Flying by people pushing strollers or walking dogs and then hearing them go ""what is that?"" or ""did you see that?"" is pretty cool. A couple times I caught myself thinking ""I may never walk again."" If only this thing did stairs. A wedge or spinner attachment might also come in handy.\n\n6 Month Update:\nI'd rate this higher if I could. There are few products I could say that about. I can honestly say I ride the Segway more than I ever imagined I would. I've traveled hundreds and hundreds of miles. If I lived somewhere free from snow + ice + subzero tempts I'd have gone twice as far by now. I ride this everywhere I can- to get my groceries, get a meal, go to the bar, ride the bike trails or the lakes or to find the next great drone video shot,.. as long as I can get there and back again and be under the weight limit I take my segway. I'll probably buy a second one soon as a spare just in case this one ever dies on me and they stop selling them, that's how much I enjoy it.";All its missing is the wedge or spinner.

32;89.0;4.0;7.0;-671.6115734720415;"I needed a commute solution. It's 3.5 miles from my house to the bus stop. Walking takes longer than I'd like, a bicycle is clumsy for the bus, and an electric unicycle is a bit difficult on crowded sidewalks, because they're tough to balance at very slow speeds. So why not the miniPRO? I got one this fall and over 200 miles later, I'm sold. A few quick fixes and this is a five-star product for sure.\n\nEASY TO LEARN. I learned to ride this in less than 15 minutes. So did each of my young daughters, and my niece as well. Separating speed control (feet) from steering (knees) makes this much more stable than a hoverboard. it's really in a completely different class. I've put in over 200 miles on this device and feel quite safe, as I've learned my limits on it. Have I fallen? Yes, twice. The first time I was messing around, so I'll take the blame. The second time, I fell off going around the corner on a steep hill. I learned not to do that (see piloting hints below).\n\nDECENT FOR LAST-MILE COMMUTING. I use this to get to the bus from my house, and to get around downtown. It's great because it takes almost no skill to go at an arbitrarily slow speed. Wait at a light then go along behind a slow group? No problem, easy. Then when you get your opening, slalom into the open and pick up the pace. But it's more awkward than it needs to be to take it on a bus or train, as I'll detail below.\n\nPILOTING HINTS. * Watch the sensitive steering on downhills! * When you hit a bump or rough patch, spread your knees a little so you don't contact the steering on the bumps; you can get over most things you'll find on a sidewalk that way. * For rough terrain, slow down but not TOO slow. Hard to go over a big bump when you're inching along. * If you find it beeping at you a lot, ease off on the speed just a touch and you'll find it easier on your feet and calves. * When the incline is really steep, get off and walk it, especially downhill. * In a crowd, consider powering it off and just dragging it; the assist mode can be awkward around a bunch of people, or on a steep hill. *The headlight is bright enough to let others know you're coming, but not sufficient to give useful warning about sidewalk hazards ahead. Consider carrying a flashlight, which is also useful to shine at cars considering crushing you in the crosswalk!\n\nWISH LIST. This is nearly a five-star device. Here are three simple things they need to address to make it the perfect device for last-mile commuting. First, they need to find a way to make it easier to carry. It has no horizontal handhold other than the lower deck, and that's hard to grab sometimes. They need to offer an accessory handle that will let you lift this 28-pound device with one hand without twisting it unnaturally (I hurt my wrist rather badly doing this). Second, they need to make it easier to have on a bus. Its wheels are always free-rolling when it's powered off, so they should add a ""chock mode"" that doesn't beep or anything, just stops the wheels from turning. It wouldn't matter if it used a little battery. It's so awkward when you have this on the floor by your feet, and the bus driver hits the gas, and the miniPRO rolls back into your shins - or over your seatmate's toes! Third, they need to sell or recommend a good locking device. It doesn't need to be any more effective than a bike lock, but good enough to stop the walk-by opportunist. Even if they just sold a clamp that would go around the deck and the steering bar so you could secure it with a bike lock, that would make it possible to leave it at the bike rack while you shopped.\n\nSUMMARY. I love this thing. It's practical and fun. I find myself talking with random strangers about it all the time, and I'm pretty sure I've sold a few. Don't buy it if you hate being noticed! Its ability to operate safely at the slowest walking speeds make it the most civilized urban sidewalk sharer I know of.";Not perfect, but the best I've found

Now, the Ninebot has answered that issue.  I play a lot of golf, and enjoy walking.  My issue in the past was my feet are very bad from arthritis.  I was able to ride this on the golf course, very easily!  I had a Bat Caddy cart that carries my golf bag, with a remote.  The Ninebot was perfect playing golf and no issues going up/down hills.  I do recommend that those who use it on a golf course, use care when traveling over uneven ground.  I like using it because it is great to feel the wind in your hair while playing.  My golf course buddies are going crazy over it, and most can't believe the price.  While I picked mine up at a reduced price (Amazon Prime email alerting me of the great price), I would gladly buy it at the current price.  I checked other sites such as eBay, but no one could match the Amazon Prime price (even used).\n\nMost everyone I've encountered while riding this, thought it was just another ""hoverboard"".  I quickly corrected that notion but showing how the unit stands up by itself, much easier to mount/dismount, and very easy to balance or steer.  I learned how to ride in my great room, by using my couch & wall, but was flying around furniture within minutes!  I even taught my daughter & her 2 sons, aged 8 & 10 within minutes.  I'm almost 69!!!\n\nNOTE: I highly suggest that those that are not able to balance or use a bicycle or such, refrain from riding the Ninebot at full speed or on uneven ground.  I rode a skateboard when I was younger, as well as being a downhill skier, so I'm very good at balance & using my balance to direct my movements on the Ninebot.  Those that don't have those experiences, take care using the Ninebot.  I also warn those who want to 'race' or 'X-Game' around on the Ninebot.  If you want to do that, get a Segway V1 or V2 (a single wheel driven bone breaker :-)";Perfect Segway for those who want urban transportation,

People should be aware that the app is packed with Chinese spyware that will fingerprint your device, log usage and report it to third parties.  I don't see any notification about this and certainly no way to opt out of it, so the privacy concern is significant.  There is no way to link the Segway to the app without going online, and until completed you won't be able to use it fully.  It will beep constantly and limit the speed, as well as being unable to access app features like customization.\n\nBottom line is they're trying too hard to control the end user experience--leveraging the app as way to sign us up as a 'userbase' and push social features and other fluff that isn't integral to owning one.

The ONLY practical differences are\n(1) the knee control bar: minipro is more robust, easily removable and has an extension rod that is very useful if you want to walk the minipro with you in the supermarket/library, for example.\n(2) the wheel caps: I cannot care less about nonsense like this -- and you should not.\n(3) a higher rated battery and 2 more powerful motors, improvement in the order of ~20%.  It may help if you ride on a lawn, up a steep incline, etc (if that is your thing).\n(4) some official certification on battery/charger for the minipro (but not the mini) -- but they have the same circuit AFAIW -- so if that piece of ""certification"" puts your mind at ease on fire hazards about Li-rechargeable batteries, you've that.\n\nBut here is a problem -- I have not seen any after-market upgrades for the minipro, but there are quite a few for the mini and it makes a BIG difference.  Kick-stands are something that both models have in the aftermarket so that is not a problem.  But...\n\n I did not know that, after I bought a handle bar and upgraded the mini to hand-control (and no longer using the built-in knee control), it was SO MUCH more relaxing to ""drive"" the mini on pedestrian walkway that now I MUST HAVE the same thing on the miniPro but I could not find any handle bar upgrade on it (yet).  This is HUGE.  It is so much more fun driving it with hands than your knees.\n\nThis is the reason why I give the miniPro a 4-star rating.

The headlights are nice but not meant for nighttime driving on a sidewalk.

I have had to get the entire knee bar replaced because of the cracks in the plastic by the screws. The more you use this, all the bumps in the roads/sidewalks cause the screws to get loose, and then the vibrations crack the plastic. Looking at the owner forums and this is a WIDESPREAD issue. Warranty will cover the replacement, but it is a fundamental DESIGN FLAW. My replacement bar is already starting to crack in the exact same spot as before.\n\nI commute on this to work ~1.5 miles in a big city (each way) and it has replaced taking an Uber.

The only complaint is that *#%! Speed governor.  It is almost dangerous.  Cruising along, on an open field, going bicycle speed and it kicks you back to slow you down.  Which, if the incessant beeping hasn't aggravated you enough, the constant braking will.  If you decide to be defiant and ride anyway, your calves will rebel later.

I wanted something that would be practical for getting me around, that wouldn't require me getting to work with sweat running down my face.

Im going to be sad when winter hits and ill have to go back to using my car daily :-(\n\nEH: So, day 1 of having this, I wanted to get myself well acquainted with it being I was going to be taking it to work daily and didn't want something to happen on my travels that left me walking with this heavy machine (and let me tell you, this beast is HEAVY). The first day of riding it casually around on the sidewalks, I stopped and hopped off on a park bench, and noticed two of the small spokes on my left wheel (1 gray 1 red) were missing. Im guessing the cracks in the sidewalk made them pop off, but retracing my steps I have NOOOO idea where they went. Luckily for me, they give you an extra grey and red spoke. Day 2 while riding to work, I saw one fly off in the corned of my eye. Didn't break, just fell off. These things are EXTREMELY easy to lose and I have noooooo idea where to get anymore of them. Now everyday before I get on/ after I get off I check to see if any are loose or popping out. Very annoying as you want your machine looking pristine much like you would your car. I just wish the wheels possibly had a metal cap over them instead of the plastic one with spokes that frequently fall off.\n\nAnother issue Ive been having is when I get off and pick up the device, sometimes the things wheels start spinning very fast, and with the awkward shape of the scooter. you have to hold it out and over for it not to hit you but you cant set it down till it stops. I don't know if my unit is defective or what. Ive recalibrated several times, and it will still do it on occasion. Kinda scary, not a total loss.\n\nThe last thing is when I set it down sometimes, it will just fall over and not try to balance it self at all, almost like its off..... which it isn't. Again, I'm not sure if my unit is defective or not, but its a little wonky sometimes.\n\nOverall I'm giving this guy a 4/5, even though I love it I just wish it wasn't falling apart so quickly/ acting crazy (everyone knows crazy comes later in the relationship).;Not a hoverboard.

At first we just ran around the block hunting Pokemon and spent a couple days off rolling around the park and the lake with the dogs. Now i am at 120 miles and using it to go to the store and back and forth to work. This thing is no joke. I now use it as a viable source of transportation. On the weekend we hop the bus to go downtown and visit a couple of bars and a restaurant.;I received one as a gift and shortly after bought ...

And even then, it fights you by tilting back and dropping the speed to about half that when you get up to 10mph, so you end up fighting it the whole time speeding up, slowing down, speeding up, slowing down.  It would probably get 20 miles per charge if it wasn't fighting you the whole time.  This action also removes the steering mechanism from between your legs, often getting hung on clothing as it slides back into place, making for a dangerous situation that can throw you off by suddenly turning unexpectedly.  Great job Segway lawyers, you killed a potentially groundbreaking travel option.;Twice the cost of a Chinese hoverboard, half the speed.
61;110.0;5.0;6.0;-166.5416666666666;"So this is my very first personal transporter type device ever. So I was a little skeptical about it based on the ""hoverboard"" reputation at this time. But the reviews were pretty consistent and plentiful as well as many videos on YouTube. So I went for it.\n\nRight off the bat....amazing. Right out of the box, not a single glitch with either the Segway or the app. When I activated the Segway, a firmware update was due. It downloaded and installed in less than 30 seconds.\n\nAbout the complaint with the speed limiter, I have not experienced this ""sudden"" deceleration a lot of people speak of. Yes it beeps when u go too fast and yes it slows you down, but it's VERY gentle and controllable.\n\nMy experience so far is that when you get to speed, stand up almost straight up and it keeps it right about at 10mph. It just takes a little practice.\n\nThe only gripe is when you use the handle to ""walk"" it around with. It's not as intuitive as one would think but I think after some practice that should become easier.\n\nIn short, worth every penny. So much so....I'm buying a second one after less than 24 hours with the first one.\n\nThe build quality is fantastic and after riding it for 1.5 hours and 5 miles around my neighborhood, it said I still had 11 miles of range left. So that's OVER the advertised range. That's pretty unreal.\n\nI'd totally recommend this buy. Well done Ninebot!";Awesome!
23;111.0;4.0;5.0;-2009.8152694898938;"Update: 2018.02.13\n\nOver 750km/464miles on it now, and I have several batteries which I've swapped out during my trips for extended range.  For long range travel the foot pads are really uncomfortable.  It's still working and I've had no issues other than with their iOS App and the company servers.  I crashed it once not paying attention to a pot hole, and one bad crash for an unknown reason (not road conditions).  It's possible it was too much acceleration when the battery was low, but it seems it was something else.  The machine had less damage than I did.  I wear safety gear so I was ok, but very sore.\n\nI've since mounted proper lights on it for travel after sunset and before dawn. Traffic is lower here at that time and more chances to see wildlife.\n\nThey introduced a new so called 2018 edition, which has a downgraded battery. I would advise not to get that one and get this one if it is still available.  They also started selling the MiniPro Lite originally designed for the Asian domestic market; it's junk in comparison, but it can be quite a bit cheaper, so if you're just buying for younger kids it might be worth a look.  Some people can't ride these very far without getting sore feet, so in those cases it might be OK as well, or if used only in doors in a factory or warehouse.\n\nIt's really sad they didn't introduce a real upgrade to this machine yet.  Such potential unrealized yet.\n\nUpdate: 2017.08.20\n\nThe iOS App is worse than I knew before.  During the summer there have been at least two events where the company servers were not working which meant you could not log-in to the App, and even if you were previously connected it would not connect you to your device even though that only requires Bluetooth.  This is UNACCEPTABLE!  When the sever fails there are no messages on the device of any problems it just never connects (this is pathetic).  This Summer I was also forced to update the App to get connected again  (UNACCEPTABLE), the new app has serous bugs and screwed up some people's machines, so then the got around to patching that and we all had to update again.  The new app is worse than the original, but on iOS you have no choice to go back.\n\nStill now with more than 300 miles on the machine I leave the rating at 4 Stars as I have enjoyed it, but the software is total &*&^.  Also if you buy a second machine and register it under the same account and username, you have to complete the training again and set it up all over again.  How stupid is that?\n\nThey can be fun and very useful, but make an informed decision.  A new Smart/Plus version has been announced over seas, so it's possible that it may come to the US and this one will be discontinued. The new model has it's own problems and design issues and unfortunately does not fix the biggest issue with the MiniPro model, it goes in a different direction.\n\nUpdate: 2017.06.01\n\nI updated my rating to 4 stars (from 3).\n\nAfter traveling more than 200km I'm impressed with the device and it's sturdy build.  The software has been updated to allow a better riding experience at top speed with the degree of tilt-back reduced and a more gradual application with a less instantaneous alarm to account for small variations in speed and sensor readings.\n\nIn general my initial review below stands unedited, but I'm less critical of the device as it is what it is.  Some hacks can be done to increase range and other issues so that lessons the issues in some circumstances.  The price reduction to $499-$599 pice is very competitive with alternative devices such as electric-scooters and hoverboards and this works much better off road and on hills.\n\nStill waiting for an upgraded model by someone, but this one has served me well.  I got a second one for a special project.\n\nOriginal Review Unedited\n=====================\nThe NineBot MiniPro by Segway.  Wow what a mouthful.  Lets call it the MiniPro even though it really does not tell you anything about it.  Its not a Hoverboard, its not a Segway, but its a hybrid of both.\n\nFor just over a month this has been a fun recreational toy.  I now have over 70km (~44 miles) on mine just going around the neighborhood, mostly on streets, but gravel roads, very lumpy slopped grass, horizontally sloped sidewalks and grass have all be traversed with little effort. Its not comfortable to ride on gravel even though it works ok.  It was very easy to learn and I never had any falls or close calls on it yet.  Im always wearing full safety gear though as the roads here are very narrow with lots of blind curves.\n\nIts a fun recreational form of transportation, but definitely is more suited to some activities or uses than others.  For example they mention commuting; I was thinking I could use it to possibly commute 10 miles per day.  On a warm day that would surely be at the limits for a medium sized adult based on battery capacity if you only wanted to charge it once. The second issue is I would need to use the streets and the speed limit of 10mph (16km/h) is too low for safe travel on the roads in my area.  With the current speed limit it will be beeping all the time and trying to force you to slow down which creates an even more dangerous situation.\n\nIndoor commuting in a warehouse, or on a corporate campus would mostly be fine.  A slow stroll through a small town looking at shops is fine or a slow pace on a walking path.  With different laws in different states, different laws in different cities, and authorities often not knowing the laws it can be a bit challenging to know whats what and avoid trouble and trouble makers.  I didn't take it into any shopping malls to see if they would allow it; some do allow full Segway machines.  This would actually a good use for it if you are at a massive mall and are comfortable riding it around people. This usage is more within the devices capabilities for speed and battery life.\n\nThe device seems well built and has good engineering.  I did have a quality control issue with the Quick-Release for the steering bar; it was not adjusted correctly and one of the adjustment screws had a manufacturing defect.  The battery indicator on the MiniPro is not visible while riding thats a less than optimal design. They expect you to monitor it with the Smartphone App.\n\nThe battery not big enough for a medium sized adult the battery is greatly lacking.  It looks like they also limit the charge on the battery to extend the life of the battery if you can believe the App data.  This is a bit crazy as I think people will be mostly tired of it before they need a new battery given its current usage profiles.  This may not be true for everyone, but I need more battery.  They basically need to double the battery capacity to make the device really deliver on its potential.\n\nThe software (Smartphone App) is pretty good.  It works well most of the time, but like most software it has some quirks that one will need to work around. If it fails to connect the simplest method to get it to connect is to kill the app turn on the MiniPro, start the App, instant connection every time for me.  Connections can be more problematic if the App is started before the device is turned on or if it has been running in the background from a previous trip and then you want to connect again.  I ignored all the social media type features of the App.  They should make an App that is compatible with a Smart-Watch so that speed, mileage, and battery status can be viewed easily without having to take out ones phone all the time which many do while in motion which is a big safety issue.  The app wants to use the GPS for location and crap like that, but I just denied it those permissions I have no need for that stuff in the App.  It is nice though to have the app collect your mileage stats (you don't need GPS for this).  A big bug in the Average speed calculation exists though as it includes the idle time, when the device is not moving, So if you stop for a rest, or get back but wait 10min to check the stats the average speed is completely wrong.  If you shut off the device before you check your stats in the App then the information other than total milage on the device is gone.  I try to take a screen shot after each ride for my records, there does not seem to be a history of your trips that I can find.  That can be annoying.  Battery estimates are optimistic and simplistic, if I use up 50% of the battery going X miles, it will still often tell me I can get twice X with the remaining 50% as an example.  Clearly I would not depend on its estimates very much. I have not tested the accuracy of its distance calculation, but a very simple check on google maps and GPS shows its about right for a 1km distance, but I need to check a farther distance to see any real error. I plan to do that with GPS sometime soon.\n\nThe fact that you need to have a Smartphone, email address, and yet another username/login to use the device fully is not the best design. Younger riders may not have one, and many other choose not to.  You cant really get started either without one because its needed initially to complete training tutorial to allow the device to unlock a reasonable speed and then for another 10km after that.  A tablet can be used as well and Im sure most people can come up with one, but   I don't have a better solution although there should definitely be a way to bypass all the tutorial stuff right on the device and make it fully functional.  I forgot to record my password since I was in a hurry to try it out, but fortunately the App is keeping me logged in so I don't have to deal with a lost password for a while. I just don't like requiring a smartphone to get the device going, and a personalized login in crazy.  This should be completely optional.\n\nMy 70km assessment is that this is a great device, but really needs to have twice the battery capacity and a 50% increase in top speed (~25km.hr) to really be viable/practical for a large number of usage scenarios.  Currently a bigger Segway is quite a bit bigger, harder to buy, 5-7x more expensive and you don't have your hands free.  The other alternative is the EUC (electric unicycle) which is the direction most people are going.  its roughly 50%-150% more expensive for a decent one with the capabilities Im looking for (Ninebot sometimes sells ones for less or equal the MiniPro but its too limited).  The downside is they are much harder to learn and more dangerous.  Still they are worth looking at because they are also a lot more versatile operating on different terrain, higher speeds, and greater portability.  There are a wide range of EUC models from different manufacturers for different needs.  Younger people seem to be able to learn them very fast.\n\nYour location and usage scenarios will play a large part in your satisfaction.  Currently, at 70km, I rate the MiniPro 3.5/5 stars, but since there are no 1/2 stars on Amazon I give it 3 stars as it does not warrant 4 for me with its current battery and speed limitations.";Fun and Good Design - Limited by Battery and Top Speed

A range of 14 miles and top speed of 10mph it is the perfect personal conveyance.  However, you really need the handlebars to feel fully confident and safe.  Once you add the handlebars you must have the kickstand to keep it balanced when you get off.  No problem buying these parts but the price is astonomically high adding up to half the cost of the Segway itself.  With safety in mind, I think the Segway should come with the handlebars and make the knee bar an ad-on option.  Other than that, a fantastic product - I bought two!;Fantastic

All the kids say, ""Hey, look at the hoover board""!\nI wear protective gear when riding, but it is amazing how much control you have when you are on the board.  I can move through a crowd at a slow enough speed that is comfortable to those around me.  I've rode it through festival grounds and the reaction by adults and kids is cool.\nIt's best to ride on smooth surfaces, it feels like you are floating over the ground.  I've climb hills with about a 30 degree angle with no power loss and the battery life very good.

I can't keep up with my wife who prefers riding a bike, but the Segway can go long distances with no problem.  I've ridden over rough terrain and grass with no problem.  And the Segway is light enough (28pds) that I can carry it when I need too. It fits in the front seat of my truck and I love it!

However before purchasing I contacted Segway tech support to get their take on this.  What the gentleman told me was that it does not have a hard limit on weight, and that they have had users in excess of 300 lbs ride with good results.  I'm about 230 lbs.\n\nFYI I'm an experienced Segway user, albeit always the models with the handles. In fact I've spent whole days zipping around on various old-style Segway products without any problem or incident.\n\nSo unit ordered and received.  What happened upon my initial ""step up"" was a totally uncontrollable herky-jerkey back and forth as the unit attempted to stabilize with my weight, over compensated and repeated.  Pretty scary stuff.  I was on level ground inside my garage.\n\nFinally after it stopped shaking (and me too!) I was able to gingerly move forward, back, around and such.  I went through the ""training"" routine in the smartphone app, and then ventured out onto my driveway.  The area I chose has a very slight incline (a couple degrees or less) and I attempted to go down, turn around, then go back up.  It wasn't having it.  It started to beep at me, pushed back on my legs and refused to climb.\n\nThere is NO way this compares favorably for me with the admittedly much more expensive Segway riders.\n\nThey need to come out with a Segway ""Midi"" for us larger folks.

I've been hoping to get a hover board for a while and was planed to get one during black Friday, but my husband told me that it's better to get this Segway miniPRO as it is easier to balance and it's the original designer of self balancing board, I'd tried the standard Segway 5 years ago in Disneyworld and I like that, always hope to get a Segway too but sure it's impossible, where can I use such a big Segway?\n\nFinally got this Segway miniPRO on Black Friday.  It's still so pricey to me but with 2 hundred bucks more I sure buy this Segway but not a hover board, at least they have Segway repair centers here in most of the big cities.  So this is my whole family xmas gift this year, and we all can't wait to unbox it.  Since I had experience on riding a standard Segway, it's not hard for me to understand and ride this miniPRO, it runs smooth and really easy to control, was a bit hard to get off the miniPRO in the beginning but after few practices I can master it now.  My 12 yrs old never try on a Segway or hover board and still easy for her to get on it and control it.  Fun for the whole family.  I ride it for approx 10 minutes and my legs and knees are kind of sore now.\n\nI don't have chance to take it outdoor and try yet, it's raining here these two days and the instruction said cannot get it wet.

I enjoy this new experience more  so much fun. Man if this thing could go faster and stop beeping me past 10 mph! Love it nonetheless!\n\nSpeed isn't my problem. Going in and out of my driveway is. Imagine looking at a cross section: the street slightly slopes down where it meets my driveway and then my driveway slopes slightly up and there is this one inch bump up across my driveway at the street/driveway intersection that pose a problem. So that little bump at the bottom of the V causes me to loose control for a millisecond forcing me to lean forward which then accelerated the Segway/driver combo into the back of my truck at good rate of impact. Ouch! Before then I thought this thing lacks acceleration, ha! I was more worry about the Segway than me. The Segway is OK and I got out with a minor bloody knee.

Now you could. The tire right out of the box, 30 psi left, close to 0 psi right. That's a problem, leaks about a pound per day. If it's leaking, it is recommended pump to 60 psi to seat the tire bead then let it down to 45-50 psi. We'll see if that works. Bluetooth pairing just sucks the battery life out of my cell phone like no other devices. Nice tires but just too small to go over any minor bumps like getting into a driveway without a crash landing. Sometimes I make it and other times ended up doing a running dismount, if lucky. Yeah, helmet, wrist and elbow guards and kneepads are a must. I kid you not, else you just buying time. With that said maximum 10 mph just too slow, little kids with skateboards just blow past me. Nice if it could go 17 mph. till back is PIA, wish it had a cruse control at 9.5 mph without the beeps and lean backs. 14-mile range is nice; don't think I'll out grow it till I get in the long trails. Let's say my feet gives up before the batteries. It could go up somewhat steep streets including some in San Francisco, although slower. Segway tech support is pretty good. They answer phones and emails. You cannot self-service this thing without voiding the warranty, like changing the batteries or even changing tires - bummer. Remote control somewhat useless for my needs, I just couldn't control it that well plus it is weak couldn't go straight on carpets, floor tiles or little obstructions would stop it dead on its tracks. Same goes for the somewhat useless alarm; it vibrates, not going to stop from someone stealing it. Won't be able even to notify you if outside of bluetooth distance. It really needs a physical locking mechanism like provision in attaching your provided chain to. Nice bluetooth pairing with cell phone proving info on current speed, miles traveled, remaining miles on battery in real time. Solid machine and much fun. Very easy to learn riding this thing.

62;127.0;5.0;5.0;-209.08730769230763;Heck of a lot of fun, but this device will make life so much easier for my spouse, who suffers from PAD. We put it together last evening and had it out in the driveway. It takes a bit of getting used to when getting on and off - can't seem to find a way to make it hold still while we get on or off.  Needs a parking brake! The starting slow speed is plenty fast - i don't think we need it to go 10 miles an hour.  The dog hates it, but we love it. The wife took it to work today, first time. It will make the parking lot walk for her so much faster and without the typical pain in the legs she suffers.  As long as she doesn't fall off the thing... Kudos for such a useful transportation device!\nA couple months later...\nShe fell off.  Was she doing what she was supposed to be doing with her Segway MiniPro? Oh, no she wasn't! She was dragging a wheeled case behind her.  Did she navigate the wide cracks in the sidewalk as instructed in the practice instructions on her cellphone? Nope.  Flat on her back. Advice to all you who would poo poo the instructions, too - don't. Do do what they tell you, namely, navigate uneven surfaces carefully and don't, for gosh sakes, carry or pull something that will put you off balance.  This thing is great - a godsend for those who cannot walk long distances without serious pain - but can be unforgiving if you should depart from Segway's intended uses and purpose and advice. Do yourself a favor. Heed the practice instructions on your cell's Segway app and continue to do so after they lift the governor on your machine's speed limit. May you never prove me right.;Fun! Useful. Pain reliever. Cute as the dickens!

73;129.0;2.0;5.0;-138.0415517241379;Received item with some damage to shipping boxes  and did not think much of it. However, it should have been a clue I was going to have problems. putting the device together was extremely easy mastering turns and riding extremely simple if you have a sense of balance.  but the application you need to download is a bit touchy and had to load a couple of times before it would work correctly.\n\n after about 20 minutes of use I started hearing metal on metal grinding sound under the foot or shall I say Feet platform  possibly cause buy a drop while being shipped. Ended up returning the item since that was the only option given at the time. tried talking to Amazon about receiving a replacement of the item and they told me they could not do so since it was a third party. I believe it was pretty crappy of them not to be able to send out the replacements at their expense for a prime customer.  needless to say I have cancelled the subscription and will minimize my use of this site Since their quality control and customer service seems to be failing year after year.\nIt was bought on their Prime day at $699.00 AND now if I wanted to buy again it would be at a higher rate. Thanks Amazon for standing behind your customers;Fun but.....
77;130.0;5.0;5.0;-13.712142857142837;I am a 57 years old and 5' tall that have polio on one of my legs. I can walk and have good balance but unable to walk or stand too long due to weak leg muscles. I bought it on the Prime Day and have been using it around the house. At the beginning I set the knee control to the lowest height and felt kind of a bit unstable. Later I set it to the highest and use my inner tights to make the turns and felt a lot more stable. Before this Segway miniPRO, I was considering having a wheelchair but unable to sit too long because it hurts my hip joint. In this case I can stand and able to move freely.;Alternative for wheelchair
82;131.0;4.0;5.0;-111.01365853658534;So, the Segway Minipro ...  Let me start out by stating that I absolutely LOVE this thing!!  I bought one during PrimeDay just for fun, never thinking I would like it so much and actually intended to gift it to my nephew.  So I removed a star due to the speed limiter feature.  As others have pointed out, once unlocked, speed limit is 10.9mph, yet this thing feels like it can go much faster.  Ive ridden it about 35miles (not all at once), since delivery 4days ago.  At first I constantly kept hitting that limit.  Doing so, will cause an annoying beep as well as the minipro will respond by automatically slowing itself you once you do.  But now, with more riding experience, Ive gotten used to riding anywhere from 8-10mph without the repercussions of hitting the safety speed barrier.  So its really more to cruise than to race!\n\nI wanted to address a concern with the App.  It IS possible to connect 1 phone to multiple minipros, as well as 1 minipro to multiple phones.  This means that you CAN sell your unit and some else CAN use their own phone to connect.  Checkout youtuber: MEtv Product Reviews, his videos are quite informative.;Absolutely recommended!
84;132.0;5.0;5.0;11.525000000000006;I'm 15 years old, and used to have a hoverboard. Sadly, I broke my hand while riding down a hill on the hoverboard, and then decided to never touch it again. After showing my parents the amazing features of the segway and how it watches out for you, beeps when you're riding it too fast, and lets you limit your max speed through the app, my parents bought me one! I got it because it's the best of both worlds--both safe and extremely fun to ride! Great product, highly recommend it!;Finally convinced my parents to get me this Segway because of its safety!
91;133.0;5.0;5.0;-33.96299999999995;Most fun I have had in years! Always wanted a Segway but just could not justify the $4-6K expense. This is just the same but has the added benefit of being able to pick it up and put in in my car or take it up a flight of stairs.. cant do that with the big boys! It only goes 10 mph not 12 but it is plenty fast. I had taken a few Segway tours so was familiar with the controls. Had it registered to my phone and flew through the training in only a few minutes. Speed control for the first 1k is so smart! I am sure it has saved a few wrists and knees. I'm 54 and it makes me feel like I am a 20 year old again. Weirdest thing is you don't know what to do with your hands while you ride....;Most fun I have had in years
99;134.0;5.0;5.0;7.461981132075493;I bought this as an impulse buy on Prime Day for myself and my son who is 12 and really loves cool tech. Since I was traveling when it arrived, he easily assembled the four boxes that this came in and off he went! He hasn't put it down since because the learning curve is really short and the FUN factor is off the charts. He has literally been using it every day since we got it.\n\nI get home tomorrow and can only hope that he lets me ride it once in a while or I'll just have to buy another one!;Exceeds all expectations!
107;135.0;4.0;5.0;-351.24636563876646;Okay, I didn't get hover boards.  They seemed cheap, awkward and dangerous.  Frankly, it was the Prime Day price and great Amazon service that prompted me to buy this.  After all, I could always return it.\n\nI get this.\n\nWith average balance, and no particular skills, I was a little leery.  Not paying attention to the instructions, I started using it by myself, inside.  Within 30 seconds, I was up and going.\n\nThis is an astonishing experience.  The knee post practically read my mind.  Swooping, gliding, swirling, turning - it was as if the wheels sprouted from my legs.  It turns on a dime, rolls silently and, so far, is providing the battery life it says it would.\n\nThe lights are neat - head lights come on in the dark, there are automatic turn signals, red tail lights and the app will let you customize. The speed is fine.  You don't really want to go much faster without more protection than you can wear on this.\n\nWhy not five stars?\n\n1. It is heavy.  Yes, you can walk it like a dog, but eventually, you will have to pick it up.  No tossing it into a back pack, either.\n2. Not really self balancing.  It falls over without warning when parked.  And you can't count on just leaning it against something, as it rolls away.  Standing still is not easy.  You won't fall over, but you will move back and forth. Not a problem indoors, but not so good at a light.\n3.. It is expensive.  Okay, not like the $15,000 original Segway, $2500 electric bikes and such, but it is an investment.  Think abut how you will use it before plunking down the money..\n4. No seat.  After thirty minutes or so, you realize you are using muscles you had been ignoring.  I cycle and walk regularly, and still I felt the twang of certain thigh muscles.  This might turn out to be a plus, of course.\n5..  The instructions say not to get it wet. Really?  If this can't go through a puddle, is it really ready for prime time?\n6.  For all the weight and size, there isn't any storage.  This is a minor complaint, but maybe a glove (or charger) box?  Or a place to put a wallet or phone?  I will be strapping the charger on when I take it anywhere farther than a mile or so.\n\nAll in all, this has been fun for my entire family.  We all want to use it - at least indoors - so far. Would I buy a second?  Hmm.  Hard to say.  Might have to wait for the next Prime Day.;Swooping, gliding, spinning - like the wheels sprouted from my legs!
108;136.0;4.0;5.0;-270.36597826086955;I will start by saying I am an over the road driver and there are times where I may either finish my day early or may shut down somewhere cool on the weekend and although I have a bicycle that I keep strapped to my headboard to ride to somewhat keep me in shape, what about those tines where I don't want to get all sweaty and stuff right? This mini pro was my solution of a few other transportation devices.\n\nMy intentions called for 15+mph, portable, under 35lbs, can run at least 12-14miles and is somewhat weather/water resistant. I was downed to a toss up between the m5 push scooter which I was certainly going to buy until this thing popped up.\n\nI have never ridden a hoverboard style device so this is new territory for me. I am 187lbs and is more of a casual driving type of person. This thing is OK to me. Ive  read all the reviews and articles I could find on this mini pro before purchasing and everything seemed pretty legit. For the most part I like everything about it.\n\nTwo things I don't like about it:\n- low top speed\n- the constant interruptions (it leaning back to slow you down) of my riding when approaching or driving the governed speed limit.\n\nI've seen so many complaints about this and I can understand why ninebot did that, but the firmware is too aggressive. The constant notifications telling you about the speed warnings are also pointless and annoying. Couldn't there be an disclaimer that an owner can agree to that will allow them to ride without all of the speed interruptions where if they got hurt while exceeding the intended limits, the rider will be fully reliable? These are the problems I have with it. Battery life seems pretty good as I've driven mine about 4.3miles and still have 73% battery life left (driven along a mostly flat route and I am 187lbs). I drove it in Minnesota 15-18mph winds against the wind and couldn't seem to get it to go over 4-5mph just so y'all know.;Well i recommend you knowing exactly what you want from your device before buying.

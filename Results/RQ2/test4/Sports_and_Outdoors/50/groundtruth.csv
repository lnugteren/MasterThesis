34;1.0;5.0;1030.0;-778.2713636363635;"I've read several reviews here with people being confused or disappointed, but I think perhaps expectations were different. First off, I'm not a trained professional, but I've been exercising for years and I pay close attention to proper form for the most effective effort. I'll try to explain how this works and what to expect.\n\n-- CORE MUSCLES WORKED WITH AN AB WHEEL:\nShoulders, arms,  upper and lower back, abs (all sections)\n\n-- WHAT TO EXPECT ON QUALITY:\nThe quality on these things doesn't have to be fancy - it has a simple use and just has to be functional. Two wheels are better than one, however. The wheels are solid plastic/rubber and the grips are similar. Are the grips terribly comfortable? No, but they're not bad either and you aren't using it for hours at a time -just minutes. Wrap some tennis racquet grip around them for added comfort if you want more, but it's really not needed. This is a basic tool and doesn't need to be made of expensive materials. The bar through the middle is solid metal (not sure if there is a weight limit but I'd guess at about 200lbs).\n\n-- PUTTING IT TOGETHER:\nIt arrives in a box as two separate wheels, a metal bar, two rubber handles and a single sheet of instructions. Place the bar through the wheels and center them as best as you can. Then slide/wiggle/twist one handle all the way onto one end of the bar (I didn't need grease - it went on pretty easily, yet snug). Then try to line up the grip of the other handle and slide that onto the other side of the bar with the wheels in the middle. Push on the ends of the handles to make sure they're on all the way. You will be able to twist the grips a little to line them up perfectly. Putting it together took me only a couple of minutes.\n\n-- USING IT (BASIC):\nUsing the Ab Wheel is simple, but really works the abs if done correctly. This simple devise helps create the line down the middle of your abs for that nice six pack!\n\nKneel on the floor with one hand on each handle and the wheel positioned on the floor, centered before you. Without arching your back (keep it straight and keep your head straight too - don't look up or drop your head down) slowly roll the wheel away from your knees in a straight line before you. Your body moves forward with the wheel, away from your knees - this is KEY to making this move effective! Your weight is supported via your hands on the bar and by your knees (and a straight back). The further you can stretch your arms out before you and the further you can lean away from your knees the more you will work the core muscles in your abs. When you've rolled out as far as you safely can, reverse and roll back up to the starting position (this should be hard!). Line your body up facing a wall (knees 2-3 ft from the wall) and roll out toward the wall if you want something there to help you stop rolling. Line up further and further away as you get stronger.\n\nYou may not be able roll out more than 2-3 feet at first but that's okay. (When I stop my abs/hips are about 10-12 inches from the floor. You want to aim for about a 45 degree angle from your knees to your hips and then a countering 45 degree angle from your hands on the ab wheel to your shoulders. Think of making a bridge with your body where your knees are one support on one side of the water and the wheel is the other support on the other side of the river/body of water. Again, the farther you can stretch out, the more difficult the workout, but be careful and don't push too hard too fast or you'll tear something! Use your head and be conservative at first.\n\nBeginners should probably start with 1-2 sets of 5-10 reps and work on rolling out further as you become stronger. I'm trying 2 sets of 10 reps and my abs are SORE after 2 days of this!! :)\n\nIt's IMPORTANT TO KEEP YOUR BACK STRAIGHT and to not arch it as you roll out. You can hurt yourself if you do this move incorrectly. The wheel comes with some basic instructions that show you the proper form. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!\n\n-- USING IT (ADVANCED):\nOnce you get comfortable using it as described above, add a twist and rather than just rolling straight ahead of you, keep your knees still and roll out at about a 25-30 degree angle left or right of center, twisting at the waist. This will really focus on the oblique muscles. I'd suggest alternating each direction during your reps, but that's just my opinion. ;)\n\nThis really is a GREAT ab workout and you WILL feel it if done properly. Good luck on that six pack!";Build that six-pack!
4;2.0;3.0;5.0;41.59800000000004;Don't be a sucker and pay $30.00 for this cheap piece of plastic. It's okay, but the cheap plastic wheels don't provide very good traction on a hard surface...rubber tread, like on a car tire would be much better. There's so many premium ab wheels out there that can be had for way cheaper...cheaper than this Valeo and better. This thing shouldn't cost more than 13 bucks.;30 bucks for this ab wheel is robbery!
23;3.0;5.0;217.0;-1195.9259186864738;"Let me start this off with my conclusion--the Valeo Ab Wheel is fantastic and a great value for the paltry amount of money you will spend on it.\n\nI've been eating well and exercising (light weights, a couple sets of pull-ups/chin-ups and resistance cables) five to ten minutes a day--along with 1-1.5 hours of cardio once or twice a week--but wanted a little more strength and definition in my core.  I started doing sit-ups once or twice a day--50-100 at a time--which felt pretty good but I was worried about not working all of my abs equally.  I was also curious as to other methods because my back or shoulders seem to click when I do full sit-ups.  Additionally, it was hard to anchor myself unless I put my feet under the bottom edge of the couch, which involved putting shoes on due to the sharp wooden frame.  All in all, it was a bit of a production just to do some sit-ups.\n\nI found the Valeo Ab Wheel on Amazon and ordered it based on the other reviews, and the fact that it seemed such a simple solution compared to my sit-up/crunches ritual.  It is a pleasure to use, but make SURE that you read the instructions on proper use so that you do not hurt your back.  Keep it STRAIGHT through the whole repetition.  I recommend using the Ab Wheel on carpet for the added friction--it helps you control how far you extend yourself and prevent self-injury--but it will operate smoothly on a solid floor.  I keep the wheel right next to my bed so that one of the first things I do when I get up (other than kill the alarm) is to do a set.  I start my coffee, have a banana, and then do another set when I come back into the bedroom to get my clothes before showering.  If I'm feeling particularly adventurous that day, I'll do a third set of 15 in the evening before dinner.\n\nThe first time I used it, I was able to do two sets of 15 a couple minutes apart, but my abs were SORE afterwards--the awesome kind of sore that lets you know you've had a good workout.  Before I used it the first time I was pretty sure I'd be able to do a good number because I've practiced martial arts--which is all about core strength--for 15 years.  DO NOT be discouraged if at first you can only do a couple at a time!  I could only do two or three proper pull-ups or chin-ups on a chin-up bar when I started a year ago.  I added one or two more reps to each set every couple weeks. Now I am up doing two to three sets of 14-20 pull-ups or chin-ups every few days, just from casual consistency.  You can do the same with the Valeo Ab Wheel.\n\nAfter using the ab wheel for a little over a month, I now comfortably do 2-3 sets of 15 every day (giving the muscles a day to rest and heal if they start to get sore).  This ab wheel is well-constructed and sturdy for someone who is 5'6 and 145lbs like me, and it does give your back and arms (triceps and forearms) a little bit of a workout, too!\n\nIn six weeks of ownership and regular use, I have seen results in terms of better abdominal definition.  My girlfriend compliments me constantly, putting her hands on my chest just to touch--which is pretty awesome considering she is also in great shape.  In her words I now ""have abs that are sculpted like on a greek statue"".  To be honest, I haven't worked that hard at being in good shape, I've simply been consistent and made it a lifestyle change.  Eating well--a good amount of protein and healthy fats from nuts, eggs, fish, chicken, and oils (walnut and grapeseed oils taste great and have Omega-3s to keep your brain in good order!) along with salads, coarse grains, a variety of fruit and green vegetables, a limited amount of red meat, sweets, and bread/baked products, and lots of water, tea, and coffee (black or with a small amount of soy creamer) along with decent sleep--is probably two thirds of it.\n\nI've found that the process of simply learning about how healthy all of these things are for your mind and body--and how bad trans fats and junk/fast/frozen-prepared food is for it--goes a long way in causing your body and mind to literally CRAVE the things that are most healthy for you.  I see ice cream, steak, chips, or cake at a party and sure, I'll have a little, but you know you're in a good place when you are at home and actually crave carrots/broccoli and low fat hummus, walnuts, and an apple!  Eating these things feels GOOD because you know how good they are for you--it seems to be about conditioning your mind and body to desire these things through the education of both.\n\nThe last bit of it has been working out in the privacy of my own apartment about 5-10 minutes every day and at the dojo for an hour or so a couple times a week, then going for walks for photography, grocery runs, or just to get out and enjoy the good weather.  I was bicycling 13 miles on a flat urban trail near my place 2-3 times a week (which took me about 50 minutes total) but I haven't done that since last summer.  I'll start up again now that the weather is good, but it hasn't been part of my routine for months.  I have lost about 25lbs in one year (more than that if you count conversion of fat to muscle) and I've gone from being in OK shape with a few extra pounds to being super-proud of how I look.  I'm not ripped, just really toned and with a healthy and sustainable amount of muscle in the right places--""like a perfect male model for sketching"", according to the artistic girlfriend.\n\nNow I regularly get compliments from friends, clients, and strangers--something I am totally unused to.  I've never thought of myself as hot or especially attractive, but apparently I've been seeing myself incorrectly for some time now.  These days, I dress nicer and I am not afraid to wear more flattering clothes.  I am so much more confident in myself, personally, professionally, and physically.  It has really helped me become more outgoing and willing to try new things and meet new people simply for the sake of meeting new people.\n\nI'm not going to claim that the Ab Wheel is responsible for all of this--I've only had it a little over a month.  However, in my short time with it, it has proven to be yet another useful, effective, and affordable tool in becoming who I want to be. It has become and will continue to be a regular part of my workout.  I wanted to share my experience with all of you and hopefully my story will help(along with the Valeo Ab Wheel) inspire you to become the healthy and happy person I know you can be.  There is no reason why you should not buy this product, save for already owning one.  You owe it to yourself and the value you will get out of this--directly and indirectly--immeasurably exceeds the $15 you'll pay for it.\n\nMatt";Effective and Affordable
41;4.0;4.0;152.0;27.287500000000023;The ab wheel is very well made and contrary to what others have said, if you take the time to snug the grips up tight, the wheels do not wobble at all.  As for the workout, it's extremely difficult, but also extremely effective.  10 reps and you feel a burn that lasts for two days!  After using 3 times a week for the last three weeks, I've noticed a great difference in the tighness in my abs.  Recommended.;Extremely Effective
25;5.0;5.0;98.0;-81.08840659340657;I bought this little ab wheel almost 18 months ago, and have used it three times a week ever since. At the time, I had a lower back pain on and off since giving birth to my son 6 years ago and crunches and sit-ups made the pain worse.\nAt first it was difficult to even finish 20 reps at one sitting, but now 100 reps are my norm. Along with a regular cardio exercise (I run 6 miles on a treadmill three times a week), this little wheel worked wonders on my abdominal area without causing any back pain. It helped reduce my waistline from 31 inches to 26 inches, and I have a nice six-pack to show off to my hubby (which is saying a lot for a 40 year old woman)! Because it is so light-weight, I even bring this wheel to the vacations. I would say it was the best spent $12 in my memory! Just don't forget, this is not a magic device - as is true with any exercise regimen, persistence is the key. Happy exercise!;Worked wonders!
10;6.0;1.0;37.0;-21.868536585365817;You would think it would be a simple enough thing to assemble this thing. Be careful!!!  You have to remove a bar end cover to thread the wheels through, well the raw metal ends of the bar are incredibley unfinished and sharper than a Razer. When threading the 2 wheels together through the holes, the bar slipped through hitting the palm of my hand and removed a large chunk of skin. It hurt like you would not believe and after 5 hours was still bleeding. Finally this morning it stopped bleeding.\nNow my father's day has been ruined because of cheeply made crap. This is a total piece of garbage and should not be sold on Amazon or anywhere for that matter.;Ends of the bar is like a Razer blade
9;7.0;5.0;21.0;-56.821476510067086;I ordered this ab wheel to add to my daily rotation of exercises. I have been using this product twice a day for the last 4 months.\n\nPros:\n-Durability, even after extensive use, there is no structural or aesthetic damage to the ab wheel\n-Function, it was easy to assemble and rolls smoothly day in and day out\n\nCons:\n-Comfort, after using the product for a week, my hands developed small blisters that I am guessing are from the hand grips. They are plastic and can cause discomfort with extended use. I simply wrapped the hand grips in some tape and have not had any issues since.\n\nOverall:\nI am extremely pleased with this product, especially given the relatively low price point. It has lasted daily use for 4 months with no signs of breaking anytime soon. I could not have been happier with this purchase.;Awesome little ab shredder

I don't know that 2 wheels makes it better, but it does the job.\n\nOnly gripe was that it was almost impossible to put the foam handle on over the metal bar, that was a workout by itself, had to use all knowledge of physics and all brute strength in fingers to get job done.;nice
33;9.0;5.0;52.0;-95.06221674876844;"I bought this product with a lot of skepticism -- it's made of plastic, it's $10, and it's a wheel that's somehow supposed to work your abs. But reviews from other people were good and the price is unbeatable, so I just figured what the hell.\n\nAnd guess what, this is now one of my favorite exercises and a staple in my at-home routine (which also consists of the Perfect Pushup and the Iron Gym). Using this ab wheel you get a great stretch and it'll make your lower back, abs, lats, shoulders and arms work for their money. I'm a web developer, so my job is sitting in front of the computer for 10, 12, 16 hours a day, and I've developed a bunch of problems with posture and general joint irritation, but I firmly believe that this has helped me out.\n\nAlso my girlfriend off the cuff said ""Are you still doing that ab wheel thing every night? I can tell"". That's a nice thing to hear :)\n\nAnyway, you've got nothing to lose for something this cheap, and I haven't broken the thing yet, so give it a shot!";Great!

It serves its purpose though, I guess.\n\nThe workout it provides is pretty good. Got this thing today, did a few sets with it, and can definitely feel it in my abs, though you have to watch your form carefully as it's easy to arch your back.\n\nWorks the shoulders and arms pretty hard, too.";Pretty Good Workout
35;11.0;5.0;32.0;-127.93275109170303;Best exercise for tighter abs. Using it for 4 weeks now and definitely seeing the improvement in my abs.\n\nEase of Install: Very easy & quick. Don't know why other reviewers said it is difficult. Maybe there was some problem years ago. The instructions ask to use some oil on the steel rod before slipping on the handles.\n\nPosture: Make sure you are using it in right posture per the instructions provided on the small paper inside the box. This is very necessary if you want to see an impact. Pay attention to the DOs & DONTs. I wish Valeo had provided these instructions on a bigger size paper & in a more readable text size & font.\n\nExercise: The key is to stop for a second or two in fully stretched posture in order to work the abs. It might be difficult initially, but you will surely get there in a week or two.\n\nMythbuster: Using ab-wheel only will not result in a 6 pack or flat abs as seen on the models on the box. You need to do cardio to burn the fat. Ab-wheel will work on the abs internally and make them tight. One health coach told me that your abs become visible when your BMI is less than 8%. I am not there yet, but working on it. Hope you get there soon.;Definitely works, be patient & do it right

Then it went on pretty good.\n\nOtherwise, it's working great, i've lost about 8 lbs in a week and a half from it, I've changed my eating habits a little bit, but ot a lot. I still drink coke and 151 every night, and have snacks. i just added salad to dinners, which we bar-b-que, and drink more water during the day. The first time i used it i was sore for days, probably because i did it for 15 minutes.

Be sure you exercise as directed since is really easy hurt yourself doing this. Another thing is that you have to be in good shape to begin working out with this or any other wheel. The grip is pretty bad, I have to use my gloves every time because if I don't my hands get really soar.;Just OK product.... The grip is pretty bad though
5;14.0;5.0;8.0;-158.58499999999998;Took two minutes to assemble, and was ab rolling for another 2 minutes before having to take a break. Ha. No bells and whistles, but fits the bill perfectly. I didn't want to spend too much for something so simple but also didn't want it to be so flimsy, Id never really use it.\n\nThis is my first ab wheel, and am a pretty active guy. I saw some more expensive wheels that had cushioned handles/spring technology, but felt that would take away from the effectiveness of the workout. I feel like this workout is just right, and comfortable enough to pull it out and crank out a few sets before bed or in between primary workouts. The handles feel similar to bicycle handlebars, which is fine what I expected. The wheel doesnt leave any black marks or anything on carpet and I feel like itll last awhile. Ive had it for about 6 months now and its still in like new condition with almost daily use. Would buy again if I lost this one.\n\nNOTE: If you're a veteran, id pause for a second or two each time you roll out. If you're not, and want to make it a little easier not to pull a muscle, you could put some weights in front of the wheel so it doesnt roll all the way out. I do both depending on the day. Ha.\n\nI paid full price for this and am reviewing this product solely for the benefit of future buyers.;Two Minute Assembly...Two Minute Workout...Done! Perfect!

Well, therein lies the problem.. if you are just zipping back and forth on it, you are not using it right and you will not have the results that it can actually give.\n\nMy hubby is 6'4 and in great shape, exercises regularly, lifts weights, etc. He benches 200 & 300 lbs. He did not expect this little wheel to be so much work for him. He is by no means a weakling, but this Ab Wheel definitely takes some strength to use properly. He loves it though. He can ""feel the burn"" after just a few tries and keeps using it daily getting a few more in, each day.\n\nWhen he showed me how to use it, I was like this is cake, I'm just rolling back and forth and it took no strength and I felt no difficulty. I WASN'T USING THE PROPER FORM AND MUSCLES! Once he got me to do it right, boy was there a major difference! I can see and feel how this thing works, when used properly. Doing it right is essential. If you are just rolling back and forth, then you are not doing it right and you will not see any results.\n\nIt seems sturdy enough and the grips are pretty comfortable.\n\nThis little device is definitely worth trying, but remember to make sure you are doing it the right way.";Works great IF YOU USE IT CORRECTLY

Nothing complicated about the device and there isn't anything in particular that's needed from such a device.\n\nI did notice the price recently was $16 and higher and if it is that price when you're thinking of buying it, there are cheaper options out there or you can wait for the price to go back down. I bought it for about $9-10 from here and that's reasonable for such a device. Like I mentioned above, it is a highly simplistic device and paying over $10 for it seems unnecessary.\n\nReminder: if you have weak or injured wrists then you may not want to jump up to this device yet as you will be supporting your weight the entire time and your wrists will not be happy if they have a pre-existing condition or are not ready for it. Example: if being in the high plank/push-up position hurts your wrists then using this device properly will make them even less happy.

Great for me, since after a rough pregnancy I can't even do one situp!;great!
15;28.0;5.0;8.0;-211.93398058252424;What I love about the ab wheel is how quickly you feel the burn.  I've been an Abslide user on and off since I was 12 years old (I've re-bought probably 5 Abslides over the years) but recently I just wasn't feeling the burn as quickly as I used to.  I did some googling and realized that the spring mechanism in the Abslide makes the exercise too easy, and that a basic ab wheel requires more work from the user and thus will produce better results.  I searched for an ab wheel and came across the Valeo Ab Wheel for an awesome price on Amazon.  The device itself is small and basic and easy to travel with.  The first time I used it it fatigued my arms too quickly for me to feel it in my abs.  I did some push-ups and tried another round on the ab wheel and this time I REALLY felt it in my abs.  I was sore for a full 2 days afterward on my entire upper body.\n\nI am now hooked on this little device which delivers an incredibly efficient workout in a very short time.  I like combining 10-15 reps on the ab wheel with 10-15 push-ups as the combination of these two exercises really targets the upper body (particularly the backs of the arms) and abs.  I would especially recommend doing this if the ab wheel fatigues your arms more quickly than your abs so you can still get an efficient ab workout.  I have replaced much of my upper body and ab work with this device and am looking and feeling lean.  For females especially (like myself) who like to have a lean upper body but can bulk up too much from weight lifting, this device will help keep your arms toned and your abs defined.;VERY Efficient Upper Body/Ab Workout
13;29.0;1.0;7.0;47.91323529411766;I got it at the end of December with one missing handle. And recently received replace one with one damaged handle. Fortunately, two handles from two shipment can combined together to make it works.;poor product
36;30.0;5.0;9.0;-82.08499999999997;Someone told me about the Torso Track II. When I went looking for it, I couldn't find it anywhere, besides...ugh...ebay. I started wondering if there was a reason they cannot be found anymore, but have yet to find one. However, while looking, I stumbled across this magnificent ab wheel! 1/10 of the price and does the same job. Many people had issues with the handles not fitting, but I read the reviews before I purchased it. And, therefore, had absolutely no problem with that.\n\nIf you aren't working your back and arms, start off doing a few a day and work up to more.\n\nPay attention to your balance. I recommend using it against a wall or other sturdy object, to prevent you from going to far and straining yourself or falling over.\n\nAlso, make sure to use your lower back, do not let it dip or you will wind up hurting yourself.\n\nI starting using this for lower back problems, which have gone away almost completely. Even my chiropractor approves!;Great product, Even better price
37;31.0;5.0;9.0;8.04500000000003;This is great simple product at a cheap price, it is sturdy.\nSome of the people gave it a bad review because they said it is hard to get the handles on but if the would have bothered to read the first line of the directions they would have read the company recommends you use a little lotion or soap, I used a skirt of lotion on the bar before slipping the handles on.  It took me about 5 seconds to fully assemble and the handles does not slip off as my son has also been driving it all around.;Awesome read if you also read the 1 and 2 stars
17;32.0;5.0;6.0;-52.05651898734173;"I bought this product because my back has too many problems for sit ups, and I'm pretty sure I was never doing them right in the first place. When the product arrived, I put it together in a minute or two (it's very easily assembled) and got on the floor to give it a try. After reading the ""operation instructions,""  I felt they were poorly written and had no idea exactly what I was supposed to do. A quick youtube search showed me videos of exercises, and I was off. Less than 5 minutes later, I was a sobbing mess lying in the fetal position on the floor. I know this product works because it sets my abs on fire and makes me sore for days. It's cheaper than any other product that's supposed to do the same thing, so what's not to like? Buy it. Use it. Hate it. Keep using it.";Love/Hate relationship
27;33.0;3.0;7.0;-57.85285714285712;This product is a cheap and easy way to get a GREAT core workout.\nReally beats your abs into shape. Or it would if I kept using it.\n\nOk, so it's been a while since I've watched any of the Lethal Weapon movies, but remember Martin Rigg's shoulder would always crap out on him in every movie? Yeah that's kinda what happened to me after using it for 2.5 weeks. I would slam my shoulder against walls and pillars because it hurt so much, and I would call my wife and cuss her out over the phone because the pain made me go crazy.\n\nI'm guessing the human shoulder isn't meant to handle that kind of weight and stress.\n\nI have no doubts about the effectiveness of this product though.\nBut perhaps it's not for everyone. I would highly recommend it to anyone who has strong shoulders.\nI can not wait for the next Mel Gibson movie.;Great workout, but I turned into Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon
20;34.0;5.0;6.0;-44.64071428571427;This is really all anyone needs to get a tremendous core workout doing wheel-rollouts. The Valeo is 'no-brainer' constructed, so I expect it'll last a long time. I had a single wheel version once and it wasn't as stable or comfortable as this. I can't see needing or wanting anything fancier (and overpriced).\n\nOnly thing to be aware of is you should work on a hard, durable surface. Don't work out directly on a hardwood floor, etc. You are putting most of your bodyweight on a wheel with a contact area of about an inch, so the tread pattern may leave marks on a sensitive surface. If nothing else, buy a 1X or 2x12 long hard-wood board and lay it down on your floor and do rollouts on that. Thin, secure carpeting is also good.;Works Great - stable and durable
30;35.0;5.0;7.0;-97.80780487804874;"I am actually one of the many people that advocate hardwork opposed to ""shortcut"" methods.  But I am also open minded to newer techniques that give more OPTIMUM workout.\n\nAny ab workout item that actually works is rare... and one that works at THIS price range is nothing short of a miracle.  This thing actually works.  Feels like doing pullups and crunches at the same time without as much effort.  I do over 100 situps plus other gym ab workouts and just a few rolls on this baby, I can already feel the burns AND in areas I never knew I had. It got my whole upper body sore the next morning with just a few rolls!  Amazing stuff.\n\nA couple things I should mention.. The first time I could barely do 5 of these.  But now I can do 25 with no problem.  Something this product made me realize is how weak my wrists were.  It worked out my whole arm including the wrist which was a major plus.  The handle could be softer... it is plastic so it will take time to get used to.\n\nHandles my weight which is 185 lb.  I'll update this review later if needed.";IT WORKS
21;36.0;1.0;6.0;-5.408712871287108;"Fairly cheap construction. At 6'2"" and 230lbs the wheel did support my weight just fine, but you can just feel how cheap this product is. Thin aluminum axle, cheap plastic-y grips, wheel is too thin and provides almost no stability. I could barely use this product.\n\nIt would have been nice if specific attention had been called to properly assembling the unit, as I didn't get the grips lined up perfectly and they're practically impossible to adjust once you've put them on.\n\nSkip this product, there are wayyyy better options for a good ab workout.";Cheap and disappointing
22;37.0;4.0;6.0;-153.7624124513618;I've been using it for a couple weeks now, and I'm happy I got it.  The wheels are sturdy and the whole thing feels pretty solid and stable even when I have my weight on it.  It rolls nice and smooth.  I didn't have any trouble getting the grips on, as others have described.  They went on pretty easy and they stay on pretty well.  The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that the grips are not as comfortable as they could be.  The first time I used it, I put my lifting gloves back on after a few reps.  With the gloves on, its perfectly fine but it might be an issue if you don't lift with gloves.\n\nNow, ab wheels in general are a great core exercise.  You can really feel it, and it will give you a six pack if you use it consistently.  The catch is that it's a difficult exercise to perform.  If you work out on a regular basis (at least 2-3 times per week) I would say give it a shot.  Concentrate on good form (plenty of explanatory videos online) and don't overdo it.  If you are just starting out, I would suggest concentrating on doing other abdominal exercises first.  My suggestion would be to create an ab routine that takes 10-15 minutes to complete and do it 4 times per week.  Once you build up a base level of core strength you can graduate to the ab wheel.;A great tool, but not for beginners
38;38.0;5.0;7.0;-17.994409448818885;I have other Valeo products so I chose this brand because they make good products.\nI used this for the first time yesterday and boy oh boy do I feel it today.\nAbs, obliques, shoulders and arms. I think this will be a great addition to my home work out collection.\nThis is NOT a magic product that will give you a gym body by itself. I work out at a gym 5 days a week and watch what I eat and will use this to enhance and challenge myself.\nMy home gym gadgets are to supplement my work outs not replace them, so if you want to spice up your work out, then this is your item.\nIt's sturdy and assembles in 5 seconds.\nA+++++;Excellent product and price!
19;39.0;1.0;5.0;34.11857142857144;According to the instructions, this product can be used to tone the abs.  There are several videos on the internet showing fitness instructors demonstrating how to use the wheel.  I never could get coordinated enough to use it.  I'm not saying it doesn't work.  Just that I was not able to push and pull it as smoothly as it is advertised.;Couldn't get the hang of it
39;40.0;5.0;7.0;48.73409090909094;Works great. The dual wheels add a little extra stability. As far as other reviews griping about the difficulty in putting the handles on, its no bid deal.

28;42.0;5.0;5.0;-405.7381999999999;"First, I read the review complaining about the grip and ""difficult assembly"" and have to say they are blatantly wrong.\n\nThe grip is perfect, unless you have massive or extremely petite hands, otherwise you are golden!  It is plastic, however it is NOT slick, even when your hands perspire the grip remains non-slip.\n\nAssembly has A BREEZE.  Two wheels two grips and one sturdy metal rod/axel.  Place the wheels on together and slide the grips on to cap both ends of the rod... that's it...\n\nTo keep this process simple and easy there are tiny holds on the ends of each grip which allows air to escape, so that they slide on with minimal force, i.e. if you have ""trouble"" putting this product together, you are not going to be able to perform the workout this item provides...\n\nSeriously, I've had more difficulty opening 2 liter bottles of soda than were presented by assembly...\n\nThe workout provided by the wheel is ridiculous, but amazing.  @ 220 and 12% body fat I thought I would do ""OK"" when starting out (as I have never worked out with this apparatus before), but I IMMEDIATELY felt the workout and was sore within 10-15 minutes.\n\nThe motion does take a little time to perfect, and it is in your best interest to read directions and take your time to get used to it and believe me you will NOT be able to just take it out of the box and do 20 reps anyway, this thing is a SERIOUS workout.\n\nI considered myself to have a pretty darn strong core, but after my first time, I was shocked to FEEL how much work I had to do.  This is clearly a device intended for those who are already at a tremendous level of fitness.\n\nHOWEVER, if you are able to overcome the initial difficulties and embrace the challenge of this piece of equipment over time you will find no better way to strengthen your core, which is the best way to jump start a better overall fitness and more importantly feel better about yourself and all future workout endeavors.\n\nBuy this item, keep your chin up and stick it out once you see how challenging it is and you will reap serious benefits.\n\nAnyone who gave negative reviews were presumably unable to get over that hump and like most people blame everyone and everything but themselves.\n\nAs someone who is in the midst of a 100lbs + weight loss, I've learned that diet and exercise begins and ends with discipline, some people have it some people don't, if you know you have it, get this thing work your butt off and feel great as a result.  If you are the type looking for an 'easy solution' or think this is just another in a long line of crappy fads, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nThis thing is awesome!!!";Great product without flaws, but it is one difficult workout!

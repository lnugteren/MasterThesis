1;1.0;4.0;101.0;-152.11649805447468;"This bag will work just fine for what I wanted it for. I read many reviews before purchasing and I'd like to clarify things I still had questions/concerns about. This is not an ""extra large"" bag. But the demensions don't lie. It is what they say they are. I don't have an extra large bible that I needed to fit in it, and my standard size bible fits perfectly. Because I don't have an extra large bible and because I'm not using this case as a jacket cover for my bible, (I wanted more of a carrying cas) I can use the flaps as pockets for my notebooks and devotion book, as well as tucking my bible in the other side. There are 2 holders to keep pens as well. I even through my small clip board in there which I keep all of my church's weekly bulletins. Zipped it all up and have everything I need for church or bible study all in one case. Exactly what I was looking for. I didn't give 5 stars because I do find the quality of the case to be a little ""plastic"" like, but not enough to return it or not use it. (And..it was really inexpensive) and I also think the design of the zipper is poor and it's hard to get started when you're ready to close. All things considered, I would definitely recommend this item to keep you organized and ready for your study!";This bag will work just fine for what I wanted it for
8;2.0;4.0;49.0;25.76318181818185;I do appreciate the warm rich color and texture of this bible cover.  I expect the quality workmanship will hold up for a number of years to comes.  Perhaps the only thing missing is an outside pocket on either side that would make it easier to slide in notes,  etc. rather than opening up the entire case when on the run.\n\nDefinetly worth the cost.;Bible cover
10;3.0;5.0;48.0;38.28558823529413;Love Love, this Bible cover.  The ladies at church were wanting to know where I got it......My favorite feature is, I can close and not worry about zipping....I used the fob and attached it to the zipper to make it much easier to zip up...  My other cover had the handle in the binder edge...not good..... Nice and roomy....Couldn't ask for anything more...;Beautiful

Amazon lists this product as 11.2 x 7.6 x 3 inches.  But it will only hold a Bible up to 9.75 inches high by approx 7 inches wide.  Not sure why they call this an ""Extra Large.""  It is only a large ... and barely that.  There is a tag attached to the case when you receive it that gives the actual max Bible size and it is nowhere near the product size.  That all said, it is a fine looking purse-style case that my wife loves (she is using it for a smaller Bible) and appears to be very well made.  Now I am on the hunt for a case that will hold her 11 x 7.5 x 2 inch KJV Super Extra Large Print Study Bible.";it is a fine looking purse-style case that my wife loves (she is ...

This is not a bad thing though because if it gets dirty, it can be easily cleaned with disinfecting wipes and not ruin the material. Fits my bible perfectly. Wish it had an accordion pocket inside to hold a note book or flyers. Great item for the cost and I believe it will hold up to the amount of use it will get.";It is a nice looking case

5;8.0;4.0;11.0;40.78389610389614;Just received the bible cover and it is beautiful. One problem, in the product description it's dimensions are listed as 13.5 x 9.6 x 3.9 inches. It's actually 11.5x7.5x3 inches. I'm keeping it because I have enough women in my family that one of them will use it. But, I have to find one that has the listed dimensions. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars.;Just received the bible cover and it is beautiful. One problem

144;1.0;5.0;1016.0;-157.91448275862064;"I also bought this to scan slides -- however, while the slides are the standard slide size in terms of the holder, the slide film itself is square instead of rectangular like most modern slides (mine are about 1.44"" x 1.44""). For some reason, the default size of the cropping the 8800F uses when you select 35mm slides is not user-changeable. I wrote the company and got a standard answer back that basically said ""we're not changing the software to make you happy"". I think they misunderstood me, but whatever...\n\nFortunately, I found the answer quite by accident. It turns out that in order to make the scanner work for my situation (and maybe yours), I simply had to uncheck the ""Switches On/Off the Thumbnails View Mode"" button and that allowed me to manually create the right size crops. It also means I can use the 35mm strip holder instead of the 35mm slide holder and leave the old slides in their metal slide magazine holders, saving me even more time.\n\nAfter figuring that out, I'm happy to say this scanner exceeds my expectations and makes me a happy camper now that I can no longer use my Konica Dimage Scan Dual IV with my Vista-based PC. The hardware is very sturdy and speed is great. 1200 DPI scans take less than a minute each.\n\nIf you want more information on how to manually set-up to scan older slides, leave me your email as a comment to this review.\n\nHope that helps.\nSteve";High quality - scans and hardware
116;2.0;5.0;506.0;-772.3050471698112;"OUT OF THE BOX: The complete machine is much smaller and lighter than my previous scanner, with the same scan field dimensions. It comes with a USB connection and a separate power ""brick"" between wall socket and scanner. Three scan guides are included; a combo of 2 side-by-side 35 mm film strips (for 5 frames each) with latches that flatten curved strips, a guide for 4 standard size slides and a 120mm film strip holder. These guides fit into a specific place on the scan surface, so that they line up under the lid-mounted light source, which is covered by a removable shield. The lid is quite light, but it needs opening to almost straight up for it stay open without support. The thin latches on the 35mm film strip guide are very flimsy, and I already snapped one when trying to load curved negative strips. Software with scanner drivers etc., an advanced image editing program, as well as versions of Adobe Photoshop Elements (5.0 for windows, 4.0 for mac) are included.\n\nSOFTWARE: I haven't tried all the included software yet, as I prefer to work in other programs for archiving and retouching images. Having said that, using one of the programs to drive the scanner (MP Navigator) I think that there are some unnecessary steps and windows between scanning and saving. Working from a mac, setup was easy and scanning using the scanner interface is very intuitive. Everything runs relatively smooth, but there are occasional software crashes, and I cannot queue a lot of images before the program's buffer is full (even with an excess of RAM). Automatic detection of the images within slide frames or negative strips is very accurate, but this can be switched off, as another reviewer noted, and you can select your own area of interest or a whole film-strip.\n\nSETTINGS: There are numerous choices to make before you scan, such as Unsharp Mask and Remove Dirt & Scratches, which has different levels to choose from, as do ""Grain Correction"" and ""Backlight Correction"". While I generally see a beneficial effect of the Unsharp Mask (again; I work at high dpi settings), I notice that turning the dirt and scratch removal on only makes a mess of the affected areas, while leaving some specs or smudges completely untouched. I tend to turn the choices for removal of dirt & scratches and grain correction completely off. I am running the scanner completely from the scanner software and am not using the panel of buttons on the scanner lid, but it appears that these can be user-configured. Hidden in the preferences is also a setting to enable 48/16 bit output, but I haven't played with that yet.\n\nRESOLUTION: As noted by other reviewers, at higher resolution settings scanning can take quite some time, but I actually like this when it gets to a point of 30 minutes (for example for 8 negatives at 3200 dpi), so that I can work on something else instead of tending to the scanner every few minutes. For a preview scan and scanning prints at lower dpi settings this scanner is reasonably fast.\n\nFILE FORMAT & COMPRESSION: When I was running my initial tests to figure out optimal settings (optimal between image resolution needed and memory demand desired) I ran into some unexpected findings. For instance, I see a dramatic improvement in retention of details when I save scanned images as JPEG format rather than in full size TIFF. The compression actually seems to greatly improve contrast and sharpness, while taking up a lot less space! There are 3 levels of JPEG quality; High, Standard and Low (with inverse amounts of compression), but so far I have not noticed any (!) difference in final details when I choose ""standard"" over ""high"" quality, and again; the files take up less space in standard setting. A clear difference may be seen at lower dpi settings.\n\nRESULTS: The proof of any scanner is in the final scanned image and judging by that standard this CanoScan performs really well.  Scanned prints are easy, because their physical dimensions don't require a high dpi setting. For color or negative film, some colors come out perfect, while others need a little tweaking afterwards, but overall this scanner performs great. I have posted a few images of color slides scanned with the CanoScan 8800F where I compare certain scan or save settings.\n\nIN SHORT:\nPros: High quality scanner with lots of professional options for a low price. Abundant choices in resolution and other settings. Produces amazingly detailed images from prints, negatives and slides.\nCons: Mostly related to software (only tested on a mac); small buffer for scanned images, occasional software crashes, some needles clutter in amount of windows and pop-ups (some, but not all can be turned off). Flimsy latches for 35mm filmstrip guide.\n\nIn spite of some software shortcomings the end results are fantastic for a scanner at this price, and I rate this scanner around four-and-a-half stars.\n\nThis is a review of the Canon CanoScan 8800F.";EXTRAORDINARY!
138;3.0;5.0;428.0;-39.944999999999965;After enjoying my now old Epson Perfection 1650, I was assigned the family's task of scanning our old family slides.  I first tried the dedicated slide scanner available at Hammacher Schlemmer.  What a piece of c***!  After researching dedicated slide scanners for a while, I came upon a review of the Canon 8800F.  After further research (I think I reached the end of the Internet during this effort) I ordered one. Now, after having scanned about 500 old slides, and getting used to the new software interface, I'm in love with this scanner.  It does a GREAT job scanning the old slides in super-high resolution (4800 dpi) and is also an excellent general purpose scanner.  Just a footnote, it takes about 20 minutes to scan four slides at 4800 dpi.;Grandpa loves his new scanner!
1;4.0;5.0;439.0;-61.66810344827584;Bought this scanner to replace my 8400F that I bought two years ago.  The price at $199.00 is about $130.00 less han the 8400F was.\n  First thing that I noticed was the lack of the 8400F's warm-up time for each scan- due to the new lamp Canon now uses.  Yes the scans are sharper- significantly so.\n  The 8800F now is more intuitive to operate due to the new array of seven pushbuttons that select modes.  The off/on switch is now on the top\nlid rather than hidden way back on the left side at table level.\n  On the minus side, there are fewer slide/negative holders to work with.  Canon supplies one for 35mm film and one for 120 film only.\n  Since the name of the game is sharpness and the ability to achieve\nthe final results that you expect from Canon I am more than well satisfied.  The 8800F outperforms the 8400F in every way and the colors\nare more true to the originals also.;The Canon 8800F exceeds my expectations...
127;5.0;4.0;240.0;-669.5357894736842;Good News, Bad News.  I purchased this scanner based on numerous positive reviews.  I was looking primarily for a negative/slide scanner, but I did not want to lay out the bucks for a dedicated slide scanner.  I actually would have considered one of the higher-end Epsons, like the V500, but I was sold on the LED illumination and quickstart capabilities of the 8800F.  For the record I have owned an Epson 1650 and an Epson 1240U, upgrading each time to take advantage of some new capability.  None of my scanners, ranging all the way back to my first PlusTek has died on me.\n\nFirst the bad news.  Negative scanning is NSG (not so good).  That is not to say that the Canon is not good compared to other scanners, but it takes about 1 minute to scan a single negative panel at 1200dpi, and it takes about 4 minutes to scan at 2400dpi, the math works.  2X linear equals 4X area.  After doing a couple of test scans, I came to the conclusion that the incremental quality of 2400dpi was not worth 3 minutes per slide for a family photo archive project.  I was also coming to the conclusion that 1 minute per negative panel would not really work for me.\n\nOn to the good news.  I decided to scan 4 prints.  I took them out of one of our family photo albums, and started the scan.  WHOA!  The machine scanned the photos in the amount of time it took my Epson 1650 to do a preview scan.  The wonders of modern technology!  I checked the default resolution, and it turns out to be 300dpi.  I had experimented in the past with resolutions up to 4800dpi for family photos, and finally realized that 300dpi is sufficient for all normal (4x6 etc) size prints.  I only use higher resolutions for smaller prints.\n\nThe Canon guys have fixed every problem I have ever had with a scanner.  The negative holder does a GOOD job of flattening out curved negatives.  The lid is HEAVY, which is good, so I don't have to dig out a fat book to help flatten curved photo prints.  The LED illuminators come on instantly, so no waiting for the fluorescent lights to warm up.  And finally, it's FAST.\n\nLast but not least, if you use their scanning utility (with the zippy name of MP Navigator EX) it puts EXIF information if you store your images in JPEG.  I have always thought that would be an excellent improvement to scanners.\n\nI have been scanning family type photos for about 10 years now, and I have to say that the Canon CanoScan 8800F addresses every improvement I have dreamed up on my own for flatbed scanners.  Now if they can make a scanner that will scan 4 negatives in 7 seconds, I will deem them perfect.  In the meantime, I have to rate them as 'almost perfect'.\n\nThe only reason I give them 4 stars is that I technically purchased the unit to scan negatives and found 1 minute per negative panel to be a slight disappointment.  For normal print photo scanning I would give them a 5 easily.  The control panel for Amazon does not let me select 4.5\n\naddendum:\n2008-02-02 I have used this scanner to scan some more slides.  They still take a while, but I have the slides, what am I going to do?  The only way to get the EXIF information is if you use the MP Navigator program.  I have tried using the TWAIN facility with both Irfanview and Picasa.  The scans are fine, but no EXIF information.  I was concerned after scanning some Whale Watching slides, as the 2nd-4th panels would not have the edges of the slides detected well.  The water was deep blue.  After scanning slides with landlubber type backgrounds, grass, dirt, etc., all of those had slide edges detected properly.  All I had to do with the Whale Watching photos was crop to edit out some black borders.\n\nMy Epson 1650 would sometimes screw up the orientation of the slide.  It would decide that a landscape slide should be portrait, cutting off the sides, or a portrait slide was landscape, cutting off the top and bottom.  It was a major nuisance when that happened, and even if I attempted to preview the slide multiple times, rotating it, for some slides it would never get the image right.  So far I have not had that problem with the 8800F.;Canon CanoScan 8800F
2;6.0;4.0;5.0;-97.77605263157893;I bought this scanner to scan my in-laws vast collection of slides and pictures.\n\nI ended up with a significant lesson on software updating before I could actually use the scanner.  My new computer runs Windows 7 which for some reason throws the software bundled with this scanner into a tailspin.\n\nAfter much research online I finally found all of the various work arounds and updates necessary to allow Windows 7 and the scanner software to communicate and be compatible with each other.\n\nThat said... the scanner is EXCELLENT!!!  Easy and quick to use, creating quality scans of both negatives and prints.  I love the fact that I can scan 4 slides at once.\n\nNow that I have the software issues mastered, I am completely pleased with this purchse.  However, if you are not computer savey and up for researching all the updates and work arounds, then you might want to look elseware.\n\nCannon could make this a lot easier if they just put the information on their website in an easy place to find about how to make this scanner work with Windows 7.;Nice scanner, but outdated software

The negative holder is super-flimsy as well so I am giving it extra care.  (Wish me luck - I'm about to call Canon.)\n\nThe scans of 45-year-old negatives is really great - no complaints there.;Great Scanner But Flimsy Removable Parts
146;8.0;4.0;139.0;-353.906923076923;After reviewing several scanners - I decided to try the Canon CS8800F as a replacement for a broken Epson 1670 scanner. It was difficult to decide because none of the brick & mortar stores had one to look at, but I chose the Canon for several reasons: ability to scan 35mm film (we have a large library to begin putting on the computer), quick with the LED/no warmup tmes, and reported ease/stability with OS X (Mac).\n\nEase of Use: I'm very pleased with it's ease of use - my 9 year old sons can (on their own) copy/print documents using just the buttons on the scanner and not having to do anything on our family computer. My mother-in-law can as well.\n\nQuick: it's quick. For intermittent use, and it's no-warmup time. My wife complained about the previous scanners warmup time, so this was a reason to look at/buy it. I haven't used it enough for regular work to determine how fast it is for higher resolution work, but so far it is seems fast on the default scans.\n\nI can easily make multipage pdf documents for emailing and/or faxing to friends/family - this feature has come in handy - although that wasn't initially a reason why i looked it it.\n\nSo far, the software has been everything that it should be - doesn't slow down or crash our OS X 10.4.x like the Epson software would. Run in native Intel mode (iMac Intel).\n\nThe cons i can think of at the moment is it would be nice if it had a LONG usb cable adaptor, but considering i placed the unit about 10 feet away, that's longer that probably any product has a cable for. And the most annoying issue is the noise it makes while scanning. We do a lot of scanning work after my 9 year olds are in bed and if they aren't already asleep they can easily hear the scanning down the hall. It tends to be a high pitched whine. If this unit could be improved, that is what could be improved and why i'm giving it only 4 stars out of 5.\n\nI haven't had a chance to evaluate the film scanning just yet, i may add that to a later review and there may be some minor issues with OS X 10.5 and the software. The scans work, but the software crashes after the scan. It worked fine with 10.4.10 that i'm looking into right now, so i suspect an update soon should be forthcoming from either Apple or Canon about that.\n\nJohn Q.;Review of Canon CS8800F scanner on OS X

I thought it might have been dust on the photo or on the scanner, so I proceeded to clean it.  Rescan and the photo looked better, but it generated noise where there shouldn't have been any..  Note I did recalibrate the scanner, and it occurred on both the glossy and matted photos.  I would understand why it would occur on matted photos.. but on glossy?  I played with all the settings and made it look a tad better, but it would still create artifacts.  I cleaned up the artifacts by treating them like scratches.. but that is a bad way of fixing it due to lose of resolution quality.  Maybe I just had bad luck picking a bad one.  I'll try exchanging it..\n\nNote that I scanned in about 20 different types of photos over the ages and all of them had this problem...\n\nAddon:  I tried scanning in ""Magazine (Color)"" mode instead of the Photo mode and got better results.. very strange.

148;10.0;5.0;109.0;-226.35874999999993;My CanoScan 8800F arrived from Amazon earlier than anticipated which is usual for Amazon and great for me.  Setup was very easy.  This scanner and its software is definitely made for VISTA.  It comes with Adobe Photoshop Elements ver 5. (Yesterday I saw a copy of ver 6 on the store shelf).  The included software is easy to install and performs well.  However, there are no printed manuals other than the Quick Start Guide.  In addition to Photoshop Elements, it comes with ArcSoft PhotoStudio ver 5.5 and ScanGear which must be installed and used if you want to scan 35mm film, slides or 126/620 film.\n\nI was impressed by the fact that it would automatically crop different size images being scanned.  However, I soon discovered that it did not always do the autocrop and when I manually cropped, it did not save the cropped image.  Hopefully the help screen will tell me what I did wrong.\n\nI scanned some 35mm negatives and it will do up to 12 images in one session and take about 8 minutes.  I also tested the scanning of some 35mm color slides and it will do 4 in one session and take about 2 minutes.  The slides just drop into the holder.  I figure that if I sat at the computer and paid attention, I could scan about 60 color slides an hour, giving time for placing them in the holder and then saving the images.  This does not include time for the auto retouch software to work.  My saved unretouched color slides are about 1.5 MB in size when saved as a JPEG.\n\nOverall I am very pleased with my 8800F purchase.  One note of displeasrue was the fact that the Canon website would not allow me to register my purchase as part of the setup/install process.  It took all of the information, but then rejected it.;Impressed
149;11.0;5.0;108.0;-24.513823529411752;I've now had the scanner for several weeks, and I'm really impressed with how well the scanner works. It gives consistent results every time. I haven't played with the software that came with the scanner, but it imports just fine using Photoshop Elements 5. I'm running Vista and it hasn't caused Vista to hiccup once.\nI've tried several settings, and I get the best results if I scan at 4800, and each slide takes around 2-3 min.\n\nFor regular scanning it is quite fast. I can do a copy from the scanner to the printer. In fact my printer is one of those all in one jobs, I can do a copy from the Canon to the printer, faster than I can do a copy with the printer alone.;I was surprised!
122;12.0;4.0;96.0;-341.65551724137924;"This scanner is fantastic.  I just got it as an early birthday present from my wondeful wife and parents and it's been a spectacular gift - as another reviewer has noted, ""far exceeding my expectations.""\n\nI had planned on getting this scanner initially, but ended up getting an HP G4050 because it could scan 4x5 negatives (this one does not).  I regretted the G4050 decision as soon as I tried it out: because it does NOT truly work with Windows Vista (the 8800F does).  I took the G4050 back the day after I got it and immediatly ordered the 8800F.\n\nAs so many people have noted, the software and interface for this scanner is amazingly easy to use and very intuitive.  You can choose between ""simple"" and more advanced modes of scanning which makes it all a snap.  The scanner is also very fast: previews of images only take a few seconds and the actual scans are quick as well - yet the quality remains beautiful.\n\nThe scanner comes with 3 CD-Roms.  One contains the scanner software, and then there's two CD-Roms with Photoshop Elements: one for Vista and one for Mac OS - that alone is a roughly $80 dollar value (what I paid for my copy of Elements).  Also included are the power cords (of course) the USB cable, and holders for 35mm, Slides, and Medium Format film.\n\nAlthough Canon doesn't advertise that the 8800F can be set to scan black and white negatives, it does have setting to do so: and I must say that the scans of my black and white negatives look suprisingly good, all things considered.  If you get a professional scanner for b/w negatives you'll have to actually put the negatives in a mineral oil which helps with scratches, etc., but for simple b/w scans that will certainly work well enough for snapshots and memories, the 8800F produces excellent results.\n\nAs much as I'm enjoying this scanner, I'm curious about some of the decisions that Canon made with it (hence the 4 star rating instead of the 5).  I wish that they would have given this scanner 4x5 capability as well as 35mm and medium format.  Not only would being able to do 4x5 be a great feature, but it would allow more than two rows of 35mm negatives and one row of medium format or slides - it'd be nice to be able to scan larger batches.\n\nOverall this is a great scanner and I'd recommend it to anyone...thanks for another great product, Canon!";Beautiful...

Yes, the sharpness and color fidelity imparted with this scanner are so good I consider it worthwhile to REDO about a years work of archiving.\nI started by rescanning some of the photos to see how the new scans compared with those from the 8400 I had used for my archives. Most comparisons showed the raw scan of the 8800 to be superior, and never less than equal to the 8400. I really liked the 8400. I LOVE the 8800.\n\nThe scanner is very fast. The final scan of a 4x6"" photo takes about 3-4 seconds. I do about 100 pictures in an hour, even with the need to tweak some using the Canon Navigator software. You can do multiple pictures in one pass, but I like to look at each picture individually and crop it as I scan.\nOne useful tip is to use the Advanced mode and set the ""Paper Size"" to fit\nthe most common size of your photos. My typical photos are 4x6 or smaller so I use the ""2 L Landscape"" that creates a 7""x5"" scan template (i.e. the scanner only travels about 1/2 way down the platen each scan both saving\ntime and potential wear , and also eliminates the need to ""zoom"" to get\na good size picture displayed for tweaking and cropping.\n\nDid I mention that I LOVE THIS SCANNER?";A GREAT Scanner

Use a dust remover air bulb or compressed air.  Plus clean the bed frequently.  Another tip; if you are scanning a large number of photographs, or in my case old (1900's type) wash hands frequently.  Keep finger tips clean or as I state below, invest in nylon gloves to handle photos.\n2. I'm scanning film negatives and color positives that are very fragile and one broke (brittle) while moving it to the scanner.  My only suggestion is to use archive quality gloves for old negatives and glass mounted photos\n3. Buy and use a film cleaning solution and handle each one carefully.  I know that goes without saying, but I've found a lot of BW shots have fingerprints on their face and they add more noise to end item.\n4.  I'm not promoting anything but I'm using a Photoshop plug-in Noise Ninja to control excessive noise gained through scanning and Kodak ROC for color restoration processes.  This saves me hours of color matching and testing swatches.  I still need to adjust for some, but this saves me hours of computer time.\n5.  I've surpassed 2K scanned photos so far and it's still working like a charm.  I have another 1/2 million to go.\n5. 120 film negatives have become a problem; perhaps it's due to age but I'm running into difficulty getting the scanner to recognize them.  It's been hit and miss.  I suspect the top side scanning lamp may not be wide enough or bright enough to sense the negative.\nAfter 919 scans of various kinds of media, I have a mixed bag of reviews.  Beginning with 35mm slides and negatives - works great.  Black and white 120 size came out great.  It took me a while to make 120 work work though.  The carrier was too small for large format, 4x6, so I had to improvise and that took a lot of time. Once I learned to use large format, then I tested it with 110 negatives.  No luck with those.  These are too small for the scanner to sense and I pushed the capabilities of this scanner.  Overall it worked as designed, quick and fast.\nI also used the advanced, simple and multiscan settings and they worked perfect.\nScanned documents looked like the originals after scanning and printing.\nIn summary I used each setting and they worked flawlessly.  My request to Canon is to add a carrier for larger format film, it would make it easier to scan.\nI used this with a Mac, new version, and it works really great.  If I really get technical and want professional grade reproductions, that's when I go to photo labs, but those visits are rare.  This is a great scanner for the price and it did everything I asked without failing or crashing.\nFor mid range scanning, and non-professional photo work, this is a great scanner.  But if you are a professional and demand lab perfect photos, this may not be what you want.  But for my use, semi-pro and commercial work, this is perfect for my use.";Great Scanner

56;20.0;5.0;31.0;-501.28589315525863;"I have done some semi-professional photography and have hundreds of 35mm negatives and numerous color positive slides, and was in need of a film/negative/slide scanner for a marketing venture. I did countless hours of research on the 'net and at manufacturer's websites. Funds were limited, and I was torn between the Canon CanoScan 8800F and an Espon 500 or 700. What sold me on the Canon is that there was a lesser percentage of negative reviews than there is with the Espons. So, I bought it, and have given it a try. And I must say that it was money well spent!\n\nJust so you know, my computer setup is an eMachines W6409. I'm running Windows XP Media Center Addition, SP3, and have all of the required updates. It's a Pentium 4 CPU running at 3.00GHz and I added more memory (total 1.37 GB of RAM). I've also installed a Pioneer DVR-113NP DVD burner with LightScribe, and use it as my master with the stock DVD burner set up as the slave.\n\nThere is a learning curve with this Canon, as there is with any new piece of equipment or software. And yes, scanning can take awhile, and is dependent on the chosen scanning resolution. I got *fantastic* results when scanning my sunset color positive slides in 4800 dpi with Autotone OFF, Unsharp Mask ON, Remove Dust And Scratches HIGH, Fading Correction NONE, Grain Correction LOW, and Backlight Correction NONE. These settings are in the ScanGear's software ""Advanced Mode"". I'm currently scanning color negatives in 2400 dpi with equally good results. I have a scan running as I write this review actually. I'll try to include some photos that I've scanned if it's possible to do so.\n\nThe software that came with the scanner is ok, and it does the job. However I 'did' have to delete and reinstall the scanner and drivers once because the ScanGear and/or the DriverScanner was freezing up on me. As for software, I'm not a big Microsoft fan, but I very much like the Microsoft Digital Image 2006 Editor, which I have as a trial. It does what I want and need. So right now, when I scan a set of slides or negatives, I have the ScanGear software open up the included Adobe Photoshop Elements 5.00 for a quick visual review and to save the photos in the appropriate (chosen) directory. I'll later edit in the MS Digital Image 2006 Editor program.\n\nIn agreement with other reviews regarding the film holders, yes, they are a bit flimsy. Just use the gentleness and care that you'd use for your priceless film, slides, and photos, and you'll be fine.\n\nTip...\nWhen I first used the scanner, I got the following error:\nCannot scan for these reasons:\nThe original may not be set correctly\nThe protective sheet may be put in place\nThe lock switch may not be released\nScanner driver will be closed.\nCode: 2,178,0\nWell... the original WAS set correctly, and the scanner was NOT locked. I scratched my head... I KNEW that I had removed all of the protective plastic, too! Upon searching Canon's website for this error, I found that there's a solid plastic backing on the inside of the lid that needed to be removed. Perhaps this is in the manual. But hey... I'm a guy <grin> :).\n\nI'm very happy with this scanner. I think you will be too.";Great Product!

The LiDE was fine and produced decent scans, but there were occasional color issues and it was always so very, very slow. I've had the 8800F for about a month now, and it's done wonders with everything I've thrown at it. Old 78 rpm record labels, black and white documents, color photographs--they all look great. (I don't have any slides to scan, so I can't comment on the slide-scanning ability.) Although the scanner is quite a bit larger than my LiDE, it feels much sturdier (the weighted lid is a big help) and the speed is incredible! A 4x6 photo that used to take me 3+ minutes to scan at 300 dpi on my old scanner now scans in less than five seconds! While the scanner is great, I'm not crazy about the bundled Canon scanner software for my Mac (running 10.4). One of the most irritating aspects is that after scanning an image, I have to manually select the output format (TIFF, JPG, etc.) and quality setting before saving. When batch scanning a bunch of photos, it can get very tiresome doing this over and over again. Why can't I save my scan settings? I used a third-party scanner software with my previous scanner and I could specify a default output format and quality setting, then scan away uninterrupted.

No extra downloads, etc.\n\nI'm not very technically oriented but I had the scanner up and running in no time. It's easy to figure out, and the scans are beautiful. I'm sure that once I have more time I will read the on-screen manual provided to learn more about what I can do with it.\n\nIt's a nice-looking, sturdy piece of equipment, not a flimsy piece of junk.

I reveiwed the most recent Consumer Reports testing of flatbed scanners in which Canon scored as a Best Buy for the under $100 model. I came down to two models, the Canon and the HP.  The Hp model was lower in the Consumer Reports ratings, but far higher in cost (about $450) but it could scan more slides at a time. For further research, I went to HP's and Canon's web sites for each of the models. that was a big help. I settled on the Canon and I have not been disappointed. I am extremely pleased with my purchase. I have scanned about 1,000 black & white photos that were 40-90 years old. i have scanned about 20 slides. i am scanning photos at 600 dpi, slides at 2400-3600 dpi.  Small contact prints from the 1930s & 1940s were easily cleaned up with the ""enhance"" tools which removed dust spots. The ""magic wand"" button on the tool bar gives one the ability to improve and restore original contrast and sharpen the photo from a variety of choices. the result is a beautifully restored photo. the same holds true for old color photos and slides (20-60 years old).  many color photos showed signs of fading and loss of color.  These can be restored to their original quality as described above.  slides are a longer process, but you can do 4 at a time.  One problem was figuring out how to do slides.  you need to open the scanner lid and ""remove the white backing"" by pressing the button at the top of the lid. then lay the slide holder down on the glass.";A Great Scanner!!!
72;25.0;1.0;29.0;-137.52999999999997;I read all the reviews from Amazon and other web site prior to this purchase which had amazing review for the Canon Scanner. I've already owned 4 scanners in the past and hoped the new CanoScan -LED technology would scan faster and produce clearer images.  I've purchased the unit but did not use it until a few months later. (Had to buy a new PC). Unfortunately, all my scanned photos scanned had specs on them and document manuals scanned seemed a bit blurry.  I made 3 phone calls to tech support (Canon tech support people are good), but could they could not improve the scanned images. (Also I've cleaned the glass several times). Tech support told me they will send me a refurbish unit, even though my unit was a new one. They cannot sent me a new unit since my purchase has been past 30 days time frame.  Unfortunately even the refurbish units are not available from Canon at this time. I'm waiting for them to ship me a refurbish  unit and it's already been almost 2 weeks. If you buy the 8800f, test the unit immediately.  Scan a picture with black or dark color to spot the artifacts.  It seem to be a common problem with the 8800f.  If you google users review for Canoscan 8800f and problems, others seem to have the same problem as my situation.;Specs on the scan

It is not clear what is required vs what Canon thinks you might like to have.  Hookup to the computer is also simple.  One power cord and one USB cable.  The power block has a standard power cable instead of the brick that takes up two outlets worth of space on a power strip.\n\nI configured one of the front panel buttons, so the procedure for scanning 35mm slides is: load slides, push button, wait for preview scan (15 sec), select image(s) for detailed scan, click scan button, wait for scan to complete.  A 1200 dpi scan takes about 2 minutes for 4 slides, a 2400 dpi scan takes about 4 minutes.\n\nIt is probably possible to configure the system to eliminate some of the steps but as is usually the case, the documentation is not the greatest. I would rate it as fair.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't hesitate to buy this scanner.;So easy a 10 year old can run it.

71;28.0;3.0;27.0;-79.18497005988021;I purchased this to archive a lot of photographs.  The main reason I wanted this was its ability to batch scan (fill the platen and during the scan it automatically separates each picture in its own file).  But, the software has a few issues.  First, it will not batch-scan photographs above 600 dpi.  If you have several small photographs that you want scanned at a higher resolution, you must scan 1 at a time.\n\nAlso, I was really looking forward to pressing one of the buttons on the top to start the batch scan.  But, this has limitations.  Doing that will not apply the noise reduction and other enhancements!  Those features are very important.  To batch scan with those requires 3 mouse clicks.\n\nPhoto scanning at 600 dpi is extremely fast and images look fantastic.  Slide scanning at the higher resolutions (which you want for slides), is ungodly slow.  If you have a lot of slides or negatives, you may wish to consider something faster.;No batch scanning of photographs above 600 dpi.
49;29.0;3.0;22.0;-97.38499999999998;Pros:  great image quality, resolution, quick, and quiet.\nCons:  Mechanical longevity.  After about 20 days of significant use over the course of an year, the glass platten came unglued.  I was scanning mostly slides, film, and photos.  No books, so no extra pressure/weight on the platten.\nStrangely, the platten is not supported by anything underneath - it is simply suspended from the plastic frame by glue.  The glue is still tacky, therefore its strength may have been affected by room temperature.  However, the whole time the scanner has always been at home, and not exposed to more than 80 deg F.\nWith the platten hanging on one side, it contacts the scanner head and causes it to stick or the drive belt to skip, with major noise and wear on the plastic gear.  I reattached the platten with superglue and it works but will likely be a temporary fix. I would be extremely careful loading the platten in any way especially since the plastic suspension frame is flexible and loads the glue in shear.  A simple support on the underside of the glass would have eliminated the issue.;Great scanner but beware of mechanical design issue
78;30.0;5.0;27.0;-361.1840939597315;"Previous reviews of the Canoscan 8800f were very helpful in deciding which multi purpose scanner to purchase to replace scanners I've been using for years. I have 100's of personal and old family slides to scan, as well as needing to scan sketches and drawings for my own art work. In the few days I've owned the Canoscan 8800f, I've scanned several line drawings (8.5"" x 11""), and over 150 35 mm slides. For both purposes, this scanner seems is more than adequate and will continue to be as I gain more knowledge of all it can do and consequently place more demands on the scanner. I am extremely impressed with the quality of the slide scans - the first time I've seen such high quality in other than a Nikon dedicated slide scanner. the software options seem to have enough user control to handle what I need to do. As with other positive reviews, color, quality, grain handling, unsharp masking all seem to work fairly well, especially given the price of the scanner.\n\nOne review discussed light artifacts in the upper corners when doing slide scans, which I also experienced. They suggested putting paper under the slide holder tray, covering the finger cutouts. This was an extremely useful tip, as I began to notice the artifacts on my scans. Paper under the slide holder tray, covering the finger cutouts works. thank you to that reviewer.\n\nI bought the 8800f because of lack of warmup time with the LED lights. With previous scanners, warmup times quickly discouraged me from continuing the effort to scan all my slides. Quality has not been this good before on scanners I've used before, either. While not lightning fast (4 minutes for 4 slides @ 2400 dpi), the lack of warmup time eliminates a major frustration in batch scanning. Eventually, I'll scan the majority of my slide collection.\n\nRegarding resolution, it is my understanding (though I'm no expert) that the emulsion on most 35mm film is equal to about 3200 (plus or minus) pixels in the longest direction. Scanning at 2400 dpi yields approximately 3224 pixels in the longest direction. In my estimation, while scanning at higher rates may be useful for larger printing, it may not be necessarily useful for screen viewing, or normal printing up to 8"" x 10"". Higher resolutions may, in fact, make images appear `blurrier' due to exceeding the effective resolution of the slide film emulsion. Given that it takes significantly more time to scan at higher resolutions, it may not be worth it for most users in most circumstances.\n\nOverall, this is a great scanner.";Canoscan 8800f

The previous reviewers who rated this product highly are correct, and I will summarize those points in a quick format because it works for me.\n- Easy to install (Windows 7)\n- Began scanning old 35mm color negatives immediately\n- Software automatically identifies the negatives when using the holder and scans them in.  You don't have to worry about cropping each negative from a pre-scan.  I love that!\n\nAs other reviewers point out, the disappointments are related to the film, not the scanner:\n- It's reasonably quick to put the negatives into the holder, but scanning takes time regardless of the scanner.\n- Picture quality on the negatives isn't what we're used to today.  Even at 4800dpi they're blurry compared to digital photos.  I went back to 2400dpi for a faster scan time.\n- I started with 30-year-old negatives and they're pretty beat up after many moves and being stored in old boxes.  No miracles.\n- Negatives get scratched and the photos dim with age.  Either way this scanner will do its best to recover the picture and give you basic tools to clean it up.\n- You can use software to improve the pictures, but that depends on your skill with that software.  I haven't tried the bundled software because I have a *lot* of negatives to scan and I'll play with it later.

One snowy day in January, I sat down with the scanner and did my 100 slides (high resolution) and was very pleased with the quality of the finished product, and above all - the TIME. Even high resolution photos scan amazingly fast and - praise be to the heavens above - there is NO LAMP to warm up. Apparently, it uses an LED light so it's extra expeditious.\n\nThe only complaint: It took me some time (and a few bowling words) to figure out how to use the slide feature. The slides have to be scanned against a white background, so there's an insert on the LID that has to be removed before the slide scanner will function correctly. IMHO, the directions on this little detail are woefully lacking.\n\nIn conclusion, my only complaint is that the directions regarding those slides were poor. I long for the days when devices came with instruction books. That would have saved me about 75 minutes when I was trying desperately to figure out why it wouldn't scan my slides.

It takes about five minutes of scan time to process a batch of four slides at 2400dpi.  Add a little time to catalog and save and I can scan and store about thirty to forty slides an hour.  Higher resolution scans can take much longer.  The quality at 2400dpi has been satisfactory for any 4x6.  I have also used the scanner for prints and have had good results.  I believe this machine represents a bargain.  I have since used the machine to scan film strips. You can take your processed film and scan it before you print to see if you have something worth the expense of printing and enlargements. I have also found it useful when you find the odd old envelope of 120 negatives.\n\nAdded Comment:  When scanning slides, if the slide is marked ""This Side Towards Screen"", place this side down on the scanning bed.  I have had chromatic aberrations (things that look like rainbows) appear on my scanned images.  If I turn the slide over and scan again, this aberration always disappears.  Also, when placing this side down, the scanned image is often reversed. Things that you know are on the left appear on the right side of the scanned image.  The provided software (called PhotoStudio) allows you to change orientation by mirroring the image.  At this point I transfer the JPEG for storage to my regular photo software.  This is because if you mirror the image it will be upside-down.  Rotating the image with the provided software sometimes cuts off the edges of the picture.

Things progressed normally and after rebooting, attaching the scanner and allowing the driver to load I was ready to scan. Unfortunately my Vista Ultimate machine would not properly communicate with the scanner. When I attempted to use the included scanning utility I received and error message telling me that the drivers were not installed, and yet, they were.\n\nAfter about an hour of my own troubleshooting using Canon's web site I called Technical Support. I was quickly connected with a very nice woman who's first language was English (what a surprise). For the next two hours she worked with me on various fixes including installing the scanner on my old Windows XP Pro machine (where it worked fine by the way. Unfortunately nothing worked. It appears that although the scanner's twain driver was loaded something was blocking the scanner software from accessing it.\n\nI did a little research on the web and the only thing I could find that might be relevant was a comment that Canon scanners can be finicky as regards USB ports and a reference to changing an IRQ setting in the BIOS, which worked for the writer, but which I did not choose to undertake.\n\nSo, highly rated by others everywhere but it just won't work with my particular Vista Ultimate system. If it happens once, it can happen again so I am writing this to allow readers to understand that their experience might not be as rosy as that of others. I have my RA from Amazon and the box is waiting for UPS to pick it up for the return trip.;Would not install in Vista Ultimate

I chose this particular model to replace 4 aging AGFA scanners at our school in part because it came bundled with some OCR software. I was very disappointed to find that the OCR software Canon included was a version that was a couple of years old and not compatible with the Mac OS 10.6.  I felt there should at least have been a disclaimer to that effect, but instead we had to wait to find that out until the installer of the OCR software failed. I had to spend another $90 dollars to get that software piece from a third party vendor. That meant the very good price we found through Amazon wasn't such a great price after all. Other than the OCR problem, the scanner is very good. The ""no wait"" scanning made possible by using LED lamps is very much faster than our old scanners. That is something important when you have a line of students in your class waiting to scan.";8800F works fine, but the OCR software is not compatible with Mac 10.6.

I received the unit yesterday and within 5 hours had it packed and ready for return today.\nI went through the install process exactly as written on both my Vista and XP machines and in both cases got the exact same error message every time I tried to preview or scan. It suggested I turned the scanner off and on again. I did that. Many times. To no avail.\nI called Canon and spoke with a very pleasant and helpful support rep for about 2 1/2 hours. She said there was nothing more she could do and suggested I return the unit to Canon (she would arrange this) and I would receive a 'refurbished' unit in exchange. At this point the unit had been in my possession for about 5 hours. Obviously not an acceptable option. I've processed a return with Amazon and will continue looking.;Sent back within 5 hours...
33;42.0;5.0;13.0;-54.56112582781455;Over the years I have been continually disappointed by every scanner I have used. They were slow. The software was a hassle. The sheet size of the output never matched the input -- I mean who needs an 8.5 x 11.41 sheet anyway! Now my life has changed. I might be more willing to part with a bodily organ or two than my new CanoScan 8800. As an architect I needed a way to easily convert pen and ink sketches into electronic documents. The ease of using the CanoScan allows me to treat pen and paper as an essential computer-based drawing tool.  Previous scanners were too cumbersome to dash off a quick hand sketch and email to contractor in the field. Not now. It's almost as easy as passing it to the next desk. JPGs, PDFs - easy. Black and white, color, grayscale - easy. No surprises. Works right every time.;Best Damned Scanner Ever!
136;43.0;4.0;20.0;-306.50488664987404;This is the first Canon scanner I have owned. I bought it based on the technical specs and because other Canon scanners had fairly positive reviews.\n\nI have have had 3 Epson scanners over the last 10 years and have been very pleased with the image quality, but somewhat disappointed with the software and heat up time for the lamp (which is typical for most scanners). The CanoScan 8800F appeared to have a better software package according to the literature and would be faster with no heat up time required for the lamp.\n\nI still have my last Epson scanner which is a Perfection 3170. I use it on another computer so I was able to do some comparison scans with both scanners.\n\nResults:\nFor standard pdf scans, copies and faxes, the image quality of the Epson was quite noticeably better using standard mode scans. The Canon was much faster but I was disappointed that the image quality at 150 and 300 dpi was not better or at least as good.\n\nFor picture scans, both scanners did a very good job. Again, I liked the image quality and color of the Epson, but was not displeased with the Canon.\n\nConclusion: I bought this scanner as an update to the Epson which is 2 years old and because I was hoping for an improvement in speed and overall image quality. My thoughts are that the Canon is a good scanner but I was disappointed that it didn't blow the Epson away. It has more buttons on the front but you still have to use the software to set up each. I am not impressed with the MP Navigator software that came with the Canon. It has no advantage over Epson as some have inferred in their reviews. However, I like the Presto Pagemanager and Photoshop Elements. I use the scanner for a variety of applications, like making copies, digitizing to PDF files, digitizing prints and slides (which can later be touched up using Adobe) and for faxing. I have not scanned any slides or color negatives yet. There may be some adjustments I can make to improve the quality of B&W and grayscale images. I will do some investigating into that. I mainly wanted to share my initial impressions of the Canon as compared to my experience with older Epson scanners.;Fast scanner but image quality not as good as I had hoped
9;44.0;5.0;7.0;-50.61172413793099;This is by far the easiest scanner I have ever used.  Everything worked right out of the box and we were scanning within one hour of receiving the product.  We had over 2,500 slides we wanted to convert to digital for preservation, etc.  The conversion cost at CostCo (the cheapest) was very expensive.  We decided to do it ourselves and save money with the CanoScan.  The process was easy (we scanned about 100 slides per day and completed the project in a little over one month) and we ended up saving a ton of money and now have our own scanner to boot.\n\nWe have now started to scan our picture negatives from years ago.  This is also an easy process and we are doing about 12 35MM film strips per day in between normal daily activities.\n\nYou won't be disappointed.;Do it Yourself Slide and Negative conversion to digital images

Always ran into problems with HPs and Epsons.\nTransparency holders are kind of flimsy and fragile, but so is the film. I guess it's common practise.;Good stuff for the money
76;46.0;5.0;16.0;-257.24017241379306;I bought this scanner last month with the intention of being able to scan some old negatives (35 mm and 120 format film), slides, and photos, along with the occasional document.  For the price and what I am looking for (personal use and printing photos from scans), this scanner has been great and I would recommend it for any amateur, prosumer, or even professional looking for a quality, yet inexpensive scanner.\n\nI searched on the internet for a while looking for a scanner that would accomplish what I needed and ultimately decided on this Canon model.  For digital, I'm a Nikon guy, but Canon's quality is good also, and my assumption that you can't go wrong was a safe one.  I have Vista and it took about 45-50 minutes to install all of the software and get it up and running, which included making sure that I had the most updated drivers from their website.  Among the other software it comes with, it also comes with Photoshop Elements, which (if you don't have regular Photoshop) will do everything you need to do.  I have made prints from scans and the difference between a print from a scan and a print from a digital image is negligible.\n\nOther reviews regarding this scanner were more helpful for me when I was looking at specifics, but here's what I can add: if you're looking for a scanner that will not take a lot of space up on your desk or office, this one is great.  It comes with all of the necessary cables and software, is virtually idiot-proof, and other than the occasional time where you may have to scan a negative twice to get it right, it's great.  Scan from 120 mm take about 2-3 minutes depending on how you touch it up pre-editing, but most scans take about a minute.  You can't go wrong with this scanner and you should not hesitate to buy it if you're on the fence between this one and other comparable priced scanners.;Scanner simple to use/set up, works with Vista, will do everything you will need it to do
99;47.0;4.0;17.0;-482.6877486910994;(Updated 1/28/2012) I have scanned approximately 2500 slides with the Canon 8800F. The scan results are adequate for my slides, but I am not as enthusiastic about this scanner as some of the reviewers. It is way too slow for a large job when the scan is at 3200 dpi. For smaller jobs or lower resolution, it would be a very good choice.\nThe setup took about 30 minutes - following the sketchy instructions. The software included Photoshop elements 5.0, and that is nice. I already owned that software, so it was no additional value to me. Without going into details about the packaged scanner software, it has not been difficult to use. However, trial and error has been the means to determine the effects of the various settings. You may want to explore the settings to determine what works best before setting out to scan dozens (or hundreds) of slides.\nThe quality of the scans is better than I expected with one exception. I ran into a stray light issue. The slide adapter has nice large reliefs cut on each side of the slide holder to permit easy removal of slides. Big fingers can easily get to the slides, but so can a whole lot of light. I posted two photos. One shows the stray light spilling across one of the upper corners of the image. It is a large area and not something to touch up with Photoshop. I did find a solution. I placed a sheet of paper under the slide holder in a position that would block light from passing through the finger reliefs. I posted a photo that shows the improved scan quality.\nOne other quality issue was noticed. The scanner came with a small piece of plastic stuck to the inside of the glass. It isn't in the area of the slides, so I have not tried to find a way inside to remove it. Also, the glass was pretty dirty and needed cleaned.\nScanning at 4800 dpi has been slow and 3200 did not seem any faster. Four slides take about 10 to 15 minutes. 2400 was much faster but the reduction in resolution was not acceptable to me.\nThe additional time to manually remove dust using Photoshop can add a lot of seat time. The simple dust and scratch filter reduces sharpness, so I have avoided using it.\nIf you have a large number of slides, may I suggest a faster scanner with an automatic feeder. Pay the money, get the job done, then resell the scanner. You'll not spend a whole lot more money and you will save many, many hours of your time.\nA higher end scanner may use better techniques to minimize dust effects, so you could save a lot of editing time. A friend scanned some slides for me using his Nikon scanner, and the results were much better and required less of my time in an editor.\nThe stray light problem is shown in the image titled:\nCanon 8800F Scanner Stray Light\nThe improvement achieved with a piece of paper used to block the stray light is seen in the image titled:\nCanon 8800F Scanner Stray Light Solution\nOverall, this scanner was a good purchase, but for the size job I had to do, I wish I had gone for something a little better. For small jobs and occassional scanning, this is probably a good choice.;Canon 8800F Slide Scanning

After every 3-4 scans it would not work and would give a message that I had to restart the scanner.  It would then work for another 3-4 scans and then I would have to restart it again.  I did everything to correct the problem. Finally I called Canon tech support. They were very good and supportive. They couldn't solve the problem and after an hour and a half decided that the hardware was bad and sent me a replacement. It did the same thing. I later read that one reviewer said this scanner does not work properly with XP and Canon never updated the software to fix the problem. I returned the one to Canon and the other one to Amazon. When it worked the scans were excellent, Canon support was great, and Amazon was good about a refund. That is the only reason I didn't give it all zeroes.

Reviews on the compact models were hit and miss -- sometimes they were great and sometimes there were significant issues.  Based on that feedback, I decided to ante up an extra $40-50 to get something with positive reviews.  This Canon scanner handles multiple pictures on the screen at one time, recognizing that they are multiple pix.  The holders/trays for slides and negatives are easy to use.  The scanning process for slides and negatives is about 5x longer than for pictures.  If you're scanning slides/negatives, find a decent show on TV and change the slides/negatives each commercial.  TIP -- use the help manual to program the ""1-Touch"" buttons.  I set up separate 1-Touch buttons for pictures, slides and negatives.  This enabled me to set up the pix/slide/negative, click the button, and walk away.  The scanner and software did everything they needed to do without additional clicking from me.  A nice feature is you're a multi-tasker.\n\nI'm using this with a 3-yr old laptop that recently upgraded to Windows 7.";Quality Scanner
6;51.0;3.0;6.0;-167.87045627376423;I needed a quality scanner to digitize 1700 slides for archiving.  The CanoScan is a well designed and solid scanner, but the slide insert held only 4 slides...which meant a lot more scans.  I also noticed a glitch in the software involving how the scanner decided the picture area of the slide (the actual photo area of my slides had a wide variety of aspect ratios).  Since I didn't want to have to go in and manually adjust the scan size for each slide, I wanted to set a larger default and then crop the photos later in a Photoshop Elements.\n\nI contacted customer service about this and after over an hour of troubleshooting on the phone, the rep told me that this was a glitch in the software and since it wasn't typically an issue for customers, it wasn't something being fixed in future updates.  I must say appreciated the honesty of the customer service rep and the time and effort he spent trying to get to the bottom of the problem.  If nothing else, the customer service made feel great about the prospect of buying other Canon products in the future.\n\nIn the end I did return the scanner and picked up an HP model(Scanjet G4050) that held 16-slides at a time and didn't have that problem.  I'm satisfied with that one.\n\nWhile the CanoScan didn't work for my particular need, I did play around with the scanner and thought it was a reasonably priced and overall good quality scanner.;Good Scanner...but not ideal for what I needed.

15;60.0;5.0;8.0;-145.8488412017167;I used to work in a digital imaging studio, where I had access to several high-end scanners. I got quite spoiled as a result and have been disappointed in every home-use scanner I've tried -- until the CanoScan 8800. It's very easy to set up, and the software is pretty intuitive. But more importantly, it produces excellent results, whether you're using it as a flatbed or as a film scanner for negatives and slides. The color balance is excellent and the built-in image-analysis algorithms help preserve shadow and highlight detail. I've been delighted to discover that some of my scans look even better than my carefully hand-made prints.\n\nAlthough it's true that the CanoScan can be a little slow when scanning at high resolutions, it's still faster than some of the commercial scanners that were state-of-the-art just a few years ago. Plus, it's not a big deal if you just set up a batch of 8 to 10 negatives and do something else for a half hour. (The software doesn't seem to take up much RAM, so it's possible to multitask.) Note to Mac users: I'm running Snow Leopard and have had no problems in getting the software and scanner to work on my system.\n\nIf you're looking for an inexpensive home scanner that delivers consistently excellent results, look no further!;Superb scanner.

I use the professional mode to scan pictures and they turn out very light.  I played around with the advance mode, brightness and so on- still the pictures come out terrible.  I have an old Epson Perfection 3170 photo scanner that does very nicely still but very slow.  I still have not found a scanner that I am crazy about.\n\nI just ordered the Epson v30 and all the reviews are great so far.  I hope it stands up to my expectations, unlike the Canon, which did not.  I wish there was a scanner that you could choose what bit you could scan in.  I do not have software that will support 48 bit. I kept getting an error that from the canon scanner that it is unsupported for 48 bit. I have CS2 and Adobe Elements 5.;Disappointed

83;69.0;1.0;12.0;-81.33786982248519;At this point, I am quite disappointed with Canon CanoScan film scanners.\n\nFirst, I was sent a replacement 8800F scanner for my malfunctioning one by Canon. The replacement arrived unfit for use, with the scanner mechanism unlocked.\n\nThen a second replacement was sent. I just completed running some test scans. Comparing the scan quality of the 8800F recently received with scans of the same colour positive films made only days before on my CanoScan 8400F before it malfunctioned, it is plainly evident that the CanoScan 8800F scans are inferior, especially in resolution. Blurry results were produced on the CanoScan 8800F even with the unsharp mask correction turned on. This is contrary to what one might expect from a product update.\n\nPlease see the slide discussion for sample scans.\n\nThe one star was for the speed of the scanner - it is fast. But at the end of the day, isn't quality what we really want?\n\nI will be happy to go with another manufacturer.;Blurry and disappointed - has Canon lost its touch?
113;70.0;5.0;13.0;-244.61478260869558;"I own a Nikon Coolscan V ED that I use for 35mm mouted slide scans.  I needed something for medium format (2 1/4 x 2 1/4) mounted slides - slides that were in cardboard mounts for projection.  I could find nothing that included carriers for this format, but saw that the 8800F would handle 120 film. I figured I would take a chance and see if I could make this scanner work for me.\n\nIt arrived this afternoon.  After unpacking, installation and trying a couple of test scans using the included scangear software, I set about trying to scan my medium format slides.  I first treid using the 120 film holder, but with so-so results.  The film was held too far away from the scanner glass and the side pressure form the locator pins warped the film slightly.  I then took a closer look at the 35mm slide holder and decided that I could make one along the same lines for my larger slides.  I used a piece of illustration board the same size as the scanner glass and cut two rectangular holes in it using the 120 film holder as a guide for the placement of the calibration window and the actual slide scanning window.  I made the slide windw large enough to take the slides in their plastic holders so that I could remove them form the projection magazines and scan them in the holders without removing them from the support frames.\n\nIt worked like a charm!  The backlight in the cover is wide enough to illuminate the entire slide and the Scangear software allows you to save color correction settings speeding up the process of scanning these very old slides, most of which have very faded cyan dyes making the slides extremely ""red"".  I figure it will take a couple of days to scan the 600 or so slides and create DVDs for delivery to my customer - a job that would have been torturous in the extreme using single slide scanners.\n\nI'm very happy with this scanner.";Scanning medium format mounted positives
47;71.0;1.0;9.0;-115.25105726872242;When I was shopping for a scanner and saw the mentions of bloatware, I didn't give it much thought. I thought no big deal. Well, if you're using this for basic office functions (meaning, you're not an artist with specialized or high graphics quality needs), think twice before buying it.\n\nHere's one example. It persists in saving output in a MUCH larger size than the original. An 8.5 x 11 page ends up 12.25 x 15, what's up with that? Scanning a simple B&W 28 page pdf contract of which the original size was 250kb, results in a 21 MB file -after zipping it. How am I going to email that? I had to upload it to my server and send the link to the intended recipient so they could download it. It's stupid.\n\nSo you'd think this would be a simple matter of fiddling with the scanner settings, no? I'm with you on that but just TRY finding them. That's when you discover that the software is but a thinly disguised IQ test, designed to measure persistence, iteration strategy and cunning. And Help or support? Don't make me laugh. That's how I ended up here today.\n\nIf you need a basic machine, select something else that's user friendly.;Good luck finding how to change the settings!

You do have to fiddle with some of the images in Photoshop (I didn't use the accompanying software), mostly to lighten or darken general exposures, but that would be the same in a dark room or machine printing--every exposure is different and has it's own perfect ""formula""--so I don't count that as a negative by any means.  In fact, comparing the images I got from scanned negs versus vintage prints from the same negs (our family camera shot 120mm), I'd have to say the scanned images are superior and show more detail!

I have well over 1500 of them going back 65 years ago when I was in high school.\n\nI made my own negative holder from a piece of cardboard which lets me line up to scan 4 negatives at a time.  The 3 1/8 X 10 1/2 light gave me adequate room to do this.\n\nI'm scanning at a 300 DPI, which I find is more than adequate for displaying on my computer and occasionally making some 4 x 6 prints. It takes me less than a minute per negative, so it doesn't take forever.  I doubt I would ever want anything much larger, but if I did, I can always ratchet up the dpi, and of course the scanning time would take longer.\n\nIt took me a few tries to discover how to set up the Canon Navigator program --- click on Scan Film, check off the ""use scanner drives"" box, click on Open Scanner Driver, and make selections on the right of the screen. I can then preview the scan and click & drag boxes around the parts of each negative I want to capture. After the first several tries, I found it all really is pretty intuitive.\n\nThe documentation could be vastly improved by letting you print out the entire help file without crawling thru it one section at a time.  I do much better with a printed copy than with on-screen help, but perhaps it's just a habit of old age.\n\nI tried a few of my 35mm slides, and even with them the scanning time is reasonable, since I'm never going to blow them up larger than 4 x 6 prints --- I'm doing all this for archive purposes and not for salon quality.\n\nI also have made good use of the ocr features of the bundled OmniPage.  While I haven't used it yet, it's nice to have the bundled Photoshop Elements 5 -  more than adequate for my needs.

23;75.0;5.0;7.0;-125.11626794258372;I purchased this scanner to fulfil my New Years' resolution to digitalize all my photographs & negatives. This scanner serves both purposes well. I unpacked the equipment and loaded the software on my computer. Within 30 minutes I was loading negative strips into the cartridge and scanning them. Viola. It was that easy. I like that I can load as many as 12 negatives at a time. I also like that I get a preview of the negatives and can select which ones I actually want to scan and save. This saves time because it takes about one minute(ish) per negative to scan. After scanning I have the opportunity to modify, adjust, or change the digital picture file or save it. Saving the files is easy too. You can use the generic name the program provides or change the name. With two labradors supervising my project, I have discovered that a soft cloth and a can of air is helpful to keep hair out of the negative cartridge.

It was purchased to replace an Epson scanner that had begun to fail. This Canon has been working very well for me for scanning both photos and documents.\n\nI am not particularly impressed with its software; it gives few options when scanning to create pdf's and its options for photo scanning are a bit frustrating. I have worked around most of the issues; for instance, I scan documents to jpg then convert them to pdf's. I would have preferred to not have the extra step, but it still works. (12/3/2009 update: this method, while a bit tedious & cumbersome, still works the best. Using Canon's MP Navigator software to scan directly to pdf format leaves much to be desired in output quality as the included PhotoStudio software has no ability to manipulate pdf's. Doing it my way allows much greater control of the output. Anyone having access to PhotoShop can avoid this issue as PS has the ability to work with .pdf files. As I do have PS, it's a bit of a tossup as it takes longer to load than does PhotoStudio.) ***(9/8/2010 update: using Adobe Acrobat, I can now scan directly into pdf format with good results. The WIA choice seems to work better than TWAIN. I routinely use +3 for brightness and +10 to +12 for contrast to most closely duplicate the original - for both 'color' and 'grayscale' results. This creates pdf files of smaller size than those obtained by starting with jpg images. I continue to be satisfied with this scanner.)\n\nWhile it may be that I just haven't been able to find the right controls, I have found no way to 'permanently' set the software to file to a particular directory of my choice or to NOT try to create a subdirectory for the scanning day's date.(12/3/2009 update: Have found how to do this using the Preferences tab on the 'MP Navigator EX' panel provided by the software - easy to do.)\n\nI haven't found the sound level of the scanner to be particularly irritating, either in quality or level, although it might be if I was trying to talk on the phone while it was working or if it was in an office with other people present.\n\nThe scans are high-quality with little artifact due to glare or light-leakage. What little reflection glare there has been I've been able to correct for using the included Photo Studio software. Having the scan light come on so very quickly has greatly decreased the time required for scans. For me the color produced has been at least as true as that produced by my previous scanner, and has worked well for the many photos, b&w and color, that I've scanned with this unit.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Canon-CanoScan-8800F-Flatbed-Scanner/dp/B002FTHKSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Canon CanoScan 8800F Flatbed Scanner</a>\n\nThis scanner appears to be built solidly and constructed well. All parts fit well and feel substantial. Having the top hinged on a long side would have been nice, but that would limit the scanners placement flexibility. I do wish that actual glass, rather than optical plastic, had been used as the scanning surface, but that would have probably increased the price. (12/3/2009 update: While the optical plastic surface is functional, it is harder to keep dust-free and, when a bit of colored ink transferred to it from a magazine page [sounds odd but it happened] I had to be much more cautious using a solvent than had it been glass.)\n\nOverall, while there have been a few issues relating to software flexibility, the scanner is working VERY well for me and its quality of construction absolutely is in line with the high level expected to accompany the Canon name.\n(12/3/2009 update: I remain very satisfied with the overall quality and function and quality of this scanner - the only thing I would really change is the plastic scanning surface - to glass.)";Works well for me

It does a much better job than my old HP Scanjet 3970.\n\nI am wondering if the negative reviews might not be, in some cases, a result of not following the instructions.  If, for example, one does not remove the white protective sheet from the scanner cover [which is needed for scanning photographs and other documents] then your slides and negatives will be reproduced very dark, too dark for normal reproduction.  Also, if you connect the scanner first and then load the software by inserting the CD that comes with the scanner, you will normally not have a proper setup.  I found it very easy to setup the machine and almost immediately produce quality slide and 35mm negative scans.\n\nBy the way, for the one who complained that his slides were square and didn't neatly fit into the slide holder supplied, I have over 10,000 slides from over 30 years of photography [1962 to 1998] and they are all rectangular.

I have used the Photo Studio utility to correct the fading from 30 year-old pictures as well as to lighten photos that were too dark.  Scanning and saving photos through Photo Studio takes longer, and you have to remember to include the .jpg extension when you save a scanned photo in order to open it in Finder or IPhoto (for you Mac users.)  The Canon Utilities program can scan several photos at once and separate them.  There is some limited editing capability in this program, but it works best if you want to scan a bunch of photos that don't need editing and they are automatically saved with the .jpg extension.  You can also select to save as a PDF file, and I prefer scanning documents with the Canon versus my 3 in 1 printer.  You can save multiple pages in one file or several.

Reading reviews on Amazon and elsewhere lead me to believe a much less expensive alternative might do the job. I have been more than pleased with the Canon 8800F. Like many others, I gave a lot of weight to scan speed. At a resolution of 2400 dpi it takes about four minutes to scan a batch of four slides but the limiting factor is the time it takes to pull the slides from their carousels and replace them after scanning so the scan time is not as great a factor as I thought and you would be amazed at the number of four minute chores you will find around the house while the scanner does it's thing. I don't use the scanning software to enhance the  images at all but wait until a large batch is scanned and then use either the Arcsoft or Photoshop Elements software that came bundled with the scanner to make modifications.

96;89.0;4.0;9.0;-286.7105929919137;"Though Epson scanners continually get good reviews for their image quality, I have found Epson software to be balky, and image quality to be inferior to the equivalent Canon unit. I haven't tested every model out there, but I have both an Epson and a Canon scanner at my office, and the Canon always produces better results even though it is a cheaper model than the Epson. The headaches caused by the Epson's software gives the Canon an even bigger advantage. When it came time to purchase a scanner for my home, going with the Canon was a no-brainer. The first thing to consider about the 8800 is its size. Obviously, all scanner sizes are determined by the size of the plate, but the 8800 is also a fairly tall unit. Opening the door requires a fair amount of room, and you'll want to measure first if you're considering a shelf mount. My 8800 shipped with Canon's version of Photoshop, which includes most of the basic features the amateur will need. It also came with Photoshop Elements 5.0, which contains a few more advanced features, but is not designed to run natively on Intel-based Mac computers. Put simply, if your Mac is about two years old or newer, the supplied copy of Photoshop will run slowly. Otherwise, the supplied software works well--one of the most convenient features is when you are scanning slides, the software automatically recognizes and separates the individual frames in preview mode, allowing you to pick and choose which ones to scan. The scanning quality is the best I've ever experienced (though I only have tried cheaper scanners than this one), and it does well with film negatives, slides, and prints. The only odd results I've gotten are with semi-gloss finishes such as prom pictures--white ""sparkles"" appear possibly as a result of some kind of reflection. There are a million settings to play with, and hopefully one will sort out that issue. Scanning speed seems fairly slow, but I suppose this is the price to pay when using the extremely high resolution settings the 8800 is capable of. For less than $200, it's hard to imagine wanting much more.";An excellent (though big) all-around scanner
28;90.0;4.0;6.0;-123.54642857142854;I'm a fine art photographer that has sent lots of old black and white negatives to various scanning services in recent years. The cost of these services really adds up over time! Sometimes I run into an old negative that I'd like to scan, but it's impractical to send a single negative to a scanning service. I decided to buy this scanner because, at around $160, it seemed like an exceptional value compared with the cost of sending small amounts of work out to be scanned.\n\nAfter scanning numerous black and white 35mm and 6x6 negatives (and some 35mm color transparencies) with the Canon 8800F, I'm very impressed with the results. I don't believe that the results are quite as good as can be obtained from a professional scanning service or a dedicated film scanner, but a little working with the tone curve in an editing program can greatly improve the results. I'm using Hamrick Software VueScan with this scanner, software I can recommend and that fully supports the capabilities of this scanner, including infrared dust removal and multiple scans.\n\nThe machine is very well constructed, definitely a cut above most flatbed scanners I've seen in this price range. Highly recommended!;A Good Machine

Using the 4 slide caddy made the job move fast with great quality. Using a higher DPI than the default slowed things down a bit but patience is rewarded with a great looking scan even corrected for fading. Being able to walk away while it did 4 slides at once was cool.\n\nFor prints, it was really fast using 300DPI and it was able to detect multiple prints on the platen and tscan.

59;93.0;5.0;7.0;-90.2065789473684;I had read some of the reviews regarding set-up issues before purchasing and was a little concerned, but there was no reason to be. I was able to set up the scanner very quickly - it does pay to read the quick start setup instructions and load the scanner software BEFORE plugging the scanner into your PC. I usually read the instructions when all else fails, but caught this important detail when I happen to read the quick start guide first. After the install of the software and connection of the scanner to the PC, all you have to do is turn on your scanner, put a photo on the glass, open the software, select the source (the scanner name - very explicit in the instructions) and acquire your first image. I have Windows Vista 64Bit version and had no driver compatibility issues. It scanned the first photo smoothly with no hitches.\n\nI haven't used it for scanning negatives yet (the intended purpose of the purchase) but so far it's been a great purchase.\n\nAs mentioned elsewhere, it is a full size scanner.

Big mistake.\nIt is a very flimsy piece of 'equipment'.\nAs I opened the box I heard something in the box that made me suspicious.\nSomething was moving. As I took out the scanner I heard another bang.\nThere is a locking mechanism that is supposed to keep the scanner head immobilized. Well the lock broke, because it was shifting from left to right.\nI still decided to follow the instructions and install the software. I plugged in the scanner, made sure the scanner was in the 'unlocked' position, and tried to scan an image. I got an error message that the scanner was locked. No it wasn't. I could not even lock it if I tried. It only remained in the 'unlocked position'.\nI am very disappointed.;Worst purchase ever!

The flimsy plastic film guide is coming apart - it's a little tray that holds the negatives while the negs are being scanned.  Canon doesn't stock them and I can't find them anyplace online.  What do I do when the guide gets really broken?  I don't know.  I started wishing I had bought extra film guides when I bought the scanner, but I notice that Canon doesn't sell extras on their website for their newer scanners.  I called Canon and was given a number to call.  I called it, and the people were very courteous (and American), but Canon doesn't have the 4400 guide at any location.  If you buy this scanner under which this review sits, I'd make sure you buy a bunch of the crappy little film guides too.;POSSIBLY FLIMSY PLASTIC PART THAT WILL BREAK
63;97.0;5.0;7.0;-64.14965116279068;I bought this because of all the positive reviews here on Amazon. It worked great with my Mac Pro (Early 2009) and 10.5.6. It scans ALMOST as good as the Polaroid SprintScan 120 I had years ago. That was a $2200 machine and it was using Silverfast that had profiles for different film stock. With this scanner and it's software you will definitely have to do a bit of color correction depending on your tolerance for color casts. I scanned black and white negs, color negs, and transparencies in 35mm and 120 film. Hopefully your 120 film is FLAT. It will help because film holder will hold the film for you but it's not going to do much to flatten it. 35mm film does not seem to be affected as adversely as the 120, but for $180 it cannot be beat. This item does not need my review but I am so pleased with the value of this machine I felt I had to write something about it.;Mac users look no further
19;98.0;4.0;5.0;-1439.937444152431;We decided to digitalize some of our old pictures. I have an Agfa SnapScan 1212u and love it. But after a few hours of scanning, it's showing its age. The scans take a long time and progress was definitely limited by 90s technology. So I did a lot of research on the web. It seemed to come down to two scanners for photo scanning, Canon's CanoScan 8800F and Epson's Perfection V500. Both retail for the same price, but the Epson is much cheaper discounted, including on Amazon. The Epson Perfection V600 is not discounted and I didn't really see a difference between it and the V500 so I never considered it.\n\nBased on the reviews, the 8800F and V500 seemed to be pretty much equivalent. But on most reviews, the Canon usually was the preferred scanner chosen. The overwhelming 5 star reviews on Amazon seemed to support what others on the web were saying. So based on those numbers, I chose the 8800F.\n\nOk, on to my experience. The scanner shipped immediately even though I picked free shipping. Showed up in 3 days from Phoenix. The scanner itself has a slightly larger footprint than my Agfa and not as tall. The lid kind of surprised me. It is thick with some kind of electronics in it. There is a cord in the back connecting the top to the base of the scanner. The top is hinged and cannot expand so it's not really designed to scan books (at least you don't have to worry about copyrighted material). There are a number of scanner function buttons on the front of the lid. I don't plan on using them other than the power button as I prefer to use software to do scanning operations. A minor complaint is that the scanner has to be manually turned on. Maybe there is a way around this, I don't know. My Agfa turned on automatically when I requested a scan. But this is trivial. The unit is the standard black and grey and matches Dell's XPS color scheme. As big as the scanner is, I wish they would put the power brick inside the unit. Other than that, no complaints about the physical appearance of the scanner.\n\nNow for my practical experience. I am running Windows 7 64-bit on a Dell i7 XPS Studio, 12gb ram, 2tb disk space, so no issues on power, memory or storage. Loaded all the software without any problems and did the test scan.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the sound when it scans. It is a very high pitched whine, not loud but a bit irritating to me. On the return there is a noticeable servo whirl sound. This is not a quiet scanner. My wife was working next to me and asked what was that sound. It was that noticeable and unusual. Maybe I'm use to the Agfa's gentle humming sound, but the 8800F will definitely take some getting used to. Our HP 7410 all in one scanner is not as loud or irritating on scans.\n\nThe scans are very fast compared to the Agfa, only a few seconds. Then it goes through a cycle of cropping, sending the scan to a file and finally opening a photo editor. As another reviewer has mentioned, as it cycles through the steps, it interrupts whatever else you may be doing. I was going to check my email and when it sent the crop message, it took me out of keying my userid. I went back and keying in my password it bounced me out again to tell me it was saving the image. Then it started the photo editor and bounced me to that screen. I think they need to work on this irritating feature.\n\nThe scans. I have mixed feelings here. I tend to put several pictures on the scanner and do one scan. For whatever reason, on some scans it only returned 3 of 5 pictures scanned. On others, it failed to separate the pictures and I got 3, 2 or 1 scan for the 5 pictures in various combinations. The pictures were separated so there shouldn't have been any issue.\n\nIt also put a white edge to some pictures. The pictures being scanned are all borderless. But sometimes there is a white border on an edge. It doesn't seem to have deleted anything so I just crop it off in the editor.\n\nOther times there is a slight white edge added on a corner with a matching white edge on the opposite corner, like the picture isn't straight. But the software is suppose to handle this and it does most of the time but sometimes not. I got in the habit of only doing 3 pictures at a time to avoid these issues but it still does it even then. Two of three will be fine. It's the third one that has an issue, sometimes even scanning one picture has the problem. A few times I removed the good scans and rescanned the third picture without even moving it and it comes back fine on the rescan. Bit of a mystery here.\n\nThe included software. The box says it is Windows 7 capable so I am guessing this is a current model of the scanner, not one from 3 years ago. I normally check for a trademark date, but there isn't one on the box. Well the included default editor is ArcSoft PhotoStudio 5.5 and after the scan it tries to open it. First thing it says is 'compatibility issues with your version of Windows'. Great. Don't know if its Windows 7 or 64 bit. Went to the ArcSoft site and there it says PhotoStudio is now Windows 7 compatible. Unfortunately that is in version 6. Well if you ignore the warning the application does launch and you can use it. But I am cautious when it says it is not compatible. Who knows what may happen or if it crashes after spending an hour fixing a picture. You can change the default photo editor easily so it isn't a big deal but something included that isn't useful for me.\n\nAdobe PhotoShop Elements is also included. It doesn't seem to have any issues, but it is version 5. The current release is version 8. I don't mind being a version or two behind, but 3 versions old? I saw a review of the v500 that said they are shipping with version 7. Maybe Canon couldn't work out as good a deal with Adobe. I use Microsoft's Digital Image Suite for 90% of my photo editing, it's simple and does what I need. I also have the full version of Adobe PhotoShop so it isn't an issue. But another useless software that I won't use. Photoshop Elements 4.0 for Macintosh is also included for you Apple users out there.\n\nThe only other software that may be useful is ScanSoft OmniPage SE OCR. But I already have and use Readiris Pro 12 so I haven't tried the included OCR. I guess there are other programs included but I'm not real familiar with them and probably won't use them.\n\nI went back to re-read the reviews on the scanner. It was then I noticed most of the reviews for both the 8800F and the V500 seem to be more focused on scanning negatives and slides. I may have been mistaken in selecting this scanner for just scanning old pictures. I tried scanning color negatives and it does a great job there. But be aware, it is very, very slow compared to regular photo scans. The scanning window said it would take 7 minutes to do 4 pictures. It did take a while, I don't think 7 minutes, but a very noticeable amount of time. The white pad on the lid must also be removed and the negative holder (35mm) looks like it will only hold 4 strips. My main purpose is for photos and maybe the occasional negative so this isn't an issue.\n\nOverall I guess I am pleased with the scanner. It is fast for picture scanning and the scans appear fine. It works for what I got it for, picture scanning and speed. The scans are a bit softer than the prints and the color and exposure are a bit off, but I'm sure these can be corrected with software settings and definitely with a photo editor. I will keep it rather than return it to try the Epson. But I cannot in good conscience recommend it as highly as others. The short comings in the software alone need to be noted. I'm sure the Epson is just as accurate in the scans and has its own issues. I sought a perfect solution to all my scanning needs and got a little less than that. Maybe my expectations are too high.;Probably as good as it gets, for now.
87;99.0;5.0;8.0;-167.25891050583652;"I've been using the CanoScan 8800 Series F with Mac OS 10.5 longer than a month now, and I'm absolutely delighted with it's operation as well as the results. Though this product represents my first purchase of any flatbed scanner, I couldn't imagine being more pleased with another product. The following observations may be helpful to new users.\n\n1. The updated driver for Mac OS 10.5 now ships with this product. But, if perchance you didn't receive it, visit the product description on the Canon web site for your area and you'll conveniently find what you need under the tab called ""Drivers & Downloads.""\n\n2. I experienced a learning curve in the use of this product. For example, there seems to be three distinct options for controlling the scanner: (a) by using one of the seven buttons on the scanner itself, (b) by using the ""MP Navigator XP"" software from Canon as a controller, or (c) by using a modified version of PhotoStudio from ArcSoft. Each method offers its own advantages. Try all three of them to determine your preferences, but avoid using more than one of them at the same time.\n\n3. For optical character recognition with exceptional accuracy rates in excess of 99.5%, I recommend scanning documents with a resolution of 600 dpi and reading them with OmniPage Pro X from ScanSoft. However, more casual users of this scanner may be completely satisfied with the version of OmniPage SE that unexpectedly came with mine.";Delighted
132;100.0;4.0;9.0;-3.257113402061819;I purchased the CanoScan 8800F to scan in a multitude of 35mm slides and film negatives that I wanted to share with family for Christmas.  It did a fine job, averaging about 2 to 2 1/2 minutes per image at 2600 dpi (or in that range).  Easy to use and operate, though the software requires more disk space and includes more 'extras' than I would prefer (which is true of most equipment software).  I can strongly recommend the 8800F to any photo buff -- this is well designed and built equipment, especially for slides and film strips.;Got the Job Done!
20;101.0;5.0;5.0;-821.0008590308369;"This is a well-designed product. Easy to use, fast, reliable, nice-looking.\n\nHere are its best features:\n\n1.

E-Mail\n\n  This button scans a smaller version, then automatically opens a New E-Mail window.\n  Just type your message, then click Send.\n\nPressing a button on the scanner not only starts the scanning process, but opens the software interface on the computer. This can come in handy, as mentioned below. There is an option place several scans into a single PDF file. I find this very useful.\n\nThis is NOT a small scanner (it's nearly a foot wide and 1 1/2 times that deep). But it's the best I've found. Fast startup, reasonably quick scanning, great quality, and usable software. The LED lighting really makes a difference. I hate waiting for scanners/copiers to warm up. And with this scanner, there is no wait. Even if you leave it off, from the time you press the On button, it pops up its interface on the computer and is ready to scan in 5 seconds. Press Scan Photo and in 15 more seconds, your scan is waiting for you in Photoshop (assuming Photoshop is already running):\n  * 3-5 secs to begin scanning once a button is pressed\n  *  6 secs to scan the image/document\n  * 2-3 secs to transfer it to the computer\n\nThe software could be better:\n\na) It could be better named.\n  It's difficult to remember that it's called ""MP Navigator"". I find myself hunting for it every time I want to bring up the software interface manually. What was that called again...? Searching for ""scanner"" or ""8800"" in your Windows 7 Start menu, for example, won't find it. So create a Shortcut to it named ""Scanner"" so you can easily find it when you want to complete a scan without walking over to the scanner.\n\nb) It brings up a modal dialog before/during scanning (!)\n\n  Each time a scan is started, the scanner software comes to the front, intercepting any keyboard input.\n\n  This is very annoying if you're trying to work in the background while scanning. For example, if you're retouching one image while scanning the next, a moment after the Scan button is pressed, you will be switched out of Photoshop and the Scanner software panel comes to the front, telling you that scanning is in progress and not to lift the lid. Hello??! Isn't that obvious? This is not a loud scanner, but you can *definitely* hear the mechanism moving and know when it is scanning v.s. when it has finished.\n\n  I do not know a way around this, which means that I cannot edit in the background uninterrupted while new images are scanned and brought into Photoshop.\n\nCanon should supply an option to NOT bring the MP Navigator software to the front after it is initially opened. I'd rather have no interface displayed at all (since I have it set to send all ""Photo"" scans to Photoshop. But it is nevertheless sometimes useful to have the interface available. Why? The front panel of the 8800f actually has 7 scan buttons (!). 3 for different types of PDF plus 1 to complete a multi-page PDF document. So if you're sitting at your desk and realize that there are no more pages, you can just click the ""complete PDF"" button on your computer's software panel, then immediately e-mail it, without having to walk back over to the scanner first. (This happens more often than you'd think.)\n\nTo e-mail a single scan, there is a button labeled ""E-MAIL"". It just places the scan in your outbox, if your e-mail program isn't set to send immediately. In that case, you'll subsequently need to open Outlook and click Send to get it to go out immediately.\n\nPhoto scan quality is excellent. It will scan to a file, or directly to Photoshop. Whitespace around the image is nicely automatically eliminated.\n\nBut there are sometimes issues with clipping a portion of the photograph when it's pushed up against the left side. I've had better luck with aligning the image on the right edge, but saw it happen once there, as well. Maybe the software sometimes gets a little aggressive with the auto-trimming. When it happens this can be very annoying, if you're scanning an entire page and can't move it around much on the bed of the scanner to get a clean scan. But it seems to happen only rarely, and everything else about this scanner works so flawlessly that I'm overlooking it for now.\n\nAll scanners should work this well. But they don't.\n\nSo clear some desk space and get ready for your most pleasant scanning experience in this price range to date.";Best Flatbed, Easy to Use
44;102.0;4.0;6.0;-593.7542921013412;"I give the product a 4 out of 5 overall star rating primarily for it's scanning quality/capability and flexibility particularly when you consider the price point at which it is offered. It doesn't get that additional 1 star due to some of it's shortcomings. Even at the 4/5 rating, it is an excellent product - esp. when you consider what comperable flatbed scanners or specialized slide/negative scanners cost.\n\nProduct was purchased primarily to scan in old slides and prints. The quality of scanned images from slides were excellent. The ability to scan in 4 slides at a time using the provided template is very handy. I was pleasantly surprised at the resolution of each scan of each individual frame. At the highest resolution setting, the scan time is quite long but yields details not seen by the naked eye (e.g. every spec of dirt on the original slide is 'faithfully' captured - for that reason it is suggested that users make sure your slides/negatives are carefully cleaned before scanning). When printing to common 4"" x 6"" sized paper, lower resolution is probably sufficient and reduces scan times. Higher/highest resolution is recommended for larger prints - e.g. 8.5"" x 11"".\n\nWhen scanning prints, CanoScan is very adept at detecting the number of prints on the glass surface (4 maximum) including correcting for misalignment - i.e. prints do not have to be 'perfectly' square on the surface, the software recognizes if/when a print is misaligned and makes the proper orientation correction (though if the glass surface had been exactly 8.5"" wide and 11"" long, it would have made print placement much easier - as it is, some care needs to be exercised so prints are not cut off when scanned). The resolution of print scans is a bit disappointing. It had been hoped that it would scan as well as it scans slides but the maximum resolution appears to be 600 DPI. A very useful feature of the software is that when multiple prints (4 maximum) are scanned in at the same time, the software optionally detects and discerns individual images and saves them into separate files.\n\nThe software's user interface design is perhaps not the most intuitive but once learned it is acceptable. It saves scanned images in .BMP format in temporary folder of user's choice. Before saving to permanent location in some alternate format (e.g. GIF, JPG, etc.), scanned images may be rotated or mirrored (handy when slides are inadvertently improperly oriented) in their native format while still in preview mode. The most annoying aspect of the software, amongst others, is that it is not very flexible in allowing the user to select wider ranging file names.\n\nThe product is very energy efficient - 18W scan mode, 1.5W idle mode. The use of LED does make the product turn on faster, less costly for long term standby, and less likelihood of incurring problems with the light source - both top and bottom.\n\nCANON decided to use a clumsy fat cable to connect the lid/cover to the base. It is unfortunate CANON did not use an integrated flat ribbon cable instead that would not otherise get snagged. The lid/cover stays firmly in place when opened 90 degrees - at least while new. Over time my concern is that it may not stay in place which would make it difficult to use when negotiating slides/negatives/prints and may be difficult/costly to tighten up.\n\nThe product accepts and is capable of scanning up to 8.5"" x 11"" source material (it is unclear why the glass surface is larger than that). For that reason, the product may be considered somewhat large and bulky. It sits 4"" high as well. Given its inherent bulky nature, it is unfortunate that CANON did not design it so it might accommodate legal sized documents up to 14"" long - an additional 3"" would not have made too much difference.";Canon CanoScan 8800F Film/NegativePhoto product review
21;103.0;5.0;5.0;-209.4759395973154;"I have been using this scanner to digitalize 35mm slides - mostly Kodachrome with a few Anscochrome and Ektachrome. I have done about 400 so far and am very pleased with the results. These slides are 40 to 50+ years old and were shot with an inexpensive, manual-adjust camera. Needless to say there have been plenty of focus and exposure problems present in most.\n\nWith a decent quality slide, The results were very good. The dust and scratch removal in Scangear (Canon's Twain progran) worked fine on most slides. Occasionally a few specks remained at reduced level, but these were easily removed in Photoshop E-5 included with the scanner. The Kodachrome slides sometimes exhibited slightly elevated blues in the dark areas after digitalizing. I was able to correct most of this in Photoshop. The Ansco slides all seemed to be poor quality - very grainy and with poor resolution.\n\nSlides with slightly poor focus and exposure were corrected in Scangear and/or Photoshop (with a Focusmagic plug-in). Here again I was very pleased with the final results. For most slides, I prefer Focusmagic instead of USM to improve sharpness. To my eye the fine detail looks slightly more natural with it. I leave Scangear's USM off. Since I am only concerned with future 4 X 6 prints, an occasional 8 X 10, or video display viewing; I adjust the scan for 4 X 6 at 300 dpi (1800 X 1200 ppi).\n\nI have had no experience with high quality Nikon scanners or with the Epson series, so I can't compare this Canon with them.

Lots of cool features to eliminate red-eye, scratches, etc...\nQUALITY:\nPerfect!\nISSUES:\n#1 When you are using the One Click (which is a cool feature), the progress dialog box pops up at every frame, and effectively prevents you from using your computer while you are scanning, because when the dialog pops up, if you hit Enter or the spacebar it will cancel the operation.\nThis does not happen when using the custom scan via the Navigator (which provides more options, but could be slower).\n#2 The software sometimes makes mistakes detecting the frame boundaries. I have noticed this happens whenever the negative has some empty space on one end. If I scan two perfectly cut sets of 4 frames each, there's no problem. So I usually scan those using One Click, and then scan the ends using the custom scan option (aka Scanner Driver).\n#3 Any little hair or speck will be noticeable when scanning film. Be careful to keep your work area really clean while scanning.;Really nice quality scanner with minor issues
51;107.0;2.0;6.0;-43.02468531468527;I have a Mac and I love my iPhoto program.  This scanner does scan beautifully and scans slides well but it uses Adobe Photoshop as its companion and that just hasn't adapted well to my iPhoto program.  I can make it work but I actually have to use 2 or 3 extra steps to get the program to pass the finished product over to iPhoto and not Adobe Photoshop.  The Adobe just takes up computer space that I'd rather use for other things.  HP seems to adapt itself better to Apple products, at least in my experience.  Adobe has never been the easiest program for me to use but I'm sure there are many people out there who are comfortable with it and, if you are, I think you will be really pleased with the performance of the Canon Canoscan.;not easy for me
119;108.0;4.0;8.0;24.739397590361477;For the price, I think this scanner would be very hard to beat.  It does a good job scanning 35mm slides, 4 at a time at up to 4800 dpi resolution, but takes about a minute a slide.  It scans photos, again 4-5 3x5 or 4x6 at a time, at whatever resolution you want and takes less than a minute to do all of them, saving each image as a separate file, if you space them out a bit on the scanner window.;an excellent scanner
75;109.0;5.0;7.0;-48.15205882352939;I wanted a dedicated scanner to use especially for slides. After scouring to web for comparisons and user ratings I decided to get this one. I was concerned that CanoScan 8800F doesn't utilize ICE 3 technology for scratch and dust removal but rather, uses their own proprietary FARE 3 technology . In the final analysis, Canon probably decided not to pay for the ICE 3 licensing but Canon's FARE 3 technology does do the job very well. In fact, in a side by side comparison, I found, after sifting through endless web pages, that the Canon with FARE 3 rendered a bolder, more eye-catching image than Epson's, which uses ICE 3. I guess it's a matter of aesthetic judgement. I highly recommend this unit based on price, features and most of all...results.;CanoScan 8800F is a winner!
25;110.0;5.0;5.0;-503.3422934232715;"I bought this scanner several months ago.  I am only giving it five stars because I don't have the option for six.  I had an old scanner, which served me well for the better part of a decade, but I was curious to see if technology had improved enough to warrant an upgrade.  The reviews, including many here, seemed to point to the CanoScan 8800F.  I was particularly intrigued, and a little skeptical about the slide and negative scanning features.  I had long believed that I could get either a flat-bed scanner or a slide-negative scanner ($$), but not both in one device.  As an avid amateur photographer I have thousands of old photos, most as prints and negatives, but also many slides, left over from my pre-digital life.  I have wanted to archive a subset of images from each year, especially pictures of my kids, but my old scanner was slow, and I was rarely satisfied with the image quality.\n\nThe 8800F is everything I need.  Image quality from prints is far better than I expected.  Many of those I wish to archive are 4x6 snapshots of my kids growing up.  I will archive mostly from prints, since it is easier, very fast (scan time about 7 seconds at 300 dpi) and the quality is surprisingly good.  For my favorite shots, I will make occasional negative or slide scans for maximal quality.  You should be aware that scratches and dust show up well on high-resolution negative and slide scans; on some of them I have a few minutes worth of after-scan retouching work to do.  Negative and slide scans take an extra minute to set up and are slower to scan (1 minute to scan one frame at 2400 dpi), but the fact that I can do it at all makes me happy.  I may scan some negatives at 1200 dpi (about 30 seconds per frame).  Even at that resolution the image quality is pretty good.  Be sure to make note of step 1 in the Scanning Film instructions.  The protective sheet (white panel inside the lid) must be removed before scanning transparencies, otherwise the film guides won't seat correctly.  It will be obvious once you have done it the first time.  As far as scan time goes, not sure how much it matters, but I have a fast computer with lots of RAM.\n\nI have read some criticisms about color rendition with this scanner, but I just can't see a significant color problem with any of my scans so far.  To my eye it looks just fine.  I installed only the ScanGear driver and none of the third party software, as I prefer to scan and edit in Photoshop Elements.  I usually use scan under the Advanced tab, since that gives me more options.\n\nSide note: A couple years ago I tried an on-line scanning service.  It was not expensive, and results were acceptable, but it took months before my images were ready.  When you factor in the time commitment to scan and retouch a lot of slides and negatives, the do-it-yourself approach is probably not worth the cost savings.  For me it came down to a desire to get the scan I wanted, when I wanted it, and I don't mind a little work to get it done.  It's fun to rediscover some of the old images and once they are scanned I am reminded to share them too.\n\nBottom line: The 8800F is a great value.  No regrets on this purchase.";Highly Recommended
26;111.0;5.0;5.0;-91.98499999999999;"OK, I looked at a half dozen slide digitizers (my primary task) that were right around a hundred bucks - forty percent or so cheaper than this one. I also (briefly) fantasized about a ""real"" slide digitizer - at eight or ten times the price of this one. And, of course, I looked at the commercial operations - not a logical approach when you've got (literally) thousands of slides that you would like to move onto disks. Well, based on a dozen or so reviews (some similar to my own) I purchased the Canon Canoscan 8800F; and, you know, I am pleased. [Aside: I purchased a work site table saw for my home shop that a couple of professionals had dismissed as unsuitable for their usage. ""OK for 'weekend warriors,' but not good enough for 'real' work."" Man! For THIS Weekend Warrior that saw is as sweet as it gets. I love it!

I have researched scanners extensively and I think this is the best scanner you can buy without spending over a thousand dollars. It's a real bargain and will give you professional results. I have owned mine for almost two years and I love it. Still use it often to save magazine articles, photo prints, documents, and a number of other things.\n\n*** UNRELATED OFF TOPIC COMMENT*** - Be warned that many big dollar purchases I have made from Amazon, LLC have come with very little inner box padding or packing material. They shipped my scanner bouncing around inside a big box with no padding. It bounced around so much it tore the shipping box up.

107;119.0;5.0;7.0;-357.02879049676017;I bought this scanner for speed.  I have a 1,000 photos I want to scan.  My old scanner took about 20-30 seconds (including placing it and removing it) at 300 dpi for a 4x6 photo.\n\nI figured all the Canon scanners would scan photos with good quality, but with a lot of photos to scan, time was the issue.  So I think it is worth the $100 more than the LIDE 90 if I can many hours.\n\nI read the product description which said it scans an 8x10 in 7 seconds.  I actually found that hard to believe.  I found a review on CNET where someone said it is true.\n\nWell, it is.  I actually can't believe how fast it is.  With the one button push and a good work flow, I can scan at least 5 4x6 prints (at 300DPI) a minute and I think I can get it faster.\n\nAlso, the software is better than it used to be.  My old Lide's software was pretty lame.  This software is not great, but it does let you set up some defaults so that you can just scan without having to touch the computer, just a one button push on the scanner and the software places the scanned photos into a folder I specified.\n\nIt was also pretty trivial to set the copy function up.  Now with a one button push I can scan and print a document also without having to touch the computer.  And the scanner is so fast, it is almost like using a real copier.  To bad a document feeder is not an option.\n\nOne last note about software.  There are full versions of Photoshop Elements 4.0 (for Mac) and 5.0 for Windows included.\n\nI've already convinced two of my friends to get one.\n\nUPDATE:\nI just finished scanning in about 1500 photographs.\nAs expected, the process was very fast.  The reality of the situation was I could scan 3 photos a minute at 300 DPI.\n\nThere seems to be a bug in the software for a MAC.  I didn't count exactly, but it seemed like about every 500 pictures, the software would just stop working.  Restarting the software didn't fix the problem, but rebooting the computer did.  So I guess there is a memory leak.  I will report this to Canon.  It was not too much of a big deal having to reboot every 4 hours of this process, but of course it is pretty annoying.\n\nI can't image how long this process would have taken me if I has a slow scanner.  This was one of the best purchases I ever made.  Time savings alone paid for itself.;Speed

Once you're comfortable that you've got your settings right then it's straightforward to scan lots of slides.  You can only do 4 at a time and depending on the scan resolution you're using this can take a long time.  It's a good idea to have something else to do while you're baby-sitting the scanner.\n\nI did find that performing some operations on the PC at the same time as scanning would lock up the software - so be careful especially if you're like me and scan many slides before actually saving them!  You learn quickly to save frequently!\n\nDespite the above annoyances this is a great scanner for the price.

86;128.0;5.0;6.0;-205.91067961165047;I've worn out two flatbed scanners and one parallel port slide scanner over the years.  My sister had purchased the Canon CanoScan 8800F recently and loved it so I took her word and ordered one.  It's is the BEST I could have hoped for.  The 150 dpi setting is FAST!  The 300 dpi setting is very fast compared to my scanners in the past.  The 600 dpi does bog down but I really don't need my routine family photos scanned in this high of a resolution.  So I stick to the 300 dpi pretty much and the scans are excellent quality and color.  The software is amazing.  In the past when I've laid like 4-6 photos on the glass then I've had to separate each of them by cropping and then save.  This software separates the photos for me and I can just zip through saving each one using Ctl-S, putting them all into one folder and then renaming them all using Windows Explore.  The slides are slower to scan but much faster than my previous scanner and the software also separates each slide for me.  Also, if a photo is washed out or fading, the software has some awesome fixes for all sorts of problems.  One B&W that was almost faded out totally was repaired like it had just been developed!  All details could be seen.  So I just can't praise this scanner enough or the software.  I went ahead and purchased the 2-year replacement warranty since I use a scanner a lot but have a feeling this scanner will prove to be hearty!  I also found Amazon.com had the best price on the scanner.  So I'm happy with my purchase and I'm plowing through the family photos and slides so much faster than in years gone by!;Love this scanner

This slows down the whole process tremendously, primarily because the unit doesn't usually want to turn back on for awhile. Sometimes it takes me 20-30 minutes to get the unit to turn back on.

Both involved hundreds of photos; in both cases the photos were in dubious condition. Combined with Photoshop, I was able to work fairly quickly and efficiently, with acceptable results.\n\nSure, I'd like the option of better resolution than 600dpi. Some of the antique photos will be blow up to posters, and Photoshop's interpolation isn't so hot when you're starting with only 600dpi.

The documentation team at Canon seems to have been writing for some other product, in another language. It's nearly useless. The application name - you can't make this stuff up - is MP Navigator EX. After the installer has run, you can spend a long time looking for a program with the name ""Canon."" Silly user, you want ""MP Navigator EX.""

And it's not even slightly scriptable.\n\nBut, while annoying, those are comparatively minor nits. The 8800F (who dreams up these names?) does the job for the majority of scanning projects. And the price in hard to argue with.\n\nRecommended.";Easy to Use, Decent Quality, Affordable Price
115;138.0;4.0;6.0;-11.346638655462144;I got this mainly to scan images from my 120 roll film 6x6 medium format camera (isolette II).  The scanner can do up to 4 frames at a time which is great because it takes a while.  Another cool feature it the ability to pick the frames to scan from a preview scan (save time by not scanning bad shots).  The scanner can do 12 35mm (135 film roll form my Minox 35) frames which is a great time saver.  This scanner is also a flat bed document scanner so it is pretty big.  I was hopping for a smaller unit.  The scan quality is great.  You can not beat the price.  Works great with OS X 10.5;Excelent 120 film roll scans
117;139.0;5.0;6.0;-412.7424103585657;I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase of the CanoScan 8800F and the companion printer Canon PIXMA IP4500.  I bought both items sight unseen after reading the raving reviews of other owners.  They were not wrong -- they are in my estimation the best on the market. Everything works flawlessly. The manufacturer has simplified their operation to the point that the scanner and printer can both be used equally well by either the Novice or the Professional. I find that the scanner default settings meet my current needs, but it is comforting to know it has the capability to expand according to my future personal experience.\n\nI now feel that I have the perfect photography solution where I can take a slide or print, process it in Photoshop Elements 5 which is included with the 8800F scanner, and print a professional looking photograph on the excellent IP4500 printer. It is amazing when you compare the original slide or print against the finished product.  My wife, a novice, had trouble with the relatively new HP printer and Epson scanner because they were difficult to use and understand. Also the two different company products did not interface well and did not give the desired end result without a lot of manipulation.  Needless to say they are no longer in our household.\n\nThere is a lot to be said for simplicity and I can see that Canon is taking this very seriously. They are at the forefront by streamling their products for easy use but still giving you the latest high quality hardware, software and technology available.  For example, the 8800F scanner has the latest LED lights replacing the old Fluroescent lamp which is a big improvement. The IP4500 printer reflects this also and gives you everything you would want or need, yet eliminating all the confusing buttons featured on my HP printer (which I never used and was glad to get rid of them). One critic rated the IP4500 printer poorly because of this but I strongly disagree.  It is exactly what I wanted.\n\nAs I use the Canon products I can marvel at all the attention to detail and quality they have shown me. Now I can just relax and enjoy my photograpy knowing that I have the best equipment available for my purposes.\n\nI made the right choice and I hope you will do the same by reading all the reviews before you buy.  Don't buy based on past reputation because some companies have lived on that for far too long. They are now playing catchup but will have a hard time competing with Canon in my book.\n\nI used to be a solid HP fan and still use two very old work horses, the HP IIIP Laser and the DeskJet895Cse, which I love. Now, the mantle has passed and I am in Canon's corner all the way, because they have shown me that they have not given up on quality as others have.;Simplicity and Quality
69;140.0;5.0;5.0;-181.5009090909091;Okay this review is a bit premature as I've only played with the Canon 8800F for a couple of hours but I'm already blown away. The setup is easy and I had no problem installing hardware or software!\n\nI have many old B/W medium format negs (some over 80 years old). Several that are so thin (light) that you can hardly see an image on them---yet I can get a high quality photo image from a scan with this scanner. The biggest drawback is that it is not evident immediately which software one should use for the medium format negs as it is not a choice in a couple of the programs. The key to scanning these larger negatives is to scan from within Arcsoft Photostudio. Select the acquire icon and you are up and running.\n\nI think it will take some time to come up to speed with all the variables but it is easy to use in short order. Some of the other included software (like Mp Navigator)seems designed for ordinary photos and slides and users who want the simplified auto approach. This can be frustrating if you bought this for medium format so go straight to Arcsoft Photostudio---you'll be glad you did.\n\nLike other reviewers I read many reviews before selecting this scanner. I'm very pleased I chose this one. Although a few commented on the noise I found this Canon much quieter than my All in one HP scanner. It is energy star certified and warms up almost immediately. The only drawback is that it will not take negs larger than 120mm.;Better than magic---Read here for medium format users

74;142.0;5.0;5.0;-15.823913043478242;This product is highly addictive! I am an amatuer scanner. I have a box of slides and 35mm negatives which I have wanted to digitalize for years. I bought myself an early Christmas present and went to work. It is helping me accomplish everything I hoped for with 35 years of material. The only problem is that I now wake up at 4:30 am every morning and scan until I leave for work. I come home from work and scan until bedtime. It caused me to have to buy an external harddrive for my computer. My wife thinks I have a girlfriend on-line. Other than these minor issues I rate this Canon scanner A++++!;WARNING!
77;143.0;5.0;5.0;27.797228915662686;Canon CanoScan 8800F Scanner:  I read a bunch of reviews before ordering.  It sounded like it would be easy to use.  I have boxes of old slides and I had thought about having them scanned for me.  I think I have saved quite a bit of money.  I had some slides that I couldn't even tell what they were and with just a few adjustments I can see the pictures.  The programs that come with the scanner are great. Thank you, Sondra;Canon CanoScan 8800F Scanner
79;144.0;5.0;5.0;-69.02968944099378;I had a Nikon Coolpix scanner and it produced fantastic scanned film images but at great expense and time.  I would never live long enought to scan all my film images.  So I tried the Epson Perfection V700 Photo Color Scanner for about $500.  I returned this Epson product because it wouldn't automatically recognize the film images for auto thumbnails.  I then bought the Canon 8800F for only $175 and it is easy to use, produces images just as good as the Epson but at 1/3 the price.  It too fails to automatically recognize the images on 35mm film for thumbmails but it is much easier to just crop what you want from the total film strip produced on your computer screen.  Further, you can easily zoom in on the film strip image to make cropping much easier before you scan.  The software provides an excellent human interface so it is natural to use.  This is a GREAT value.;Great Value

It has even saved me time in photoshop by somewhat accurately adjusting the color for the old and faded shots, not bad!;Not Complainin', so far, so good
103;146.0;4.0;5.0;-48.30469798657714;I hadn't bought a scanner in a number of years - 9 to be precise.  This machine was easy to use right out of the box.  Fast, intuitive setup followed by fast and intuitive use.\n\nIt's nice to not have the long warm up time - want to scan something and its done before you know it.  The software is easy to use and the quality of the result excellent.  While I am not a power user by any means, I was able to scan old family photos with great resolution.  The software allowed me to place multiple photo's on the scanner at once and it recognized and separted each into their own file.  I was able to scan a large deck of pictures in no time at all which allowed me to spend what little time I had putting together a very well received slide show.;Scanner Technology has come a long way....
108;147.0;5.0;5.0;-67.43841463414631;This is a great scanner for the price.  Besides scanning photos much faster than my older Canon scanner, it does a very nice job of scanning slides at up to 4800 dpi.  I came in possession of some old slides that were photos of my grandfather's paintings, which were long since gone.  The slides were positives of what appeared to be a odd size, but are apparently 35mm unmounted slides.  The scanner comes with 3 adapters that allow you to scan any of the mounted 35mm slides, 120 film, or 35mm strips.  In my case, I used the latter and it saved me probably hundreds of dollars of having them scanned at a local Kinko's.  The results are great and the scanner came with all the software for Photoshop on my Mac.  A tremendous buy at $199 retail, and even better from Amazon.  Compare this to other slide scanners and it is less than half the price of those with comparable performance.;Excellent scanner
109;148.0;5.0;5.0;-74.30948275862066;I have been using this item now for several months and it is irreplacable in helping me archive 25,000+ 35mm negatives, slides and prints from the past 30yrs of shooting.  Many of them not stored properly but now I am in the process of scanning them all to save them and now properly archive them for storage.\n\nThe scanner has been easy to use, like with any product you need to read and learn how to use it and I think Canon isn't too hard to learn in general.\n\nAs for the software I have NOT used it as I use other programs to do my manipulations and corrections, I have used other Canon product software in the past without any issue as it is usually very simple and I had never had problems using their products with XP or Vista and currently I using Vista without issue.\n\nIf you need a stand alone scanner I think this is the best one on the market at the consumer level.;Excellent Scanner Film and Photos

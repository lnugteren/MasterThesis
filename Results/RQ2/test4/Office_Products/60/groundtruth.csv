13;1.0;1.0;178.0;19.04000000000002;"Feeling kinda jipped after looking at my globe. The work seems pretty shoddy with how ""off"" some of the latitude and longitude lines are - not matching up (see pics). I guess I'll have to pretend there was a major earthquake that shifted some of the countries. There was also some threading on the globe where I now have a bare cardboard colored line, pretty annoying. I'd return this if I bought it from a store or had a more serious use for this.";Shoddy Letdown
3;2.0;5.0;5.0;39.52970588235296;Really not much to say.  We're homeschoolers, and use this globe all the time.  It seems well-made.  Great size--not so big you can't sit it anywhere, not so small you can't see anything.  The raised relief is well-done.  I've tried several other globes and been disappointed, so I'm speaking from some experience here.\n\nI would recommend this globe.  It's just . . . good.;Good Globe
27;3.0;5.0;199.0;-72.45642857142855;My husband asked for a World globe for Christmas.  I started looking on the internet to learn about globes and found there were a vast array of globes with many prices according to the product.  I looked at Amazon and went through the various globes offered there, especially, the reviews and ratings of the different globes.  I chose the Explorer Globe because it was what I was looking for -  a basic learning globe with the simple qualities I thought a person would want in a globe that was for educating himself to World geography.  The price was right and it had raised relief with easy to read lettering. It also came with a sturdy stand.  I also liked the advice that this globe could be returned for an updated globe in the future.  When I received the globe is was what I expected.  I would recommend this globe to anyone who wants a good basic globe without all the frills that drive costs up.  My husband was thrilled!;Explorer Globe from Amazon
2;4.0;5.0;169.0;-5.408712871287108;What a great, inexpensive globe.  It's fascinating to watch a child spin a globe - even if they don't seem like they are learning anything, at least they are getting a general idea of the immense size of our world!  Since getting this globe, my 5 year old son has learned about the continents and the oceans, found Australia on his own and pointed out that Antarctica is bigger than the USA.  It seems that the globe gets loose from it's stand somewhat easily, but it is easily tightened.  All in all, a great buy with terrific educational value.;There should be one in every house!
0;5.0;1.0;133.0;49.28528301886795;I would not recommend this globe.  I bought this for my 3rd grader and on the first day of using it, the equator peeled off!!  I thought of keeping it anyway but decided to deal with the hassle and plan on returning it.  It also feels too flimsy and can fall over easily.;Broke first day
4;6.0;4.0;8.0;-41.93147058823527;This is a pretty good globe, to be fair it is a good gift for a child that has an interest in learning about the world, and would like a visual representation.\n\nPros: The globe has a lot of detail, specifically it has the US states. Which is a feature that is not easy to find for mid priced globes. The size is good, so the different regions are relatively easy to recognize, no need for magnifying glass. There are also raised areas to represent mountainous regions which is pretty cool.\nCon: The biggest issue is the huge blue band around the center of the globe which goes through several continents. The product picture show the band, so there was no misrepresentation by the seller, I just didn't realize how prominent it would be.;This is a pretty good globe
17;7.0;3.0;45.0;35.47357142857145;I really want to love this globe 5 stars worth, but we bought this globe for our homeschooling family and I was a bit disappointed with the construction. The top and bottom half are not exactly put together. It is about a cm off. That doesnt seem like a lot, but with small countries or islands it is. For the price paid, I expected it to be lined up correctly.;top and bottom not lined up properly
18;8.0;5.0;47.0;28.419230769230793;Has all major and most minor geographical references - plenty for education through (probably) high school!  My kids and I enjoy finding places mentioned on the news, locating everywhere we've been, and trying to find something new every day.;Great globe for children
6;9.0;2.0;19.0;-54.918855421686715;I know globes are expensive.  I thought for the money this one would work.  It's fair.  A couple of things... There is a small area that looks like it missed coloring during the printing process.  It's a small imperfection, about a 1/4 inch, but the area is just not there.  And there are some letters missing from the representation. Also, the globe just doesn't appear to be well made.  The stand looks cheap and the printed paper is not lined up well.  The second is that the globe is in Spanish.  I don't think that was mentioned in the description.  Whatever the case, it wasn't glaringly obvious.  I feel like that is a big no no if sellers aren't right upfront.  I have been buying from Amazon for a long time and I have had a few more hiccups in product quality over the past year than normal.  Save your money on this one.  It's not worth it.;Not a w
12;10.0;5.0;22.0;15.513766233766276;The look of this globe is out of this world!  It is bright, colorful, and is profiled to reveal mountain ranges.  There are many other useful features - like shipping routes. It is large enough for a clear view of even some of the tiniest island groupings.  The company also gives you the option of updating your globe at lower cost if their are major political changes on the world map.  It looks great in my den/office.;Out of this world.
23;11.0;3.0;30.0;25.24500000000002;The globe looks great, but the stand doesn't weigh enough.  You have to hold the stand down to turn the globe, otherwise the globe pushes away as you spin it and the spinning is stiff.  It's sitting on my desk and I can only allow students to use it with supervision upon request until I figure out a way to put weight on the bottom--which adds to the price of the globe.  I wish I had known this before purchasing and before I threw away the box. Eek!;Not weighted
11;12.0;5.0;17.0;20.288076923076957;l read some of the reviews before buying this globe and I was skeptical about it especially because I read the Northern hemisphere wasn't aligned with the Southern hemisphere, but when I got it everything was aligned. There was only 1 or 2 longitude/s line that was misaligned but you really have to look for it. It was about a quarter of a centimeter off, not a big deal. Some people I guess had bad luck.;Pretty damn good globe!
29;13.0;3.0;38.0;31.737105263157915;The globe itself is great. My daughter received this for Christmas and she just loves to find different places on her globe. The only problem is the stand. It is just screwed on at the bottom of the stand and we have to keep trying to tighten it up. They really should have made the stand better to with-stand children picking it up and actually using it. Other then the stand it is a great globe.;Stand is a disappointment...
16;14.0;5.0;17.0;23.864285714285735;Perfect school globe. Labeled clearly. Mountain ranges have raised surfaces. Ocean currents marked. Locations clearly and legibly identified.  Just the right size. Save the enclosed coupon to get a free replacement when globe is updated.;Perfect school globe
5;15.0;5.0;6.0;-160.34916317991627;"There is quite a lot of appropriate detail on the globe considering the scale. But the detail is not over-done which can lead to confusion on some maps and globes as ""too much information"" which is really a distraction.  National boundaries are clear and distinct, easy to locate.  Latitude and longitude, the features I was seeking, are distinct and well labeled.  The lines match up. The ocean floor mountain ranges and other land forms are included and are quite interesting.  The globe is mounted on a durable metal stand/frame.  If one wants a globe with up-to-date national boundaries, Replogle offers  discount on a new globe.  Personally I do not find it necessary that a globe contain the latest name or boundary.  Like any map, a globe is a document of changing history.\nI was particularly impressed with the quality and forethought of the internal packaging in the shipping box.  The globe is securely held in place to prevent movement and damage.  The internal packaging will also protect the globe from a good measure of rough handling in shipment.  With this much concern to insure the globe arrives in good condition, I am further impressed with the over-all dedication of Replogle in producing a quality product.\nI am very well pleased with the features of the globe and the high quality of construction.  It is a convenient size for a desk and of course it is easily moved about.";An excellent choice for a globe
22;16.0;2.0;13.0;12.726363636363672;The relief on this globe was off by a good inch when measuring at the equator, meaning mountain ranges were in the wrong places. The stand was pretty wobbly, and it was nearly impossible spin the globe quickly because it was so light and the stand kind of flimsy. If you need a quick globe and don't care about quality, this one would work, but if you want one to keep for years and to be accurate then buy something more expensive and of a different brand.;Low quality globe
7;17.0;4.0;7.0;40.63263157894739;I was pleased with the Globe. I was fearful when ordering it due to some negative comments I read, but I was pleasantly surprised that it looks great. There are a few lines that do not line up perfectly but they are not off by enough to stress over. Overall, for my homeschool classroom, it's perfect.;Pleased with the purchase.
1;18.0;5.0;19.0;49.910000000000025;It's amazing how much a child learns by having access.  We are an American family living in Germany and felt my 5 year old would have a greater understanding of where we live and where our extended family lives.;"12"" Raised Relief Explorer Globe"
10;19.0;5.0;7.0;19.88500000000002;Came well packaged and quality is pretty good.  I wouldn't recommend placing it where it could be pulled off a table or anything since it would likely break, but my young kids love looking at it and putting in perspective where different places are.  I also like explaining day and night to them by turning off all lights in the room except one which represents the sun and then we spin the globe slowly to show day and night.;Happy with this globe
8;20.0;5.0;6.0;11.938202247191043;Was so impressed with this globe when we received it.  Although we purchased it for our grandson for Christmas, we are going to get us one for our home  It is not only beautiful to look at it is intriguing to just stand by it and twirl it around and look at all it has to offer.  I was jealous he was getting it and I wasn't keeping it for us, ha!  Would highly recommend this globe to families, children, or even us older adults.  Very good product!;Impressive!!
26;21.0;4.0;11.0;47.235000000000014;I bought this globe for my 5-year-old son. It is time for him to know the world around him.\nThis globe is almost perfect as educational tool, even you could feel the mountains.\nJust one issue bothers me: its weight. Just 5 lbs, maybe a little light, too easy to fall off the table when you have younger kid around.;wonderful piece
15;22.0;5.0;6.0;30.238955223880623;"Very good globe with excellent print quality.  I am using this as a visual prop for an astronomy talk to explain how seasons and the lunar orbit works.\n\nThe stand, although it feels light weight and ""flimsy"" has handled multiple car trips so far with no damage or weakening that I can see.  Would suggest this model to someone looking at a 12"" globe.  Thank you.";Very good globe with excellent print quality
9;23.0;5.0;5.0;46.65388059701495;"When my granddaughter, age 5, took this globe out of the box, she said ""This is the best day of my life!""  We keep it out so she can peruse it at her leisure.  She continues to ask questions about the countries - we bought a children's atlas to go along with it - that helps quite a bit to clarify the countries and showcase the various people.";"she said ""This is the best day of my life"
14;24.0;5.0;5.0;24.678000000000026;"This is a ""for the price"" review. Good amount of detail for this price point, and same globe as used in higher priced models. It is the cheapest 12"" model with a metal stand that I could find. As pointed out by some others, the assembly quality is indifferent -- not all the lines line up. But it is not as bad as some pictures others have posted here, and the content is still legible enough.";Good amount of detail for this price point
20;25.0;1.0;6.0;-46.80884615384613;We ordered the Explorer English World Globe by Brookstone on August 14 after seeing the globe photo and reading the description and great reviews. Imagine the disappointment to receive a red felt banner instead! We called Brookstone Customer Service expecting a quick resolution to the mix-up, only to be told by Kara that Brookstone does not sell this item on Amazon!! Brookstone offered to refund our purchase price, but refused to honor our original order. We then discovered that the globe photo previously attached to this item has been replaced by a photo of the banner we were shipped. All other parts of the display including description and reviews remain the same, but, trust me, you'll get a banner instead of a globe if you order this Brookstone item.;CAUTION - You're buying the banner, not a globe
19;26.0;3.0;5.0;27.284473684210553;The meridians don't all line up and the equator line was bubbled and coming up in a few places when we received it. It does have a solid base and turns smoothly. In general it is good enough for our small children to learn from. The original listed price of $71.36 would be an outrageous price for the quality of globe, but I bought it for $49.95 which is much closer to reasonable.;Not great, but alright.
21;27.0;5.0;5.0;7.199000000000041;I ordered this globe for my granddaughter for her sixth birthday, since this was one of the main items on her list. She was thrilled to receive it, and couldn't wait to get home and take it out of the box. After that, she made a point of showing us where all the different members of her family live, and where different parts of the world are. She loved the blue oceans and other bodies of water, and was impressed to be able to tell which were the largest and highest mountains by the rsised surfaces on the globe.;"Replogle Explorer 12"" Blue English Globe"
24;28.0;5.0;5.0;41.56629032258067;"My 6-year-old grandson requested this for Christmas.  He and his 8-year-old sister use it often, and it has stood up to their use.  Even the 5-year-old is learning about the world.  Old-fashioned, I know, but we all learned what the world looks like from globes; it's more 3D and touchable than a map or computer.  Good quality at a fair price.";Great learning tool
25;29.0;3.0;5.0;-39.99293103448274;Came in packaged well and easy to assemble in less than a minute (with a Philips screwdriver).\n\nGives good information about latitudes (with highlighted equator), longitudes, political boundaries (slight inaccuracy here because disputed territories, I feel, should be marked so rather than making it a part of one country or the other) and goes to the extent of marking trade winds and their directions.\n\nMay not be sturdy as it is light (some weight on the base could have helped) and has a little overlap error where the map sheath/layer edges meet but, is very good value for money overall.\n\nI specially liked the physical features (mountains) shown by raised relief features.;Handy, usable, portable although slightly inaccurate and can tip easily
28;30.0;5.0;6.0;3.2460000000000377;"This colorful, 12"" diameter globe is well constructed, stands very securely on its stand; is not tippy.  It has very legible lettering, colorful political boundaries and is ""raised relief"" so you can tell where the mountain ranges are.  The children will enjoy using it, and so will Mom and Dad.  No excuses now for not knowing where world events are occurring!  The globe arrived in perfect condition, only 3-4 days after the order was placed.";Very pleased with this globe

Generally, I lose them before they run out of ink but each one of these pens seems to be pretty much DOA. I kept thinking I was picking up the same one or an old one but it's now clear that these are just sub-par quality. Looks like I'll end up throwing these out after a use or two and have to buy more from a local retailer.;I lose them before they run out of ink but each one of these pens seems to be pretty much DOA
32;2.0;4.0;201.0;-231.4270149253731;First, I am in no way an art professional of any type- just a craft/art enthusiast and hobbyist who isn't trying to spend a fortune on supplies.\n\nI purchased these markers with the intent to use them on my new expert level coloring books I had purchased. I have used many sharpies in the past, but never the Ultra Fine tip. I knew that they wouldn't be as fine as some of the fancier art pens out there (Copic), but I was pleasantly surprised when I started to use them at how fine the tip really was.\n\nThey worked wonderfully for my first project in my new book- I tried to use every color just to see what there was, and found that I didn't have any problems with bleeding except on the darkest blue, and even then, it wasn't that bad.\n\nThe ONLY reason that this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because I am disappointed in some of the colors themselves. The picture of the product shows colors that have very light caps- what appear to be sky blue, light pink, lavender, etc. Obviously with a marker, I know that true pastels are very hard to achieve, but these colors were far from pastel at all. On my picture below, you will see on the blue flower, the grey looking color is the lightest blue. And on the purple flower, the grey looking color is the lightest purple. I feel like I got 5 grey markers instead of true pastel colors. Also, the variation of colors is lacking. There are 4 green markers in the set, and as you can see on my frog, I did in fact use all 4 greens, but it is very hard to tell because they came out much darker than the cap would indicate. If you are looking for color variations, I would not order this, but if you need bright, bold colors, then this is your set!;Tip is very fine, but colors are not as the cap shows
30;3.0;3.0;168.0;-52.55233128834354;"Most of the markers work as promised, but with some of them the tips are dried out/ faulty. Of course, the black one was one of them. To fix this I just removed the faulty marker tip and replaced it with one of the working markers tips. But this still leaves me with a tipless marker! I basically have to put a ""working"" marker tip on which marker I want to currently use (such a pain!). Most of the markers seem to work great, but I would recommend testing each one to make sure all of them work.\n\n(Note: Just because a marker tip is dried out DOES NOT mean the marker is out of ink! The markers with dried out tips that I received were FULL of ink! They just needed the tip replaced. I find it easiest to remove a marker tip by wiggling it back and forth while also trying to pull it out at the same time).";Check each marker!

The tip is hard and small but ink flows evenly,so evenly in fact, that I noticed that there is no overlapping-lines-effectthat you get with cheap broad tips like the Crayola school markers. I have not left the cap off yet, so I don't know about drying, but the colors and the ultra fine tip make these a pleasure to color with.

48;5.0;5.0;174.0;-62.561320754716945;I really like these markers!  They write more evenly and smoothly than other metallic markers that I have tried in the past.  They work exactly like a black Sharpie, including the fact that the tip will probably mash down in time like a black Sharpie.  Nevertheless, if you are careful about how hard you press when writing, these should stay in good working condition for a good long time.\n\nI tested these markers on different colored surfaces.  Please bear in mind that throughout the test, I referred to the Bronze as being Copper.  I guess that's because it looks more like copper than bronze to me...\n\nThe Bronze and the Gold show up well against a variety of different background colors.  The Silver shows up best on black or very dark paper.  Please see product images for the results of the tests.\n\nThese markers will be perfect for labeling or decorating Christmas or birthday gifts!;Very Cool
3;6.0;2.0;22.0;-282.4860880829015;"I've used Sharpie ultra fine point, in all colors for many years, with red & blue being my favorite colors.  My stock of red was getting low, so it was time to replenish my stock.\n\nThe pros:\n+ These were an Amazon add-on item, with free shipping when I bought 3 boxes.\n+ Lots of colors & tip sizes to choose from.\n+ The ink is alcohol based, which makes the removal very easy on nonporous surfaces.\n+ Advertised -  Bright, colorful red ink makes a vivid impression.\n+ Advertised -  Ultra-fine tip lays down razor sharp lines.\n+ Advertised -  Ink dries quickly, resists smearing and fading and is water resistant.\n+ Advertised -  12 Red Sharpie permanent markers per box.\n\nThe cons:\n- The design has changed since I last purchased these.  The tip length is noticeably shorter... feels odd after using the older version with the longer tip extension.\n- All colors, with the exception of black will fade, when exposed to UV light.\n- The ink doesn't flow right away, which I find annoying!  I didn't have to ""prime"" the ink by drawing circles with the previous version of this pen.  This appears to happen with some of the pens, but not all of them!?\n\nClosing remarks:\n The black & green color, especially the green is problematic, with the ink flow being much less smooth, compared to the red & blue color.\n These are like ultra fine permanent marks, so they will bleed thru thin paper.\n On the attached pictures, I compare the old & new tip design.\n\n Update - April 18, 2017\n It's getting VERY annoying to pickup a pen & have to draw circles to prime the ink... to get the ink to flow.  See my attached picture.  I don't have this issue with the old Sharpie red ultra fine point pens?\n I also decided to drop my product rating to one star. :(\n\n Update - May 19, 2017\n I may have been too hasty on saying ""all"" the pens have to be ""primed"" before the ink flows.  To my surprise, some pens do work... the ink flows properly.  Perhaps there are defective pens in the first box I sourced pens from?\n I decided to up my product rating from one star to two.";My favorite writing instrument, unfortunately they have been redesigned! :(
66;7.0;5.0;122.0;-219.81649517684883;Sharpie makes a load of different color Sharpie markers, but none that comes out well against black, or similar dark background.\n\nIf you own brick power supplies, cables, DVD or BD players, many come in basic black.  How do you label or mark these items, other than using white tape to write on with a black Sharpie?\n\nPreviously, the way to write on black was with a white paint or similar color oil based paint pen, made by Sharpie and others.  These pens cost 3-4x more, dry out faster, need to be started before it writes, writes unevenly, but certainly was better than nothing.\n\nSharpie has succeeded in making a type of ink that provides a white like color, in this case silver.  They did it by creating an ultra fine silverish powder dissolved in the same solvent used for their color markers.  The result is a pen with ink that has all the same qualities as its standard markers, near the same cost, and the effectiveness of white paint on black backgrounds.  But even more, the paint is more 'reflective' in low light conditions, creating a low cost reflector effect.\n\nThe metallic paint is as 'permanent' as the other markers, and eventually they do come off.  But the pen is so easy to use, and cheap, that its effortless to re-write a label as needed.\n\nWhat takes the ink off?  Washing in hot water, constant rubbing, underwater submersion for multiple hours, extensively sunlight exposure, to name a few.  But if the items are kept out of direct sunlight, and rarely touched, such as labels on items, it has remained on for years.  I know, I've used Sharpies for over 10 years, and its the best marker pen I've used.\n\nI buy black markers by the dozen. Its also really made in USA.;Perfect for dark surfaces
46;8.0;5.0;84.0;-126.4550218340611;We buy them by the box! Does anyone ever remember what we did without Sharpies? I would rather use a Sharpie than a pen. We use them in several pen tip sizes and we buy them by the box of 12. Each pen size has its own benefit but they all feature permanent ink for most surfaces. The fine tip is good for marking on boxes and writing on CDs and DVDs you make. The ink is permanent, fast drying and water resistant but you can take it off some surfaces with rubbing alcohol. (Especially right after you write on something with it like a CD.)\n\nWe write the purchase date on stored food items or medicine bottles and boxes to always use the oldest first. We also mark the spare packages of batteries with the expiration date to use the older ones first. There are limitless uses for these permanent marking pens. We have used other types of pens but the Sharpies have the best pen tips and last the longest. Just keep the cap on after you are done. We love these pens and they are in every drawer of the house.\n\nI have attached a photo of the three pen tip sizes we use and a line drawn with each one to help you decide which size to buy, we purchased all of them.;My favorite writing tool, what did we do without them?
12;9.0;1.0;34.0;41.59500000000001;I was excited to receive my pens. We used them for the first time for about 45 minutes. When I collected them, over half of them were leaking ink all over the pens and their hands. I usually don't have a problem with Sharpir brand products, but this was really disappointing. I will probably need to throw them out!;Poor quality
1;10.0;4.0;6.0;-63.8171597633136;These are great for my tangled/mosaic drawings. My only complaint is that they don't sell all the colors individually. The Almond color is my favorite of all the ultra-fine markers I have (sharpie and bic) and I had to buy a whole new 24 pack just to get that one color. I use it so much it dried up. So eventually, I will be overrun with the colors I don't use as much.\n\nAnyway, I am now legally blind due to a disease that hit me in my late 20's. I have partial vision (legal blindness)in one eye and only light and dark in the other eye. So I do all my drawings through a high powered (and tiny) magnifying glass. These pens give me really good control with their pinpoint tips. The ink could be a little smoother--I like the flow of the bic markers better--but they have a slightly wider tip too.\n\nAll in all--even for serious artists--these are contenders.;Great even for a blind artist--vivid colors and pinpoint accuracy

Under Product Features is says: Extra precise, 0.2mm narrowed tip for extreme control and accuracy. I was expecting 0.2mm, similar to my Sakura Micron pens. This product is not 0.2mm.

45;14.0;4.0;45.0;-126.19674208144792;My now-wife/then-fianc bought this to use for addressing invitations that we sent out.  Considering the ungodly cost of the invitations, the fact that I got two of these for like four bucks is great.\n\nI want to write an acceptable review, although a person is limitied in what they can say regarding sharpies so here goes:  these sharpies are the bomb.  They're awesome.  Why are they awesome, you say?  Well first of all, they're cheap!  And they shipped fast!  And they came in unharmed!  But I'd also like to add that they're metallic, and the fine point on them is great for writing.  They're gold in color, too!  I may or may not have possibly written notes to myself in them, feeling very Midas-like as I did so.  The fine point pen makes them excellent for writing in big fonts or smaller handwriting.  There was no smudging shortly after writing as you may find with other sharpie-like products.  The Sharpie brand quality is definitely noticeable in the craftmanship.\n\nIf you need a sharpie, and it has to be fine point, and needs to be gold--or if perhaps you just like to write yourself lil' notes of encouragement while feeling like Midas--then this is the product for you!  And they're excellently priced, too!;First!

68;21.0;5.0;47.0;-235.966253776435;When I first discovered the Sharpie Permanent Fine-Point Markers I became an instant fan.  I am still a huge fan of these markers for labeling freezer and storage bags and cardboard boxes.  However, some 3M Post-It Flags, which I use a lot, are just too small for the fine point markers.  For that I use the Ultra-Fine Point Markers.\n\nJust like the fine point markers, these markers seem to last a long time if you take care to cap them as soon as you are finished with them. You also need to be careful not to get the tips wet or to damage the tip, but as long as you do not drop the pen on its tip it is reasonably durable.  I have seen a few people crush the tips of these markers (including a couple that were borrowed from me - sigh) by pushing on them too hard, but generally these are people who should be using a ball-point pen anyway.\n\nWe have tried a lot of different pens and markers for writing on plastic, and have had limited success. Many pens seem to take forever to dry or will not mark on plastic. Magic Markers work, but they are too wide and have an unlovely smell. So far Sharpie permanent fine-point and ultra fine-point markers avoid these problems, and provide sharp print for nearly all labeling needs. In fact, I will warn you that you should take care what you write on, because once you have used the Sharpie, it can be nearly impossible to get the ink out.\n\nI will also concur with another reviewer who pointed out that the ultra fine-point Sharpie can be an artist's instrument.  While my sketches are not what I would call art, the very fine point permits a lot of detail, and even shading effects.  To provide more ability, try using the Sharpie Fine-Point and the Sharpie Ultra Fine-Point.  These two pens give you quite a drawing arsenal.;Can do things the Sharpie Fine-Point Can Not

I haven't really used the other two (silver and bronze) markers yet, so I can't say much about how they work (or will die), but I was using the gold one to color leather on a pair of Nike sneakers. I was coloring over the neon yellow/green swoosh mark and I finished one shoe and was about to continue with the left pair the next day when the color wouldn't come out at all. I tried going over the previous days' coloring, but like another review said, it basically erased the color off the surface. It just came out very watery and unlike the original consistency. I had high hopes of DIY-ing the ugly neon swoosh, but now I'm left with one pretty, one ugly pair of shoes.\n\nUpdate: Right after writing this review, I stared at the pen for some time and realized a phrase that I haven't seen before: Store tip down.... fail on my part since I had left the pens upright with the tips pointing up.

I can also use the gold and bronze to touch up furniture, lamps, belt buckles, etc.  The trick is to wipe the metallic ink off the non-chipped/scraped area before it fully dries so that the Sharpie ink just covers the damaged portion.  Sure, it may sound ghetto, but for a couple bucks, it can extend the life of many things or just make them look better.;Love these metallic markers
11;34.0;3.0;7.0;-58.79577922077917;I purchased these pens with great excitement only to be disappointed. I had high hopes for them because I trusted the Sharpie brand but they fell short of expectations. While there is a nice variation and assortment of colors, the quality of writing is lacking. The most notable thing when using these pens is that half of them felt dried out when using them for the first time straight out of the package. They do not write smoothly by any means. Second is that about a third of the pens skip when writing so my words don't get a consistent line of ink (zoom in on picture for example). Lastly I felt that different pens wrote in different thicknesses, like the point of each pen wasn't the same resulting in some of my words written thinly and others rather thickly. These pens definitely won't be making it onto my favorites list.;I purchased these pens with great excitement only to be disappointed

Why white, well because like you, I've had many black items which I needed to write information on. And I'm too lazy to use a label maker.  Besides, there are certain things that labels will lose their adhesion on.  Example: Certain components in the engine compartment of your vehicle. Another example would be tires. The list is endless.\n\nI've read info. online that indicates that due to the pigment properties of the color white the manufacturers cannot make a white marker which would be useable.\n\nAbout 10 yrs. ago I called Sharpie's cust. service folks and asked why they don't make a white marker and the agent said, ""You know what? That's a very good question. I'll look into this and get back to you. Never heard a thing from them.\n\nAnyway this silver metallic marker is the next best thing to white.

They write with a crisp dark yet somewhat finer line; I would not call them a ""fine point"", as they write more like a ""medium point"", but they do that very, very well. The tip looks like it is quite durable.\n\nIt comes in three colors: silver, gold, and bronze. The silver is strong and shiny, not a simple gray. The gold and the bronze are similar in color but different--the bronze has more reddish tones and the gold is a true gold. They also have very little bleed-through; I even tested them on my Moleskine and with a light touch your can't barely see them from the other side of the page, just like regular fountain pen ink.\n\nI would not advise using these for simple writing, like in a journal or to write a letter, but for everything else--from labeling to craft projects to signatures to decorating--these markers will be great and are a good value.\n\nHighly recommended.\n*****";Great-Performing, Easy-To-Use Metallic Markers

The only thing better than an ultra fine point, black Sharpie is a box of 12 ultra fine point, black Sharpies - especially at this price! The permanent ink, combined with the awesomely ultra fine tip is what people adore about these marker pens. Very simple, but very powerful. These are kind of like the little black dress of mark making. The ink is fadeproof, the barrel is comfortable to hold, the marker/pen seems to be filled with a never-ending supply of deep black ink, and the tips spring back time after time. I can use one Sharpie for weeks without ever worrying about the tip flattening out. Sharpies can write on an incredible variety of surfaces - even writing on fabric, the writing is clear and readable (assuming it was legibly written ha).

13;47.0;4.0;6.0;-251.62487179487175;I love the Sharpies! The super fine too makes it easy to get into the tiny detailed spots in adult coloring pages. The ink is full and has not run out yet and I have used them coloring about 60 adult coloring post cards. This pack comes with a variety of colors to choose from and the price was marked great. At Michaels these same pens were $31.99 and even with a 40% off coupon, the Amazon price was better. At Staples the price was $22.99 and no coupon available. At Target they were higher prices than Michaels. So when my husband showed me the Amazin price it was a no brainier especially with the Prime 2 day shipping option. I was coloring within 48 hours.\nI took one star away for 3 reasons. The purple cap looks like a lavender, but it's a dark purple. The darker green is a deep, deep, dark green color which also doesn't match the cap. So test those out on paper before using so that you are not disappointed if the color doesn't work on your project. The other reason I took a star off is because the colors bleed through card stock, thick paper. I expect them to bleed through copy paper, but not good quality thick paper. So that was a little disappointing. I have another cheaper version of markers from Michaels that has less color options to choose from that are double sided with a fine tip in one side and a thicker brush style tip in the their side and they do not bleed through. So that is my biggest concern.\nThings I like about he markers is the variety of colors. The ease of putting the cap on and off. The price. The fine tip makes detailed work much easier. They are perfect for lettering art and freestyle design too.\nI hope that helps you in making your decision. They really are nice markers. I will buy another set when these dry up, but it doesn't appear that will be happening anytime soon.;Markers that make adult coloring pages shine with perfection.

What is nice about Sharpie is their consistency for color, with the exception of these special 24 packs they put out every once in a while.  This particular order was the 80s Glam Color.  When they do these specialty series (for lack of a better name), they basically give you nineteen of the traditional color of pens and trade out five of their normal colors for five brand new color introductions.  With the 80s Glam Color series the specialty colors are as follows:\n\n-  Power Pink,\n-  Racy Red,\n-  Super Sonic Yellow,\n-  Jet Set Jade, and\n-  Brilliant Dove.\n\nSince I started with Sharpies, I have just stuck with them over the years.  There are still a few issues I have with the Sharpie Brand.  I wish they would code their pens with either a color name or number.  Because as you change from one pen type it another (i.e., fine point to ultra-fine point), a few of the colors are so close, you cannot go by the color of the cap to match colors.  Since there is no name or number, you end up going to a scrap piece of paper to ensure you are picking the equivalent matching color.  This taking your eyes off of the art piece you are working on.  I also wish there was one more level of pens smaller than the ultra-fine point.  The ultra-fine point still leaves a lot of ink on the paper.  If your pen rests for even a moment in time, the ultra-fine point pen will puddle.  They are really only good for drawing, -- as they simply bleed through standard college rule paper.;The brand I rely on. These are markers and good for drawing / artwork.

They do bleed through to the back of the page, too, but I keep something under the page to absorb the excess.  They have lasted well, too.

1;1.0;5.0;5.0;24.961917808219198;Two years and counting! I teach first grade and go thru tons of pencils everyday. This sharpener has lasted for years and still sharpens perfectly. I bought two sharpeners for my classroom. I use one for regular pencils and the second is for colored pencils. For under 15$ this sharpner is a steal. I literally have two extras that I haven't used, but it might be a while before I need them.;Excellent sharpner for classroom use!
34;2.0;1.0;176.0;-165.97515267175567;"This ""sharpener"" won't sharpen.  When you try to use it, the pencil tip comes out slightly lopsided, with the lead covered with wood on one side all the way to the tip -- wood beyond the farthest reach of the lead.  Result: the wood-tipped pencil won't write, won't even deposit a mark on the paper.  And it isn't the pencil's fault. I tested three different lead pencils and four colored pencils.  I even gave each pencil a second sharpening, a second chance.  Same result each time: tip covered with wood.\n\nThe cause of the problem seems to be that this sharpener has only one roller-cutter.  Manual sharpeners have two roller sharpeners and work perfectly (but have to be screwed in place -- no desktop use, block venetian blinds on window sills -- and can't be placed in certain locations where the hand crank becomes inaccessible).  The X-Acto 1818, with its single cutter, doesn't seem to hold the pencil at the correct angle.  The pencil isn't gripped between two cutters.  That seems to account for the lopsided cutting.\n\nI suspect that this model requires precision assembly, so that the cutter is installed at the perfect angle.  Since other reviews suggest that this model sometimes works, my conclusion is that buying this model is a gamble.  In my case it was a complete waste of money: the ""sharpener"" simply didn't work.  So if you buy one, you are gambling.  You may get a properly assembled one that works, and you may get one that doesn't.";Complete failure
5;3.0;4.0;81.0;-121.41170506912437;"I have three kids and two are of school age. I bought this electric sharpener because I was getting tired of sharpening their pencils by hand. With the hand-sharpener the pencil leads are easily broken because of uneven torque around the pencil center. This sharpener works well, and because it applies equal force around the pencil, the leads rarely get broken (even those ""Halloween"" pencils from Five&Below!).\n\nAfter 18 months of use the sharpener stopped working. It would make a humming noise (indicating the motor still works) but would not sharpen the pencil. I opened it up and found that the motor gear no longer was in contact with the sharpener part.  After a couple of minutes of googling I found the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvblgS38DkQ  Then I followed the video and fixed the motor with two washers.  What happens is that there is a plastic piece that is supposed to make the motor and the sharpener in contact, and this plastic piece is glued to the motor. (I could see the green-color glue). Over time the glue got weakened from heat and the piece got dislodged.\n\nAnyway, it is working as solid as new now.  Very happy! (But subtracting one star due to the improper use of glue.)";Solid sharpener, works well, but gave my engineering self a good test today.

36;5.0;2.0;126.0;5.021315789473718;Before purchasing the X-Acto Electric Pencil Sharpener, I paid half the price for an electric sharpener from Wal-Mart that lasted over five years.  This product has lasted a mere five months.  Rarely used, it often sticks, overheats after only a few uses, and then ceases to work at all.\n\nI had hoped a sharpener of better quality would last longer, especially considering it isn't even used very often.  It would seem I was mistaken.;Disappointing!
8;6.0;1.0;64.0;36.26086956521742;Wow. I purchased this pencil sharpener in late-November, unwrapped it, and put it in my studio. I've been busy with other things, so it wasn't until last Monday that I tried it. It doesn't work. AT ALL. I plugged it in several sockets, and it does nothing. And now it's too late to get a refund. If you purchase this product, try it right away!;This pencil sharpener didn't work. Period!
11;7.0;1.0;71.0;34.26100000000003;I ordered one , anticipated it's arrival once I opened it it barely made a move , thinking it was defective sent it back and reworded it, when I finally received the next one it didn't work either ... I was extremely disappointed and WILL not order again from this company ...;Disappointed
27;8.0;4.0;63.0;-45.421956521739105;I had a Boston electric sharpener that worked superbly for years, ever since med school.  It finally sharpened it's last pencil about a month ago, so had to order another Boston.  Even tho it says it is a Boston, the front label is X-Acto, likely bought out by Boston. In any event, the sharpener is superb, sharpening to a symmetric, sharp point, with no rough edges.  HOWEVER.....it DOES NOT have a pencil saver as described, it will sharpen a brand new pencil to the point where it cannot be fed into the machine anymore if you let it.  So, if you are looking for an auto shut off, do not buy this one.  I am extremely pleased with the purchase otherwise.  It was delivered in great shape, and exactly on the date it was supposed to.;No auto stop, otherwise, excellent
29;9.0;5.0;63.0;-50.713461538461516;"Coming from a family of educators, we tend to be very picky about our pencil sharpeners. We like them solid and efficient; quickly driving the #2 down to a fine and sharp point without wasting much of the pencil length. Poorly designed sharpeners are horrible, and often require you to constantly grind the pencil down before achieving an adequate point. You will not have that problem with this pencil sharpener. The X-Acto Electric Pencil Sharpener is well built, durable, and finely-tuned to meet your lead sharpening requirements. The pencil is quickly sharpened to a fine, exact point, without being wasted. Disposal of the grind is easy with the removable trap. We've owned many of these sharpeners over the years, and this one is the best so far. Highly recommended!";Solid and Sharp
18;10.0;5.0;52.0;-141.33601659751037;"Oh, the madness we used to live in before I bought an X-Acto Electric Pencil Sharpener.\n\nIn those days, our four kids would sharpen new pencils using those handheld manual sharpeners that student stores sell for 89 cents, and would then relegate the pencils to a drawer once their graphite tips broke off.  Over the years, this has led to quite an impressive collection of broken-tipped pencils.\n\n""Oh, you need help with your math homework?  Let me just get a pencil.  Got one...nope.  Got one...nope.  Got one...nope.  Got one...nope.""\n\nI finally grew frustrated enough to just order an electric sharpener.  I chose the X-Acto model, based on price and reviews.  We have not been disappointed.  Now, this is not a top-of-the-line model because it does feel a bit flimsy, and when you insert a pencil too firmly into the sharpener the motor does slow down in protest, but it gets the job done every time.\n\nIt gets. The job. Done.\n\nAnd now I have a drawer filled with sharp-tipped pencils, ready for eager young minds to use.  Well, not the minds, per se, but fingers controlled by the mind.  You know what I mean.  And when those pencil points grow dull, my children know that our trusty X-Acto Electric Pencil Sharpener is there.  That's right:  TRUSTY.\n\nThe madness is gone.  A calm serenity has enveloped our household.  Thanks, X-Acto!";Life is better now that I have my pencil sharpener
0;11.0;5.0;64.0;14.78988764044945;I have an old one of these from 1993. After all of these years, it still works perfectly. This sharpener has been through some heavy work (I used to sharpen pencils for my church) but always has managed to keep in top shape. I've bought these as gifts for people because it's always something you can use and is something that will last a good while. Noise-wise it's not too bad, maybe not something you'd want in your classroom during a test, but otherwise okay.;The Best
39;12.0;1.0;59.0;-12.769736842105246;I ordered the Hunt(R) Boston(R) 1800 Series Electric Pencil Sharpener, from Amazon.com and they in turn sent the order to Office Depot which sells those X-Acto By Boston 1800 Series Electric Sharpener, Black Sharpeners made in China that will not sharpen a pencil to save your life, the same ones they sell at Staples, which is why I tried to buy the Hunt(R) Boston(R) 1800 Series Electric Sharpener online. Now I have to send it back and try to get the good Boston pencil sharpener with the strong electric motor in it that will sharpen a pencil, stuff made in china is crap, boycott all products made in china.;Watch out for product switching
2;13.0;5.0;8.0;-79.89114457831322;I tried 3 different manual razor blade type pencil sharpeners and they would break the lead regularly on my colored pencils. At first I thought it was due to the brand of colored pencil so I purchased 2 more different brands and the same problem. That prompted me to start researching and determined that it was the pencil sharpener as colored pencils are softer than a regular pencil. After much research I choose this pencil sharpener based on the many reviews that I sharpens colored pencils perfectly and without breaking the lead during sharpening. I have now sharpened about 60 colored pencils with no broken lead.\nYou do not have to worry about over sharpening as the sharpening will stop once the pencil is perfectly sharp. You may think that it is still sharpening as the motor does not stop operating once the pencil is sharp but it has a mechanical stop that stops the sharpening. You can feel the difference once the pencil is sharp.;I highly recommend for Colored Pencil sharping.
6;14.0;3.0;22.0;-255.81605263157888;"This X-Acto electric pencil sharpener was a good purchase.  It was purchased to replace another X-Acto (Model 1800) pencil sharpener that lasted about three years.  We are using it in our home but it sees pretty frequent use due to our having three elementary aged children.  After about six months this pencil sharpener is holding up well.  It sharpens well, it does not make too much noise and it has a pretty strong motor.  For the price this was a great buy and, after having some duds, the X-Actos have performed better for us than the other electric pencil sharpeners we have tried in this price range.  Our experience has been about a three year lifespan, with the motor being the thing that goes first.\nSome minor nitpicks:  The motor will periodically stop mid-job if you are sharpening a few pencils at a time; presumably to keep the motor from overheating or becoming too taxed (after a short respite it starts up again)  but that can be kind of annoying.  Also, the plastic on this units construction is thinner than the prior model we had bought just a few years ago.  Lastly and most annoyingly, emptying the tub of shavings is somewhat messy due to the vertical tub design.\nOverall, this unit was a decent purchase for us and should be for anyone needing assistance with light to moderate pencil sharpening duties.\nHaving owned the X-Acto 1800 prior, I would go for that one if I were buying again as it felt and operated a bit more substantially and emptied cleanly.  The 1800 is a few dollars more, but it is worth it in build/operational quality.\nGood luck.  With the first day of school approaching we will surely test this sharpener's fortitude; assume it continues to perform admirably if there is no update.\n\nUPDATE 11/13/15:  While the sharpener works very well and can handle a lot of usage, emptying it is a royal pain that will undoubtedly require you clean up around it after removing the shavings.";Review after six months of use: Reliable & economical.  However, for a few bucks more, spring for the X-Acto 1800.
38;15.0;1.0;48.0;27.955454545454565;Agree with the previous reviewer.  Office Depot is currently selling the made-in-china X-acto brand sharpener.  Bought one and returned it after three pencils.  Didn't seem to have much power, stalled the motor on the first pencil.  Created nice sharp points though, just not always centered on the pencil.  I'm looking for another sharpener.;Returned it
21;16.0;4.0;27.0;-234.0714285714285;"I have 2 children in school. Homework is done with pencils and it's done every day. It seems that we never have a sharp pencil when we need it. I keep all of the pencils in one place, but I pull out pencil after pencil after pencil and never seem to have a sharpened one when I need it. We have several small plastic pencil sharpeners but they always seem to be lost. Honestly, sharpening pencils by hand every day is tedious and annoying. I decided I wanted an electric pencil sharpener, so I turned to Amazon. I was shocked by how pricey that are! After reading many reviews on this one, I decided to make the purchase. I ordered another item from Amazon last week. It still hasn't arrived but this one came in about 2 days! Shockingly fast shipment! I plugged it in and started sharpening pencils. It is very fast and the pencils have a nice sharp tip. I did notice that it tends to leave a bit too much of the wood on one corner fairly consistently, but I just fixed this by rotating the pencil one time while sharpening. I sharpened nearly 30 pencils and it took me less than 10 minutes at the MOST. AND, several of the pencils were brand new and being sharpened for the first time. I am VERY pleased. I filled the shaving container and emptied the contents with no difficulty at all. I am very impressed by this little machine and the price is MUCH lower than any of the others with good reviews. I like that it has a plug because I don't want to have to replace batteries. That is about as tedious as sharpening pencils by hand, so I love the plug ; ) I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with school age children. It is not just for business customers. It's for anyone that uses a good, old-fashioned wooden pencil!";Very Pleased. Great Quality, great price
37;17.0;5.0;26.0;-12.109702970296993;This pencil sharpener (Hunt(R) Boston(R) 1800 Series Electric Sharpener) is indeed a good deal. I read about some negative feedbacks online saying that it is not powerful enough, so I hesitated a little bit before I bought it. However, it turned out that this pencil sharpener is really powerful, and sharps my pencil really well. It is even more powerful than my suitemate's pencil sharpener bought from Staples with a higher price.\nI don't know what can be a better pro for a pencil sharpener than its being powerful-- this is a great price, and great product.;A power house!

I am old fashioned and prefer wooden pencils to mechanical.  I do however like my pencils sharp and ready for use.  This pencil sharpener does the trick.\n\nIt does not have an auto stop. I do have to firmly press the pencil in to the hole and it does seem a bit noisy but overall it is a solid sharpener.  The tips come out uniform.\n\nI would recommend this unit for anyone looking for an electric sharpener.;Quick and Efficient
3;19.0;3.0;6.0;14.063529411764733;Although I'm impressed with the look and the sturdiness of the X-ACTO XLR Electric Pencil Sharpener, I am unimpressed with how well it sharpens my pencils.  It seems to have a somewhat aggressive approach with the pencils and chews them up pretty quickly if you don't use a light touch when inserting them.  I also have to rotate the pencil while sharpening to give it a uniform tip when complete.  Even at that, it's not a great job.  However, it's satisfactory.;It's satisfactory
26;20.0;5.0;12.0;47.235000000000014;Last Boston sharpener like this one died after only 29 years, from a stripped large plastic gear inside.

If it lasts half as long, I'll be overjoyed!;drrod's new sharpener
9;21.0;5.0;8.0;11.796428571428592;Awesome pencil Sharpener! Always sharpens my pencils perfect. I bought this for my kids.

In talking with Shoplet's Customer Service department the Amazon link is attached to the X-Acto product in Shoplet's inventory.  X-Acto, as well as Hunt & Boston, are now Elmer's Products, Inc. brands.  I tried to research on the web whether the Hunt Boston 1800 is still made; it is unclear.  This maybe the only model currently available.\n\nShoplet issued me a full refund of the product and let me keep it.  We have are not heavy pencil users and have only sharpened 10+ pencils so far.

30;33.0;4.0;7.0;-622.8176437587657;"After reading the reviews posted on this product (A bunch of fine reviews too, I must say), there seems to be a very wide range of opinion concerning this electric pencil sharpener.  After reading both the good and bad reviews it would almost seem like we are all talking about two completely different products.  I am not sure why this is happening and can only speculate.  I suspect that it is a combination of things ranging from customer's different expectations all the way to some major quality control issues at the factory (Where ever that is) where the sharpeners are made.\n\nBe that as it may, I can only tell you my personal experiences with this particular product.  I had and have an earlier model of this sharpener here on my desk.  It has given me about eight years of very dependable services.  Of late though you can tell it is suffering from old age and is about to give up the ghost.  When these machines became available on Vine I jumped at the chance.\n\nThe price here is quite reasonable for what you are getting.  These are not industrial type sharpeners.  They are for light office use and I do not recommend them for use in places such as schools.  There are reasons for this.  First, they are noisy; unbelievable noisy as a matter of fact.  Having a bunch of kids destroying perfectly good pencils for seven or eight hours could quite well drive you to distraction...to say the least.  Secondly, these sharpeners are designed to do the work for you.  By that I mean you are suppose to gently but firmly place the pencil in the sharpener and let it work for you.  Kids do not like to do this.  They will invariably cram the pencil in as hard as their little hands will allow and see how much pencil they can eat up before you tell them to stop.  That is just the way kids are...always have been, always will be.  If you put too much force on the pencil you will find that the point comes out quite lop-sided with wood going all the way to the tip.\n\nNow that being said, when I first opened this sharpener I immediately sharpened 24 pencils that I had in my desk.  This sharpener is extremely fast and delivers a very, very sharp point.  The down side here is that the exposed wood on the tip is a bit rougher than I like.  I suppose the single blade versus the double grinders found on hand sharpeners makes the difference.  This is a minor problem though and is more a personal thing than anything else.\n\nI like the fact that this sharpener is electric rather than battery.  Sharpeners eat up batteries at about the same rate they eat up pencils.\n\nI liked the rather long cord; it was much longer than my old model had which had created some problems in the past.  I also like the sleek look of this thing.  I also like the fact that it is heavy enough that you do not have to bolt it down somewhere.  I liked the fact that this machine did not break ever other point as it sharpened.\n\nNow I do a lot of drawing and sharpen most of my drawing pencils by had using a knife.  This is particularly true of my colored pencils.  I am old, it was the way I was trained and I have no intention of changing.  It should be noted though that if you use this machine or any other electric pencil sharpener, that you may have a problem with some of the wax based leads in some of the colored pencils...they can cause clogging.  That is the nature of most sharpeners.\n\nThe reason I am giving this one four stars rather than five is due to the noise level and the fact that every so often you find that you get a lop-sided tip...this was probably my fault, but I feel the machine should have been engineered to cover up my stupidity and ineptness.\n\nNice sharpener for the money.  Hope it lasts as long as the last one.\n\nDon Blankenship\nThe Ozarks";HOPE THIS ONE LASTS AS LONG AS MY LAST ONE.  Good sharpener for the money
32;34.0;1.0;6.0;26.3246153846154;This pencil sharpener does not have a reliable auto-stop feature like most electric sharpeners.  The pencils come out bizarrely sharp and pointy, which causes the lead to break immediately.  It also does not sharpen evenly, so part of the wood is at the tip along with the lead.

14;36.0;4.0;5.0;-108.21681818181813;Received this sharpener today, works well, sharpens to a fine point.  It is not as shown on Amazon.  XACTO must have bought out Hunt Boston.  I will keep it, as not one of the reviews I read complained about the ability of this sharpener to do its job.  For the money, I can't complain.  Workmanship appears to be adequate, not spectacular.  I bought this to replace a Panasonic I have owned since 1962 (which is still running, however, the draw to remove the debris is slightly cracked).  The Panasonic had two hole entrances, one for large, the other for small pencils.  This sharpener only has one.  The drawer does not hold as much debris as my Panasonic, therefore the only downside I can foresee is having to empty it frequently.  The price is very reasonable as battery operated ones I have tried at the same price do not compare in any way, shape or form.  A safe purchase, even if the photo on Amazon is of an earlier model.  Has anyone notified Amazon of this discrepancy?

Like everyone else, the reason I chose this was due to its stellar rating and the brand that I received had slightly worse ratings, hence my decision to order the Hunt Boston Electric Pencil Sharpener. The product I received seemed to be poorly made and maybe even used, there was separation on one of casing seams. This screams poor form and finish, and shoddy workmanship. The product does however, seem to sharpen pencils as expected and I really don't feel like the hassle of returning it for now. Buyer beware - when you order this product, you will be sent an entirely different one in the classic bait and switch mode. I expected better from Amazon.";Bait and Switch
16;38.0;5.0;5.0;-9.29897196261679;Wow.  That's all I can say.  This sharpens even colored pencils to a dangerously sharp point.  Nice and even all around every time.  I've never had a sharpener that can do that.  You can hear when the sharpener changes sounds that your pencil is done.  Doesn't shut off automatically, you just need to listen for the queue that it is finished.  Much better than the pencil sharpeners we even have at our work.  The only thing that would be an improvement would be a choice for a wider pencil, but this fits the bill for your standard pencil, which is what we use anyway.;My pencils are so sharp now, may be a lethal weapon!  :o)
28;39.0;2.0;5.0;-677.618622047244;"I have used a Hunt Boston pencil sharpener for years.  The Hunt Boston sharpener is relatively quiet and efficient.  I think we have used it for at least five years or more.  I am also a huge fan of X-Acto knives.  I have a bunch of X-Acto knives along with dozens of blades.  X-Acto brand knives and blades are great for woodworking, building plastic models, and other hobbies.  Thus, I was excited to try a pencil sharpener from X-Acto.\n\nThe pencil sharpener looks like a high quality product.  It feels solid and sturdy and rests firmly and flatly on my workbench.  I was initially impressed and almost ready to sharpen pencils.  Before I did, I removed the tray that holds the wood shavings.  The tray seemed a little cheap, but hey, it is a plastic tray to hold trash, so how fancy does it need to be?  The problem came when I tried to put the tray back into the pencil sharpener.  The tray would not go back into its slot.\n\nSurely, I was doing something wrong.  I took the tray back out to make sure I had not missed some sort of adjustment that needed set to get the tray back into the sharpener.  After all, I am a typical guy and I only read the instructions after figuring out how something works, if ever.  However, I had not missed anything.  The problem is that a plastic prong on the back of the tray, which I think engages a safety switch that enables to sharpener to work only when the tray is in place, did not properly mate with the hole.  It takes some jiggling of the tray to get it in place each time I remove it.  The inability to easily mate with the pencil sharpener subtracts one and a half stars.\n\nAfter finally getting the tray back into the pencil sharpener, I was ready to sharpen a pencil or a bunch of them since I seem to accumulate dull pencils on my workbench, where I do not have a pencil sharpener.  Into the sharpener went a pencil.  The good news is that the sharpener did quickly put a nice point on the end of my pencil.  The bad news is that I thought the sharpener was broken.  The sharpener makes a horrible grinding noise every time I sharpen a pencil.  In contrast, my Hunt Boston sharpener makes a humming noise when the motor operates.  The X-Acto sharpener seems to be working well; it is just relatively noisy compared with my current Hunt Boston, and a former electric sharpener that the Hunt Boston replaced.  The noise is also obnoxious and sounds like something is operating in a way it should not be operating.  I subtract a second star and a half for excessive and unnecessary noise, which may be an indication of something that may break in the long term.\n\nI must to admit to some disappointment.  X-Acto is a brand I associate with high quality.  The shaving tray is hard to install and the motor sounds like grinding gears.  It is possible that my pencil sharpener is defective.  However, I would have thought that routine acceptance testing would catch a defective product prior to shipment.  That leads me to believe that X-Acto considers this product typical production.  If that is the case, I have to recommend against purchasing this product.\n\nI looked at the ratings on Amazon for this product and, unsurprisingly, learned that this product has many one and two star ratings.  The one and two star ratings tell a story.  Many of the ratings are because the sharpener failed to sharpen either well or at all.  Many of these ratings are because the sharpener failed immediately or within days, weeks or months of purchase.  What I wonder is whether someone thought it might be a good idea to involve Amazon Vine reviewers in the hope that Vine reviewers might be more favorable.  If that was the thought, the thought was in vain because I am only slightly more impressed than previous reviewers are.\n\nI hoped the X-Acto name was an indication of the quality of this product.  It is not.  I am disappointed with the shavings tray and with the noise level and the type of noise.  This product does not seem to me like it is going to be durable and without changes, I would not buy this product again.  Because I would not purchase this product for quality and performance reasons, it automatically receives two stars.\n\nGood Luck!";I am a little disappointed
33;40.0;4.0;5.0;48.890000000000015;I got this as I have 4 young kids (9,7,5,3) and have an huge number of color pencils to sharpen.  I got sick of the hand crank sharpener as it broke alot of leads and took forever.  I sharpened all the pencils when i got the sharpener, somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 pencils, and it never missed a beat.;Works great, easy for kids

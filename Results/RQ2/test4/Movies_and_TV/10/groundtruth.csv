2;1.0;4.0;56.0;-1440.578968935889;"During the early 1980's, Americans were treated with vehicles that sported the latest futuristic technology.  For cars, there was ""Knight Rider"".  For motorcycles, there was ""Street Hawk"".  And in 1983, people were captivated by a helicopter known as ""Blue Thunder"".\n\nThe film was directed by world renown director John Badham (""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""WarGames"") and feature a screenplay by Dan O'Banon (""Alien"" films and ""Total Recall"") and Don Jakoby (""Vampires"" and ""Death Wish 3'), music by Arthur B. Rubinstein (""Double Jeopardy"" and ""Face Value"") and cinematography by John A. Alonzo (""Star Trek: Generations"", ""The Meteor Man"" and ""Internal Affairs"").\n\n""BLUE THUNDER"" would star Roy Scheider (""SeaQuest DSV"", ""Jaws"" and ""The French Connection) as LAPD helicopter pilot Officer Frank Murphy.  Together with his new rookie partner Officer Richard Lymangood (Daniel Stern), while the two were patroling Los Angeles through the air, they happen to come across on what appeared to be a robbery attempt on city councilwoman Diane McNeely.\n\nUnfortunately, before they arrived near the city councilwoman's area, the two were using their helicopter to observe a woman working out nude in her home.  But also, due to previous situations, Officer Frank Murphy is due for a psychological evaluation.  In fact, Murphy tends to use his stop watch to make sure that his mind is thinking straight (despite having nightmares of a Vietnamese soldier being thrown off a helicopter that he was piloting).\n\nWhile meeting with his superior, Captain Jack Braddock (Warren Oates), the LAPD is calling the situation of the councilwoman as a theft and rape incident but Officer Murphy knows that there was no rape but his superior doesn't want to hear anything further from Murphy and relieves both him and Lymangood as pilots for the LAPD temporarily.\n\nBut the good news for Murphy and Lymangood is that they will be able to test out an advanced helicopter known as ""Blue Thunder"".  Using the latest in weapons armament and stealth technology, the ""Blue Thunder"" can listen to any conversation as far as 200 ft., armed with machine guns, able to video/audio record outside incidents and also to be tied into various government and law enforcement computers and much more.  The bad news is that the person that is heading the operation for ""Blue Thunder"" is US Army Colonel F.E. Cochrane (Malcolm McDowell) who is the primary test pilot of the new helicopter.  Both Murphy and Cochrane end up crossing paths and because of their past history, Murphy despises him for a reason unknown.\n\nWhile on the first night testing the ""Blue Thunder"" in Los Angeles, both Murphy and Lymangood are just in awe of the capabilities of the helicopter.  But the two end up using the equipment to spy on Cochrane for the fun of it but what they hear is a shocker.  Because of this, Murphy and Lymangood become a target.  Can Murphy and Lymangood survive long enough to stop the people behind Project THOR?\n\nVIDEO & AUDIO:\n\nFor those who are big fans of ""BLUE THUNDER"", you will be happy to know that the film is given a magnificent transfer on Blu-ray.  The film is presented in 1080p High Definition (with an aspect ratio of 2:40:1) and having seen this film and having it on VHS and DVD, I can tell you that this is the definitive version to own.\n\nFor one thing, for a 1983 film, the film just looks great.  The film offers a stark contrast between the day and nighttime sequences and there is a broad spectrum of colors utilized throughout the film.  I didn't notice any significant artifacting, banding or source noise.  I was so happy to see this film not DNR'd (digital noise reduction) and the grain of the film included but not to the point where its too distracting.  There are far many 1980's films that are too soft or too grainy and this film is just right.\n\nAs for the audio, ""BLUE THUNDER"" is presented with an English and French Dolby TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack.  It's important to emphasize that this film is a 1983 film and can't be compared to today's modern action films.  But  yet, the soundtrack is utilized quite well.  The helicopters rotors spinning, to the echoes of the megaphone, the many explosions and the musical score just coming out quite clear (and loud).  Dialogue remains crisp and clear and overall, there is a good amount of action scenes that utilize the explosions and thus filling the soundstage with automobile and aircraft sounds and machine guns galore.  I was very impressed by the soundtrack for this 26-year-old film.\n\nAs for subtitles, the film is presented in English, English SDH and French.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES:\n\n""BLUE THUNDER"" comes with the following special features (featured in standard definition):\n\n  * Director, Editor and Motion Control Supervisor Commentary - The Blu-ray includes the 2006 DVD Special Edition commentary featuring Director John Badham, Editor Frank Moriss and motion-control supervisor Hoyt Yeatman.  For those who have never heard of a Badham commentary, Badham is very concise and definitely gives you a peak through his mind of directing and is quite thorough on explaining how this film was created.  It's important to note that these days, a lot of these scenes would be CGI'd but back then, the chase scenes between helicopters were done without CG.  So, it was a challenging and risky film to direct.\n  * ""The Special"": Building Blue Thunder: Making-of the Helicopter - (8:23) Director John Badham, Sydney Z. Litwack (Art Director) and staff from the film discuss the making of the Blue Thunder helicopter and how the concept was created.\n  * Ride With The Angels: Making Blue Thunder - Multi-part Featurette - (44:41) This making of featurette discuss the Director John Badham and his involvement with the film.  Badham and producers talk about the talent they worked with in the film and what they added to the film.  Also, how talented Warren Oates was in the film but passed away a month after the film stopped shooting.  Discussion about the storyboards, Roy Scheider talks about his excitement of riding in the aircraft and Malcolm McDowell's fear of flying.  Also, how a lot of the explosions and destructive scenes were created.\n  * 1983 Promotional Featurette - (8:34) The original 1983 featurette featuring clips from the film, behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with the talent of the film.\n  * BD-Live Enabled - For those with Blu-ray players that are Profile 2.0, this Blu-ray disc is BD-Live enabled.\n\nJUDGMENT CALL:\n\nWhen I was younger, I was totally enamored with this film and also the helicopter television shows (""Airwolf"" and ""Blue Thunder"") at the time.  Typically, we never really saw a helicopters as a mean, fighting machine.  But ""BLUE THUNDER"" really gave us a glimpse of modern technology at that time.\n\nIt has been 26 years since this film came out in the theaters and watching it again, its easy to be shocked of how much of this film featured actual helicopters flying through Los Angeles and of course, how the destruction of parts in Los Angeles was shown through this film.  Surprising because now in Post 9/11, these type of films will never be created in this manner and nor would we see aircraft going at it like this and if it did, it would be CGI.\n\nBut it's just remarkable to know how much went into the filming of ""Blue Thunder"" without the use of today's modern technology.  How the talents (Scheider and McDowell) actually were in the helicopters being filmed during the air battles and also, the overall destruction of parts of Los Angeles.  There is no way we are ever going to see this type of destruction in this manner in a film, especially how it was created.\n\nFor the most part, the film shows its age through the various vehicles and clothing styles of the early 80's but the Blu-ray transfer really brings out the detail of the film.  One of the problems of the Special Edition DVD is that the film looked soft and muddy but for the Blu-ray release, I was impressed by its High Definition transfer.  Also, combined with the lossless audio and the fact that audio is a big part of this action film, it made the film much more enjoyable.  And where many 1980's film are devoid of special features for their DVD or Blu-ray release, the good news is that this special edition of ""BLUE THUNDER"" does come with a few hours of special features.\n\nOverall, ""BLUE THUNDER"" is an awesome release on Blu-ray.  The release is quite solid with its impressive on HD and its easy to recommend this film but also, I'm quite confident to say that this is the definitive version of ""BLUE THUNDER"" to own at this current time.\n\nFor fans of this film, this Blu-ray release is definitely recommended!";"Blu-ray:  Fans of ""Blue Thunder"" will appreciate how difficult it was to have this kind of film to be made back then..."
4;2.0;3.0;43.0;-98.3895454545454;This Special Edition turned out to be not so special after all. Okay, the new transfer is better looking than the previous release. But the movie itself remains the same old version, missing a good bit of the car chase which, for some reason, was included in European copies but was never shown in the US.\n\nThe missing part - check it out on imdb - takes place when Roy Scheider's wife, rushing to the TV studio with the tape, drives into a back alley with patrol cars on her tail: there, she skids into a wall on two wheels, bangs the roof of her car, then resumes her crazy run as the patrol cars slam into each other - and this is what makes Scheider wince from his chopper above.\n\nApart from leaving aside a nice piece of stunt work, this cut also accounts for a continuity loophole, when we see the car drive into the TV studio parking lot with a badly battered rooftop.\n\nGranted, this missing part is no big deal, but it certainly makes this so-called 'Special Edition' a bit of a disappointment.\n\nFive stars for the movie, three for the DVD.;Still not the complete cut...
8;3.0;4.0;15.0;-160.2920331950207;As a boy growing up in the 80's, this was just about as cool as it got this side of Star Wars.  Although my tastes have become somewhat more sophisticated over the years, I still enjoy a well-crafted action movie, and this certainly qualifies.  Although the movie at times becomes campy due to overacting or poorly choreographed action sequences (hey, Badham didn't have $150M to work with, OK?) the movie's themes regarding the dangers of advanced technology as a tool of repression and protection of the homeland against terrorists still ring true.  And besides, the helicopter is still really cool, even if the cockpit is reminiscent of Knight Rider's KITT (another 80's must).\nTechnically, the film is quite good overall.  Especially in the chase scenes, one gets the feeling that Badham and his crew spent hundreds of hours in the air to get the quality and quantity of footage necessary to pull this movie off.  The editing, however, leaves something to be desired at times, particularly the ADR, which on numerous occasions does not appear to match the actors' mouth movements.  Otherwise, however, the film is masterful, especially considering the technology used to edit it at the time.\nIf you are looking for high art, look elsewhere.  If you are looking for Matrix-like special effects, look elsewhere.  If you are looking for an entertaining action movie from the Reagan era, you're in the right place.;Still Cool After All These Years

There is no anamorphic transfer (for widescreen tv's) included on this dvd even though other reviewers here have stated that one does exist.  The widescreen review even stated ""incorrectly"" that the anamorphic transfer looked good.\nIf you want to purchase this for your widescreen tv, seek out alternate versions (british region 2) that include the actual widescreen (anamorphic) print.";This is not an anamorphic widescreen release
3;5.0;5.0;7.0;-115.51086294416241;"If you're a ""Blue Thunder"" fan then this DVD is the only version for you. This special edition version is presented in its 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen aspect ratio and remastered in high definition. The picture transfer and Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound are truly outstanding. The 5.1 surround sound breathes new life into this 1983 action classic and you get to hear ""Blue Thunder"" really roar.\n\nFor those who don't know it, ""Blue Thunder"" is a new helicopter prototype that is secretly being tested by the government on its unsuspecting citizens. The helicopter is superior to anything ever built and it comes heavily armored. In the wrong hands ""Blue Thunder"" would be unstoppable. The movie stars Roy Scheider as Frank Murphy, the Blue Thunder pilot, Daniel Stern as his partner Lymangood and Malcolm McDowell as the bad guy Colonel Cochrane and he's perfect in his role. The DVD contains bonus features such as commentary, theatrical trailer, storyboard galleries and making of featurettes. After comparing both DVD versions, in my opinion this one was the best.

1;7.0;5.0;7.0;-257.3660869565217;"Blue Thunder is the fictional story of a high tech helicopter which the government plans to use against the population under the guise of ""crowd control from the air"" for the upcoming Olympic games.  Some of you may remember Airwolf, or even the short lived Blue Thunder series with James Farentino and Dana Carvey, this is where it all started.\nAlthough the plot is kinda lame, this movie boasts state of the art (in 1983) aerial combat action sequences over Los Angeles (L.A. natives will recognize the Piper Tech building, where air support is headqurtered, the downtown cityscape, the L.A. river), and a cool chase scene through the LA River, which like the rest of L.A., is concrete and steel.  Roy Scheider (Murphy), Daniel Stern(Lymangood), and Warren Oates (in his last picture), give great performances, however, Malcom MacDowell's character, a sinister Army Lt. Colonel, is a bit hard to believe.  The real star of the show here is Blue Thunder, a modified 1972 French Gazelle, outfitted with listening devices, video and infrared cams, and an M61 20mm vulcan cannon fitted to the nose. Blue Thunder is able to see through walls, peek down dresses at 1000 feet, and destroy a city block at the touch of a button. Some will notice the similarities to the Apache AH-64, and the cockpit windows are faceted, much like the then-classified stealth fighter.\nBlue Thunder takes us to that ""big brother is watching you"" card reminicent of 1984,(which is the year the Olympics were in L.A.) what with its surveillance equipment, and there is even a reference to that in the movie, when Lymangood asks Murphy, ""Big Brother, you want it on or off?"" referring to the cockpit recorder which records their conversations. ""I think we can lose that,""he replies.\nThe ending battle scene is great, with an awesome finale, and a somewhat chilling epilogue, as the credits begin to roll.  You get the feeling that Murphy has avenged.\nAll in all, a pretty good movie with a bit of techno-sci-fi-thriller.";My favorite movie of all time

Only Roy Sheider can save the day by hanging off a flagpole on the side of a building and firing a rifle at Blue Thunder's gas tank, causing the shark to explode and then Sheriff Brody has to swim back to shore with a guy who has been ""counting money all [his] life"".  Something like that.  Blue Thunder had slightly less appeal than the hit tv series ""Airwolf"" (starring critically acclaimed alcoholic wife-beater, Jan Michael Vincent).  As the film moves toward the end, you will look back and realize that the woman getting naked in the first 15 minutes of the movie was the best part ... and you will want to rewind it and watch that part again.  If Popeye, Iron Eagle, and Red Dawn are in your movie collection, you may as well round it off and purchase Blue Thunder as well.";Blue Thunder Bowl ...
0;9.0;4.0;5.0;-298.81608108108105;"""Blue Thunder"" is an experimental helicopter designed to be prevent or otherwise deal with any terrorist situation.  With its armor plating and rotary cannon, Blue Thunder (a converted Gazelle Helicopter) is no mere observer helicopter.  Also equipped with an array of sensors and a computer that can hack into anyting, and an engine silencer and its pilot can sneak the chopper's awesome firepower right up to the enemy before being spotted.\nRoy Scheider is Murphy, a police pilot and shell-shocked Viet Nam vet, is given the task of field-testing the new chopper in hopes of getting it in service for the LA Olympics (this movie is circa 1982).  Never one to go by the book, and with the help of fellow flyer Lymangood (Dan Stern), Murphy takes the super-chopper on an unauthorized jaunt and discovers the dark secret of Blue Thunder's purpose, uncovering proof of a massive conspiracy to turn LA into a police state governed by a fleet of gunships.  When the conspirators - who include a sinister pilot (Malcom McDowell) who was also Murphy's Commander in Vietnam - realize they face exposure, they kill Lyman and set their sites on Murphy.  Driven to desperation, Murphy hijacks the machine, stalling for time until his girlfriend (Candy Clarke) can find the proof that Lyman left behind revealing the truth about Blue Thunder.  The police and the military pull out every stop to bring Murphy down - missiles, fighters and other choppers.  Murphy's solutions are pretty inventive, but you know that these are only previews for the big one - the major dogfight between Scheider and Macdowell over the streets of LA.\nBlue Thunder is actually pretty smart, obscured though by how much fun it is.  The first half, before we see the super-copter show its moves, is wonderfully paranoid, with an eerie electronic score and wonderfully spastic camera movements (now ruined in countless episodes of NYPD Blue).  Schieder and Stern develope this great dialog (mostly ad-libbed) that keeps things flowing, Macdowell is great as the evil Colonel and Warren Oates - though underused - is also excellent as Scheider's boss.  The flight-scenes are incredibly choreographed and have yet to be surpassed (after nearly 20 years!?!?).\nAll in all, a great flick.";Top Gun meets the X-Files

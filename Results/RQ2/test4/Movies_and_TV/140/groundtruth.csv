Do not buy this if you are a Helen Mirren fan.  However, if you are a male of a certain age (45-60) and can remember the thrill of finding a copy of ""Playboy"" or ""Penthouse"" magazine in your neighbors garbage can, and longed to see the girls in the photos actually doing it, boy, is this movie for you!  The ONLY reason to buy this movie is for the orgy scene, which features actual Penthouse Pets from the 1970's frolicking about in a cocaine fueled debauch I'm certain they all came to regret as the years went by.  Admittedly, the action is relatively tame by today's perverted, internet-age standards, but back in 1979 girls in high end men's magazines simply didn't do that stuff.  I've bought every version of this film since it came out (VHS, DVD) and this Blu-ray had material even I've never seen before (behind the scenes stuff, including new material from the aforementioned orgy, as well as the two ""making of"" documentaries included in the ""Imperial Edition"" DVD I bought a couple of years ago).  If the names Anekka Di Lorenzo, Jane Hargrave, Bonnie Dee Wilson, and Lori Wagner mean anything to you, you simply MUST have this.

114;2.0;4.0;455.0;-258.87842857142846;"Caligula, one of the most controversial movies ever made, is now available on DVD.  This film was a real eye-opener for me, and the DVD is far superior to the VHS that was floating around a bit in the '80s (for all you  people complaining about the quality, just shudder to think of how it used  to be).  The story of Rome's infamous emperor was probably not this wild in  real life, but this is Penthouse and as a result is chockablock with sexual  scenes and graphic violence.  Because Caligula is basically in every single  scene, it's hard for the other characters to develop, but there are some  colorful supporting players, and McDowell really delivers.  It's hard to  believe his next film was to play the reserved, scholarly H.G. Wells  (""Time After Time."")  He is quite a talented actor.  The movie  drags on and on, and sometimes the cinematography is uncertain, but other  times it is dead on the money.  The film is a bit grainy on DVD, but as  someone else once said, this really contributes to the ""gritty""  factor.  As far as realism, many of the sex scenes look real, but I doubt  the world has ever seen the likes of that purple-skinned four-eyed (or was  it three-eyed?) woman, plus the guy with all those extra digits and the  siamese twins joined at the head resting at Tiberius' palace.  And how  about the scene where Caligula ""consecrates"" that marriage...if  that's how it was, I'd never get married.\nThe DVD has these things  going for it: the creepy music added to the menu (the same as the opening  title with the quote from Mark), the 30 chapters nicely divided up, the  documentary about the making of featuring Gore Vidal and Bob Guccione  (although in places everyone's face looked way too pale, but it was an old  '70s film), and the sound is far superior to the VHS from what I can  remember.\nBut this is Caligula and I would definitely not let anyone  under 18 (or maybe even 21) watch it.";Judge it for yourself
101;3.0;2.0;408.0;-637.6414366998576;"I will concentrate on the movie's historical accuracy (or its lack of it), since the previous reviews seem to either have overlooked it, or claimed that it is ""historically accurate"", or on the opposite extreme, that it totally ignored history.\n""Caligula"" does have some merit from the historical point of view, surely already present in Gore Vidal's original script. It's also very weak in many points.\nThe bare events of Caligula's life and reign are actually quite accurate. It may surprise many viewers that most of the secondary characters - Emperor Tiberius, Senator Nerva, the praetorian prefect Macro, Tiberius's grandson and Caligula's rival for the succession Gemellus, Caesonia, Chaerea (who murdered Caligula), his sister Drusilla - were all historical and, as far as the facts have come down to us, their portrayal in ""Caligula"" was fairly accurate, at least according to some ancient authors.\nTiberius did retire to the island of Capri in his last years and did invite the elderly Nerva to join him there, and ancient authors do claim that he indulged in sexual perversions there. Nerva really committed suicide as shown in the movie.\nThe conversations between Caligula, Nerva and Tiberius, probably by Vidal, really reflect contemporary views and issues - for instance, the deification of Julius Caesar and Augustus, Tiberius's predecessors: Tiberius was totally cynical about the whole thing, whereas Caligula firmly believed it. Throughout the movie, many of Caligula's lines come straight from ancient authors.\nOn the other hand, Nerva's comment on Caligula's ""gift for logic"" seems to owe more to Camus than to ancient sources - still, a nice touch, I thought.\nTiberius's murder by Caligula and Macro, Caligula's removal of Macro and Gemellus, his incestuous relationship with Drusilla, her death, his marriage to Caesonia, her giving him a daughter, his increasing tyranny, his farcical invasion of Germany and attempted invasion of Britain, and his murder by his own guard - are all historical facts, and on the whole not too inaccurately shown in the movie.\nOn the other hand, the movie's biggest weaknesses from the historical point of view are (1) the way it *looks* and (2) the suggestion that Caligula's and Tiberius's depravity were somehow ""normal"", part of Rome's ""decadence"".\nThe sets and clothes all look more like something from a Fellini film than from ancient Rome. Tiberius's palace on Capri is perhaps the most unrealistic, along with that ship, and the execution machine - and countless details.\nThe clothes aren't very realistic, either. Romans were more casual about nudity than we are today, and I suppose that their clothes might reveal much some times. But I doubt that Roman ladies would be as casual about parading half-naked as portrayed in the movie (I mean in normal situations, not the sex scenes).\nMoreover, it's simply not true that ""orgies"" such as that portrayed in the movie were common among the Roman upper classes. Actually adultery - also on the part of males - was an offense punishable by death, at least for the upper classes (this didn't cover prostitution). The vast majority of the Roman senatorial class would, and did, find behavior such as that of Tiberius and Caligula scandalous.\nHowever, Caligula's in cognito wanderings through Rome after Drusilla's death give perhaps for the first time in a movie a good impression of what ancient Rome actually was at night - dangerous, dark, chaotic, where no person of means would venture without an armed escort.\nI also enjoyed the glimpse of what an emperor's routine largely consisted of, with Tiberius and Caligula stamping their seal onto endless piles of official documents.\n""Caligula"" was obviously intended to be mainly a pornographic movie - Bob Guccione made sure of that. But it also, at some point, was intended to have a core of historical accuracy, which is why Gore Vidal was asked to write the script.\nThis core is still present in the movie, and it's not true that you don't learn anything of Roman history by watching it.\nBut of course, I know that that's not what most people will watch it for. So perhaps Guccione was right.";From the historical point of view, not as bad as many think
40;4.0;4.0;260.0;-268.2472334293948;"This new Imperial 3 disc edition of CALIGULA from Image and Penthouse is an ""everything and the kitchen sink"" affair.  It should be a must buy for fans of the film, and offers two unique ways of viewing the infamous film known mostly for its peversity.\n\nDisc One contains an unrated X-rated version including all the Bob Guccione inserted scenes of somewhat hardcore sex acts.  The editing is a little off as Guccione assembled this cut from what Tinto Brass directed and put some scenes out of order thus blurring the narrative and character development.\n\nDisc Two contains a pre-release cut of the film without the hardcore scenes, and a more logical progression of scenes assembled to depict the order Tinto Brass wanted them in.  It runs 3 minutes shorter, and you'll notice alternate footage in many scenes.  Three commentaries are delivered over this version with Malcolm McDowell on one, Helen Mirren on the second, and Ernest Volkman on the final track.  Each are joined by authors and film critics who help keep the conversation flowing and on topic.  Also included are a dozen cut and alternate takes.\n\nThe third disc contains featurettes, interviews, and archival footage from the production.  A 1980 documentary proves interesting and provides more graphic footage.\n\nThe transfer is improved, but still looks blurred and lacking in contrast.  The reason for some of this is the movie was shot like a magazine spread with soft focus cameras.  It's never super clear, and there's plenty of grain and digital artifacts to contend with.\n\nThis is the best the film has ever looked, and has tons of extra material to wade through.  A dream for collectors, and a nightmare for the detractors.  The film is dispassionate and brutal - depicting every peversity you could imagine and then some.  Costumes and sets are amazing - including a five story machine that decapitates heads in a colisseum.  Breathtaking for all the wrong reasons, CALIGULA is about ego out of control.  Oddly enough those that made it suffered from the same malady.";Awesome Extras and Two Cuts of the Film

111;6.0;5.0;213.0;-218.55374999999998;"This movie is a masterpiece in that it accomplishes what it set out to do: to depict decadent, pagan Rome circa 37 AD. I cringed throughout the FIRST  VIEWING, unsure what to expect, fearing revulsion in each scene. The SECOND  VIEWING was better, I knew what to expect: a simple plot about unchecked  power with gratuitous violence and sex. Guccione may have overstated the  sex and violence but that is what you get from pagan cultures. The THIRD  VIEWING reveals the movie as art: as pornographic and dangerous as ancient  Rome at its worst with interesting props and sets. Maybe Guccione wanted to  contrast sexual cultures of ancient Rome with his magazine culture of  today: to prove that he himself and/or current exploitation of women isn't  so bad after all--only sexually explicit. Generally, sex of any kind still  has a bad reputation.  This movie only needs be a reasonably accurate  historical account (ostensibly derived from museum artifacts commonly found  around the world) to maintain historical relevance. Many will hate this  sort of reality, but not every movie has to ""sublimate"" reality  according to family movie standards to please puritanical hypocrites. Face  it: only a world as lost as Caligula's could crucify Christ.  (Notice how  persecution against the spiritually pure was greatest then?) Yes (?)  Nevertheless, this movie entertains by being so over-the-top that exquisite  sound and editing are not necessary. Again, this was the real Rome.  Finally, if you are an adult who desires full knowledge of the depth of  human depravity, then Vidal, Guccione, et al. should be praised for  accomplishing such an important (by virtue of its controversy) historical  film. I recommend this film to everyone to either love or hate. I love it!";Porno or poor movie, absolutely unique among movies
102;7.0;3.0;138.0;-307.5618041237113;"Some epics are famous for their content.  Braveheart, for instance, revitalized interest in William Wallace and might be credited with drumming up support for the Scottish National Party and the new Scottish Parliament.  Others are famous for their quirks; Spartacus director Stanley Kubrick employed the ""Hollywood Ten"" blacklist, a group of people accused of communist activities by the McCarthy witchunt.  Still others, like Lawrence of Arabia, are so unique in their locations, subject matter, and cinematographic pioneering that they top the list of influences of every major movie director - and a lot of the minor directors, too.\nCaligula, on the other hand, is famous for being the most expensive pornography film ever created.\nI'm not going to bother summarizing plot, as there really isn't any to speak of.  Obstinately, it's a historical epic about Emperor Caligula, the ruler that was responsible for such excellent history-class tibits as naming his horse a Senator and marching the Roman Garrison into the ocean because he'd declared war on Neptune, drowning them by the thousands.  And you thought our presidents were bad!  The movie, from a script by Gore Vidal (that he attempted to disown), details Caligula's personal insanity, including his incestuous relationships with his sister and the forces that plot against him, both real and imaginary.\nSay what you will about the film, it is still a $15 million porno flick, with better actors than usual.  If you're going to take the plunge to buy it, then get the blue-packaged Unrated version.  Not only does it have the extra hardcore, but it is the only one with 5.1 sound and the interview segment with Gore Vidal himself.  The DVD is OK; the title screens are well-done, but the video transfer looks almost like a VHS tape, fuzzy and full of dust.  Sound, at least on the Unrated version, is decent, making full use of all channels, but it is pretty obvious that the soundtrack wasn't remastered for the DVD release.\nIf you're feeling particularly masochistic, there's no reason to add this title to your collection, other than just to have it there.  Fans should pay the extra for the Unrated version, but anyone who hasn't seen it will probably want to make the trip to their local video store first.";Umm...  OK.
116;8.0;4.0;116.0;-151.51746835443035;The first time I saw this movie, it was playing at a local art film theater. I had heard about how graphic this film was in every respect. I wasn't led astray. Despite its explicit nature, Caligula is quite a good  film. Malcolm McDowell(who, in my opinion, is in the top 10 greatest actors  of all time)is very good, as always, as are Peter O'Toole, Helen Mirren,  and Sir John Gielgud. They more than make up for a few corny (some  downright stupid) plot and visual elements.  The plot revolves around  Caligula, a young man who becomes emperor of Rome after he has his uncle,  the current emperor, killed. It takes the viewer through a graphic (yet  historically accurate)display of the decadence of ancient Rome(with very  convincing set pieces) as it shows Caligula's slow decline into insanity.  Before viewing this film keep in mind that it is very graphic in its  violence and sex (unless you're viewing the R-rated version that has almost  1 hour cut from its original running time). Also keep in mind that although  it is graphic, it is also (for the most part)historically accurate. So, if  you want to see some of the most impressive sets in recent memory & a  few of the world's greatest thesbians at work and beleive you can handle  its extreme nature, I would definatly give Caligula a try.;McDowell Delivers!

Most of the more revealing scenes featuring Malcolm McDowell and Heleln Mirren have been deleted, probably at the request or insistence of the now embarrassed performers.  As an edited version the film makes even less sense an is more tedious than the original version.  Still, it is enjoyable to watch Peter O'Toole making a meal of the scenery and John Gielgud forcing a heroic effort to treat the nonsense production with a degree of Shakespearian gravitas.;Unacknowledged Edited Version
46;10.0;1.0;44.0;-905.5838100102144;Caligula is an utter mess of a film if only for the sole purpose that the possibilities for the concept itself were pretty good ones.  Gaius Caligula Caesar's rise to power and ultimate early fall and assassination is a story worth telling a million times over, especially in the daring form of an X-rated film.  It is a direct warning to the social ills of power in the wrong hands and cultural excess. There seemed to be a superstar lineup for this unique idea.  Peter O'Toole, Helen Mirren and John Guilguild are three great actors.  The film is directed by Italy's racy Tinto Brass and produced by the editor of Penthouse Magazine who brought a bunch of his girls to `co-star' when things got too hot for the real actors.  It co-stars an exhibitionist model Theresa Ann Savoy and the lead is played by the insane and undeniable presence of Malcolm McDowell.  So what the hell happened?  Gore Vidal wrote an awful screenplay and Brass seemed to have problems with the writer wanting all of the credit for the film. This conflict itself along with all the other ego issues probably contributed to its failure.  I also think it is entirely possible that all of the focus, costs and discipline were replaced with piles and piles of uncut cocaine.  Seriously though, the set must've been one enormous party and as we see it was at times a real-life orgy and acting became secondary.  The flaws are almost wholly directorial in nature.  I feel for the cast because the guys behind the scenes had no idea what to do so why bother delivering a decent performance?\n\nAnyway, the rumors of Caligula's insanity and the stories that exhibit this were tossed into the picture in spurts and the film follows, and perhaps even sets the standard for, many of the varied cliches applied in shocking the hell out of its audience.  The film stands as a landmark for this alone.  You will not forget Caligula but you may want to forget just how exploitative and stupid it really is.  It's not a movie as much as it is an attempt to hold the title as most disturbing footage ever filmed.  To draw a parallel, I think of the scene were O'Toole's Tiberius is showing Caligula his circus of sex and freaks.  It is almost as if this idea of showing just how indecent and indulgent he has become to Caligula mirrors the intentions of the film itself to it's audience.  I don't believe this is intentional as that would give too many morons too much credit.  I will credit Bob Guccione of Penthouse for adding the hardcore scenes after the film, because let's face it the R-rated version is completely disposable.  You got that?  Don't waste any of your time on that version because everything that the film Caligula sets out to accomplish is on display exclusively on the unrated version.  Guccione probably imagined that his director and writer could inject some artistic merit while he brought his merry band of naked women.  As egotistical as he is, I'm not sure he can be blamed...he kind of did his job.\n\nAllow me to point out a few key scenes and why they are monumentally shameless and disqualify Caligula from being a real movie. At the beginning of the movie we see Caligula dancing around, chasing and flirting with his sister Drusilla (Theresa Ann Savoy).  The scene's only purpose is to tease the audience with Savoy's body.  She is hardly dressed and by the end of the scene we get a look between her bum cheeks, and then the title of the film appears and the dramatic score is cued.  Why now?  What about the exit of Savoy's lower gastro-intestinal system represents Caligula as a horrible individual or makes any kind of social commentary at all?  It seemed like kind of a strange place to emphasize the direction of the film, although it sure is consistent with what follows.  Moments later (after naked men break rocks or something) we get even closer and more lingering shots at Savoy's intimate areas as she begins rolling around in bed with her brother.  The film goes on and on like this focusing on different sexual acts and parts of the body, which I guess is all Tinto Brass really does anyway.\n\nJudging from behind the scenes extras with Guccione's ranting about some kind of vision, this film is even more unforgivable and ostentatious.  We see blatant fellatio up close and graphic about four or five times, actual brief penetration twice, a long and completely random girl-on-girl scene, a girl peeing on a dead castrated man, people being impaled, a guy being forced to drink whine and then stabbed in the stomach and several other odd things I probably shouldn't get into (I think I've said quite enough).  All of this in the name of what?  It's a mixture of mindless motives because this film is lost.  It says nothing.\n\nNotice I refused to make comments on historical accuracy.  Firstly, it is hard to accurately portray something two thousand years old.  Secondly, the film is not convincing.  I don't believe for one nanosecond that any of these characters remotely represent the real people from that real era.  Historical commentary can only be made within a compelling context to begin with.  Theoretically, there could've been something to say here and the film is a complete failure in doing so.  I would love to see someone try to take this story on again, if only to create a film that is this controversial in addition to a film that is actually smart.  This notorious movie fails on so many levels.;Monumental Filmaking Failure.

Is it porn? No, it isn't. When you have that urge to view porn, Caligula is not the first film you rent......too much plot. It has many hardcore sex scenes, but this was all part of an enormous failed experiment: To bring porn scenes to legitimate film. It didn't work, this film is a disaster. But because of this, the film is very entertaining. The first time you see it you won't believe what you're watching. You'll be asking yourself, ""How?"", ""Why?"", etc. Regardless if you love it or hate it, you'll sit through the entire two and and half hours of it just out of morbid curiosity and bewilderment. The same impulse that makes you slow down as you drive past an accident on the highway. I'm not quite sure what Gore Vidal was thinking here; Wouldn't you think that if you got Bob Guccione and Tinto Brass involved in your film that it would be overflowing with sleaze? Gore can't be that dumb! In the documentary it's hilarious to watch him talk about the historical and philosophical importance of the movie. I bet he feels like a total schmuck and totally ashamed now when he thinks back on that. I'd love to ask him about it. The film tries to be accurate and take itself seriously as a drama, but lets cut through ... here; Guccione was merely using this as a way to push his sleaze into the mainstream and become an ""innovative genius"" in the public's eye. The sex scenes are very sleazy and disgusting because they're usually sandwiched between(or during) scenes of graphic violence, making them devoid of any kind of erotic value. I love showing or lending this movie to unsuspecting friends, coworkers, family, just to get their reaction. There will never be another movie like Caligula....ever.

There is no exclusive content on this high def release.  To call it high def isn't really correct because I don't suppose CALIGULA is ever going to look too great, even on Bluray. Nevertheless, the Bluray transfer offers a bit of an improvement over the DVD version, especially in the Alternative Version print.  The alternative footage has been re-mastered for this edition so that the footage matches the quality of the rest of the film.  This is a huge improvement over the DVD which left the ""new"" footage faded and dirty.  The colors of CALIGULA have never looked better than they do here although there is still an excessive amount of grain in many scenes due to the condition of the source material.  This edition includes a smaller sized version of the booklet included with the DVD edition.  Sadly, the beautiful fold out packagaing and slipcase are replaced by the cheap standard Blu ray case.  The edition is now on 2 discs instead of three.  If you love CALIGULA or collect the various video releases of this film, then this release is a must have.  It is the best CALIGULA has ever looked (although it is still far from perfect).\n\nDVD REVIEW\n\nThis new edition of CALIGULA is entirely superior to any previous video release of the film, in fact, I suspect it probably looks better here than it did in theatres.  Image has spared no expense in this stuning ""imperial"" edition, and it is so lavish and luxurious that it would have no doubt pleased the emperor Caligula himself.  The most important feature of this release is of course how the film looks and sounds.  I've owned every previous release of this film (including the Beta video tape and the LaserDisc) and I truly felt like I was watching the movie for the first time.  CALIGULA is never going to look too sharp and clear, simply because of the way Tinto Brass photographed it, but I think in this edition we now have the film in it's ultimate form.  The colors are bright and vibrant and background details of the awesome sets by Danilo Donati can now be seen for the first time.  Lines of dialogue that I had never been able to make out before now come clearly from my speakers for the first time.  It is simply amazing what Image has done with the prints.  Speaking of which, we now have an entirely new cut of the film and it is a masterwork.  Gone is all of Bob Guccione's hardcore pornography (and lets face it, that is what it was) and instead we are able to see for the first time the beautiful footage that Brass shot for scenes like the Tiberius Grotto and the Bordello ship.  The film also unfolds differently with scenes restored to their intended running order as scripted by Gore Vidal.  The woods sequence no longer opens the film but appears (in an extended form with never before seen footage) in it's proper place in the middle of the film.  I will say that the editing on all of the new footage is a bit rough and it does not appear to have been ""cleaned up"" as much as the rest of the film stock but this is a minor complaint.  /  Still there is so much more to this edition of CALIGULA than just the two cuts of the film.  There are three theatrical trailers that are real treasures.  There are also three marvelous commentary tracks from Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren and journalist Ernest Volkman.  These often humorous commentaries alone would be worth the price of the video but there is SO MUCH MORE.  There is a half hour interview with John ""Longinus"" Steiner.  A full half hour interview with Lori Wagner, the actress who played Agripina (or was it Messillina?) in the Guccione porn footage.  Most importantly there is an in depth interview with director Tinto Brass that is fascinating.  AND STILL THERE IS MORE MORE MORE!  How about an hours worth of deleted and extended scenes?  This footage has not been remastered and it is often in rough shape but it is still amazing to see it.  There is also around an hours worth of behind the scenes footage.  The DOCUMENTARY ON THE MAKING OF GORE VIDAL'S CALIGULA is imported here from the 20th Anniversary DVD release but this time there are TWO VERSIONS, one long and one short (can you believe it?).  There are also extensive still photo archives that will take you a long time to watch and trust me, these photos are worth looking at and they will show you a lot about how CALIGULA was made.  There are loads of photos of Tinto Brass directing as well as fotos of Gore ""I'm taking my name off this"" Vidal on the set.  As if all this was not enough, you can put the disc in your computer and read not one but two versions of the Gore Vidal screenplay as well as the complete novel based on the screenplay.  There are also photos of the Penthouse Pets who did the porno footage as well as an unintentionally funny interview with Bob Guccione.  Now we all owe a great debt to Bob, without whom there would have been no CALIGULA (at least not as we know it today) but I've gotta say that he comes off as a pretty crazy fellow in the magazine interviews and to here him blathering on interminably about ""art"" and ""excellence"" and trying to appear sophisticated had me doubled over with laughter.  Not surprisingly, no one in the commentaries or interviews has much nice to say about him (Tinto Brass gives him the easiest time I suppose) but if Bob had not decided to take an already risque film and insert some explicit porn into it, I doubt very much whether we would still be sitting around talking about CALIGULA today.  And now we have the best of both worlds because those who love CALIGULA for its porno aspects have disc one and those who love CALIGULA as a historical art film have disc two, and those who just want a cool fast paced sword and sandal kind of thing (or a version you can share with your grandmother) can buy the new R rated release that is sold seperately and also looks and sounds spectacular.  /  I forgot to mention that the imperial edition comes in a high quality slip case and fold out inner keepcase with beautiful artwork of the cast.  Each of the three discs feature a photo of a different cast member, McDowell, Mirren and O'Toole.  Now certainly this is the longest review I ever wrote for Amazon but it is also the most spectacular release I have ever seen of any DVD.  It truly sets a new standard for what a special edition should be.  Congratulations to all involved.";A spectacular new edition on Blu ray
79;19.0;1.0;33.0;-321.8349999999999;"Every fan of movies should be forced to watch Caligula as an ascetic exercise at least once.  For only in discovering how bad cinema can be are we able to fully appreciate how good it can be.  And the good news is that the film has a message- absolute power corrupts absolutely!  That is the end of the good news.\nAs an historical drama, Caligula completely fails to capture any sense of time and place.  While some of the scenes depicted (such as the Emperor Tiberius swimming with his ""little fishes"") are based on historical sources, it seems as though it could have taken place on Mars.  The sets and costumes are incredibly garish or silly, sacrificing any suspension of disbelief.  The camera work is amateurish- it zips around, losing its subject, and often delivering an unclear picture due to what seems to be inadequate lighting or a failure to focus on the subject.  The picture is grainy throughout and tough on the eyes.\nAs an ""artistic"" hard core porno flick, Caligula is boring and not the slightest bit titillating.  The sexuality is displayed between frequent and extremely gruesome acts of violence (the multitude of which I will not catalogue here, suffice it to say the movie should not be watched while eating).  Also, when trying to advance the plot (if Caligula has one), the hard core scenes are exasperating in their ability to delay the progression and break down whatever narrative quality the film might have had.\nOther reviews speak adequately as to the story of how this train wreck of a movie occurred, so I won't go into it.  I can suggest, however, that you will likely never see such an A-list cast in such an awful movie ever again.  The included documentary is laughable- Guccione is really convinced he is making a truly important film, and the casting reflects that.\nNow, the only dramatic alternative I know of to Caligula that covers the same period is ""I, Claudius"".  While Claudius runs 668 minutes and Caligula runs 155, I can guarantee you that the latter seems to go on much longer; forever, in fact.  You emerge from viewing it wondering what in the world you just watched, and whether or not viewing a film can actually make you a less noble person.  But I know you are curious... so have at it, just remember you were warned!";Tries to be many things and fails at all of them.

82;21.0;5.0;30.0;-662.1189795918367;"A few years back there was quite a controversy over some shot-on-video garbage called 'Baise Moi' solely on it's inclusion of hardcore pornography (I have a bootleg and believe me it's a mere 30 secs over the total running time of the film). A lot of sheltered mainstream viewers were confused and bewildered, but there was nothing original or daring about 'Baise Moi'. Needless to say all the attention cast a great spotlight on an otherwise worthless film and the people responsible for it made off like bandits. Anyone who was ""shocked"" by 'Baise Moi' should definitely stay away from Caligula, which makes the overhyped 'Baise Moi' look PG-13 by comparison!\nTowards the end of the 70's there was a vibe that pornography would be absorbed into mainstream movies. Not too far fetched considering then X-rated films such as 'Midnight Cowboy' and 'Clockwork Orange' were winning awards and critical acclaim, also in Europe there were plenty of horror/exploitation films that blended full blown pornography into the genre for example Joe D'amato's 'Emanuelle in America' 'Erotic Night of the Living Dead' 'Porno Holocaust', Jess Franco's 'Female Vampire' 'Doriana Grey', Jean Rollin had put out a few and there was a fantastic little film called 'Thriller:a Cruel Picture' which should be out on DVD early this year! With this in mind Bob Guccione got the rights to a Gore Vidal screen play, hired top actors Malcom McDowell, Peter O'Tool and Helen Mirren then enlisted the services of Italian director Tinto Brass (who later removed his name after Guccione shot extra scenes) to create the most expensive porno in history.\nI must admit I thoroughly enjoyed Caligula and genuinely feel it's a great film! A lot of people nit pick small historic anomalies or make unfounded blanket statements such as ""the acting was bad"" or ""the story was pointless"" to hide the fact that their own prudish tastes and inhibitions won't allow them to accept Caligula as the daring and unique piece of film making that it is. Now I respect the opinions of people who say Caligula is too graphic for them or there were scenes which offended them as make no mistake about it there are scenes in this film which will alienate anyone who isn't familiar with quite sordid pornography. Plenty of intelligent viewers will surely consider this film to be in bad taste, which is perfectly acceptable. However ignore intellectual posers who would have you believe this film is worthless simply because they are not big enough to say ""personally I did not like it"". Too many small minded people have the out dated view that all pornography is evil and while it's acceptable that not everybody is into porn, please do take a look where this book burning mentality leads before you endorse the ideals of censorship.\nIf you want to accuse this film of being historically inaccurate, pointless, badly directed and poorly acted, you should go write reviews for 'Titanic' 'Pearl Harbor' and 'Moulin Rouge' first. Caligula has more style and resonance than all of those films put together. For better or worse Caligula would surely get a more powerful reaction from an audience than any film you could see in the cinema today. Let's face it Hollywood has not produced anything vaguely original or challenging in more than a decade.\nAnother thing which irritates me is all these haters who attack Teresa Ann Savoy for her ""bad acting"". I feel she is a fine actress, so what if she doesn't mind taking her clothes off. Julia Roberts today gets the fattest paychecks for a female actor and she has done nothing but star in meaningless garbage and is incapable of playing anything but the same shallow character. Savoy is cool, sexy and has great expressiveness. Check out her other Tino Brass film 'Salon Kitty'.\nImage Entertainment's DVD is good, but for those who are true fans of this film you may want to check out the remastered 2-disc French release available from amazon France. For those who are prudish or sensitive viewers, give Caligula a miss altogether, theres a new 'Troy' movie coming out with Brad Pitt which would better suite you.\nPS If anybody knows where you can pick up a copy of the mythical 210 minute version, I would greatly appreciate an email!";Real Horrorshow Cine!

Bob  Guccione sponsored this film through production but was unsatisfied by the  amount of nudity director Tinto Brass had filmed.  So, he stormed the set  at night with some Penthouse Pets and added a good bit of hardcore porn to  the movie.  So, rather than getting an amazingly boring Roman epic (as  Brass' footage indicates), we get the same boring film with some grotesque,  over-the-top pornography.  Of course, nothing about this movie is  subtle--McDowell gives an exaggerated imitation of his role from A  Clockwork Orange, yet fails to make us fear him the way that earlier role  did.  The violence is nasty beyond words.  In fact, the excessively bloody  sexual mutilation and decapitation ruins any erotic potential the movie's  numerous sex scenes had. The script is full of cheesy dialogue, making me  wonder how much actually came from Gore Vidal's original screenplay.  (Both  Vidal and Brass now disown the film.)  To make matters worse, the quality  of the print is horrible.  The cinematography is dull and dark, and the  costumes seemed designed merely to provide easy access to the actor's  bodies.  If you are still interested after all of these negatives, consider  the film's ungodly length of almost two and a half hours.  Are you sure you  want to do this?  If I haven't turned you away by now, by all means order  this DVD.  Don't say you weren't warned.;Oh, please!

To see spliced-in pornographic acts performed in a film so sumptuously photographed blurs our aesthetics; or it did mine, anyway.  Whatever the final opinion, it was definitely never boring.  Along with the nearly constant atrocities stemming from a complete abuse and debasement of power, it has stunning visuals going for it.  Therefore a revitalized hi-def transfer makes an excellent opportunity to see it afresh.  After watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Caligula-Blu-ray/dp/B001DWNUCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Caligula [Blu-ray</a>] (""The Imperial Edition""), and delving into all the extras, I've concluded that, despite its many flaws, it is indeed a good film.  By all accounts, it could have been a GREAT film, but as often is the case with ambitious visions, conflicts led to too many compromises, eventuating to no one's satisfaction.  There will never be a critical consensus on it, but still, anyone interested in films has to conclude it has its merits.  This edition makes that obvious.\n\nTo sum it up, Malcolm McDowell plays Caligula as mirthfully cruel, irreverent, and giddily insane.  John Gielgud, making an early departure, plays with erect Shakespearean dignity Tiberius' only friend, the wise Nerva, contemptuous of the inevitable scenario of Rome's further decline at Caligula's ascendancy.  Peter O'Toole portrays Tiberius as demoralized and sardonically embittered by the trappings of power, his face scabby and scalp clumpy from the ravages of syphilis.  Once Tiberius dies -- all of the actors with major theater credentials exit relatively early -- Caligula has the playground of Rome all to himself.\n\nHaving never seen the remastered SD special edition released a couple of years ago, I'm unable to compare its image quality to the transfer on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Caligula-Blu-ray/dp/B001DWNUCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Caligula [Blu-ray</a>].  But I can state with certainty that this Blu-ray edition is far superior to the initial DVD issued back in the 1990s.  Art director and costume designer Danilo Donati gave cinematographer Silvano Ippoliti a lively palette and grand designs to work with, and it's illuminated here.  While the age of the print is apparent at times, the hi-def transfer revives the lost vibrancy of the draped luxury and pillared architecture.  And aside from the brighter picture, there's a cornucopia tucked away in the special features.\n\nThe extras include two versions of ""The Making of Caligula""; interviews (about 30 minutes each) with director Tinto Brass, actor John Steiner (who portrayed Longinus), and Penthouse pet Lori Wagner (who, in hindsight, realizes she was in way over her head, thanks to her blind ambition); three audio commentaries (McDowell, Helen Mirren, and on-set writer Ernest Volkman); an alternate pre-release version of the film; and, rounding out the set, the usual odds and ends (deleted scenes, theatrical trailers, and so on).  This two-disc edition comes with a 15-page booklet detailing the film's troubled production, in which the essayist R. J. Buffalo concludes passionately that a full restoration to its original vision is in order.  It's a hell-freezes-over probability.  From the artifacts among the bonus features, it's obvious that two immutable creative forces were in direct conflict.  Gore Vidal, who wrote the original screenplay, eventually disavowed the film when director Brass altered how Caligula himself was presented.  It must have come down to an interpretation of the script, because Vidal's earlier version is included as a DVD-ROM extra, and a lot of the dialogue was retained, some of it word for word.  So, on the one hand, you have Brass wanting a sexually explicit, anarchistic romp; on the other you have Vidal's depiction of Caligula as derisive of the ruling class, and abuses power as mockery.  The result is a schizophrenic montage.  In my judgment, Vidal's vision edges out ahead slightly, as by the time you get to all that explicit sex, they're not festivities you'd want to be invited to.  So the question remains, to whose vision would the final edit be restored?\n________________________________________";The Imperial Edition (Blu-ray)
14;25.0;3.0;18.0;-2218.466746031746;"As usual Amazon have lumped all the reviews of the different versions of this film together - the four disc UK PAL 'Imperial Edition' this review refers to, the one-disc uncut version, the one-disc cut version, the three-disc US version, the BluRay (which includes the uncut version and the extras but not the alternate cuts)...\n\nWhat to make of the notorious Caligula? It's not really porno, not really an epic, not really a drama - it's just a kind of Mulligan's Stew of a movie. The film is a mess and exists in lots of versions, with the three on the UK DVD not even covering half of them. The hardcore sex in the infamous unrated cut that was added by producer and Penthouse magazine owner Bob Guccione (who looks like a blinged up 70s Caesar in the accompanying documentary and who made the film as a tax deductible write-off against Penthouse's publishing profits) after shooting was finished has surprisingly been left uncut by the UK censors. Yet for all their publicity value, the porn inserts are more distracting than arousing and curious for what was intended as a mainstream commercial porn film because there's such an awful lot of male nudity in the unerotic unsimulated sex among the extras that it makes you wonder what team the producer was batting for.\n\nDespite legend, they're not the sole reason director Tinto Brass and writer Gore Vidal disowned the film: the former did so because much of it was re-edited out of sequence after he was fired in post-production, the later because his script was changed so much (Brass ended up with a `principal photography by' credit while the only writing credit is `based on a script by Gore Vidal'). The original intention to make a more historically accurate and defiantly pagan Roman epic outside the studio system without the restrictions of a PG rating would be better achieved more than a quarter of a century later with HBO's Rome, while at the time it looked like a pale shadow of the BBC's noticeably much lower funded but infinitely better written I, Claudius. Unfortunately Malcolm McDowell wanted to play Caligula as an anarchist destroying Rome from within rather than just another madman - a potentially intriguing interpretation - but pointedly didn't want to do any gay scenes despite playing a bisexual. The producer was more interested in the box-office potential of an X-rated epic. It was never going to end happily for anyone concerned...\n\nIt's not exactly historically accurate, but then with Caligula running a close second to Nero as cinema's favorite mad emperor and most surviving accounts of his reign highly partisan, that's perhaps not too surprising. Caligula was actually one of the most popular Caesars with the public in his lifetime, initiating major reforms that made life better for the plebs while increasingly frustrating the senate and aristocracy, who had been running things their way for years in Tiberius' absence and didn't like suddenly being second best. The first two years of his reign were something of a golden age: the economy boomed, he started no wars, caused no major disasters and killed surprisingly few people, none of them members of his immediate family (a bit of a rarity for a Caesar), and even reintroduced democracy and instituted tax cuts and civic building programmes. And when his behavior did become more questionable, it was generally the upper class who bore the brunt of it rather than the unwashed masses. Indeed, so extraordinarily popular was Caligula with the people at the time of his assassination that attempts to restore the Republic were thwarted by mass demonstrations of public anger.\n\nWhile there's general agreement his reign deteriorated after a near fatal illness and mental illness, most of the worst stories of his madness and perversion come from Suetonius' gloriously gossipy Lives of the Twelve Caesars, written 80 years after his death, so it's probable that despite his promiscuity the stories of incestuous relations with three of his sisters and the more outrageous acts of insanity that captured the public imagination for centuries may not even be true (it was fairly common practice to highlight and exaggerate earlier emperor's failings to make the current incumbent look better, something Suetonius would have been well aware of as the Emperor Hadrian's secretary). Indeed, even the name Caligula is something of a misnomer. He ruled as Gaius Caesar Germanicus: Caligula was a childhood nickname given to him by his father's troops meaning `bootikins' or little boots (caligulae), and its use after his death was a good way of belittling him as a figure of infantile ridicule as he became a victim of the same negative political spin that he himself pioneered against his predecessor, Tiberius. He was certainly a very flawed individual: paranoid, promiscuous with both sexes yet sanctimoniously moralistic, theatrical, mentally ill (possibly as a result of neurosyphilis) and often unnecessarily combative with little realpolitikal acumen, though they're not uncommon qualities in rulers (you could almost see him as the ancient world's King Ludwig of Bavaria). He wasn't a great Caesar by any standards, but he wasn't a particularly bad or monstrous one compared to many that followed him either, and he doesn't fit any standard definition of a tyrant. But then, given the choice between a flawed mentally ill reformer and a raving tyrannical madman, authors and filmmakers have always opted to print the legend. And with Caligula, they finally got the chance to film all the mucky bits the censors never would have let them get away with in the 50s and 60s.\n\nIt does have a car-crash fascination, though, and you can see the film it once wanted to be from time to time, as well as why it went so wrong. You'll have McDowell, Peter O'Toole (made up like a lecherous Albert Steptoe ogling his `little fishes') and John Gielgud speaking elegant Gore Vidal dialogue while extras play with themselves in the background, often in shots taken from completely different parts of the movie. It's shot on huge stages that are part Las Vegas (you almost expect Siegfried and Roy to turn up doing the floor show), part grand opera, with proscenium arch staging to match. Part Fellini-wannabe, part Visconti-wannabe, the over-riding impression at times is that it's the kind of film King Ludwig of Bavaria would have made.\n\nDespite all the excess the $17.5m budget could buy back in 1976 and the odd grand image like a giant mourning cloth slowly floating down on the whipped and cowering senators, it's not exactly a grand spectacle - the film rarely leaves the Palace, though there is one vivid street scene where play actors depict the Roman class system as a human pyramid with the people sandwiched between the army and the slaves at the bottom and Caligula angrily trying to bring the whole edifice crashing down. As the film progresses, he becomes more dedicated to chaos, reducing the senate to baaing like sheep after they make him a god, using their wives as whores, all the while thinking they are mad for approving everything he does. ""I don't know what else to do to provoke them,"" he laments at one point. Yet the film never seems to have an especially clear idea of what it wants to do or where it's going, the several years (!!!) it spent in the editing room and the uncredited rewrites during the nightmarish shoot all too apparent as it lurches along like a slightly distracted drunk caught somewhere between having drunk too much but still not quite enough.\n\nThe four-disc Imperial edition DVD available in the UK offers three different cuts of the film, none of them a director's cut. The first disc has the uncut X-rated version re-edited by Guccione, the second, described as an alternate `pre-release version,' an attempt to reconstruct something similar to Tinto Brass' original intentions that puts scenes back in their proper chronological order and drops some of the more gratuitous sexual footage such as Penthouse Pet Lori Wagner's lengthy lesbian scene, and - only in the UK set - a peculiar 102-minute R-rated cut from 1999. This short version isn't so much edited as hacked ruthlessly as if someone took it upon themselves to whip the uppity film into submission once and for all. It's not just the jarring and clumsy removal of most of the violence and the softcore as well as hardcore sex, it's the sheer nonsensical nature of the editing that strikes you. Cutting far more than the censors required - nearly an entire hour - it loses many of the film's most memorable and important moments (the humiliation of the newlywed couple, the fever that causes Caligula to believe himself a god and causes his sister's death), leaving the remnants often laughably bizarre nonsequiters or just plain confusing. Some of the cast in the credits are nowhere to be found in the UK version.\n\nThe set is certainly loaded with extras - three audio commentaries on the `pre-release version,' trailers, 79 minutes of home movie footage of the shoot, stills galleries and two early draft screenplay by Vidal among them. I know that sounds like saying you buy Playboy for the articles, but they are sometimes more fun than the film. The 48 minutes of deleted footage on the alternate version is deceptive - it's actually raw footage, much of it not even assembled, all mute and only about half of it in colour. Aside from one sequence of Caligula making love to his sister, the shots are either alternate takes of scenes in the film, trims or alternate angles of deleted scenes that feature on the UK edition's third disc. None add anything to the film, although the clumsily staged raw footage of unenthusiastic extras fumbling their way through the orgy at Tiberius' retreat and abruptly stopping every time they wrongly assume the camera is no longer on them does show how difficult it must be to shoot a decent sex scene.\n\nThe third UK disc includes another 31 minutes of deleted material taken from worn work prints that aren't included on the US DVD, including raw footage of the depravities in Tiberius' grotto and an additional 11 scenes in rough cut form, most of them cut from the latter section of the film after Drusilla's death that would have given the film a wider view of Caligula's reign and do show the much more ambitious but no more successful picture intended - much of the film's last third hit the cutting room floor on all versions, as did much of Helen Mirren's role. Unfortunately many of them simply aren't very good or don't quite work, such as Caligula avoiding raising taxes by theatrically setting himself above Jupiter and liberating the god's treasury, a scene not helped by awkward sped-up moments. Other scenes, such as the emperor replacing the heads of statues of the gods with his own head and rehearsing the camp march he makes the legionaries do at the imperial brothel, no longer have full sound and tend to spotlight some terrible work from John Steiner that would have undermined his character had they remained in the film. But McDowell's interest in making the character more of an anarchist comes over in a scene where he playfully plans famines and sea battles to liven things up while nimbly walking over desktops, makes his horse a senator to undermine the ruling class and appeal to the people and a lengthy bedroom scene with Helen Mirren about the dangers of goading and humiliating the senate. Without them, there's less of a sense of his continual emasculation of the old ruling class by piling on outrage after outrage building up to the point where his assassination becomes inevitable. There's also striking footage of his horse being chased by slaves as he dies twitching in the film's final scene, as well as the conclusion of the `Death Machine' sequence where he has his guards throw Proculus into its path only for him to survive.\n\nWhile a new documentary about the making of the film could be fascinating, the accompanying one-hour documentary on the DVD dates from the film's release, though it's hard to tell who it was made for since it includes a lot of hardcore footage that would have kept it off even cable TV. Sadly there's no input from Vidal, who sued Guccione to have the film retitled Gore Vidal's Caligula and then, on seeing it, sued again to have his name taken off, nor is there the infamous spoof trailer for a remake he, Mirren and director Francesco Vezzoli made in 2005. Director Tinto Brass, one of the Penthouse Pets who is now a living monument to Cher's plastic surgeon, and Italian schlock-fixture John Steiner (openly admitting most of his films are crap and he's no interest in seeing Caligula) do contribute lengthy interview featurettes, what I've heard of Helen Mirren's audio commentary is fairly good (though nothing thus far to match her onset comment that ""It has an irresistible mixture of art and genitals in it"") but Malcolm McDowell's commentary is definitely the big attraction here - at one point he even pauses mid-anecdote to compliment Teresa Ann Savoy's naked derriere!";Get the four-disc 'Imperial Edition' UK DVD if you can find it for the extras alone

Although I have taken the form of Caius Caligula, I Am all men, as I Am no man. I Am a God."" - Caligula Caesar.\n\nThose words could just have easily been spoken by Lucifer, the ultimate prideful rebel. And in effect, by proxy, they were. as the Satanic spirit is repleat throughout this figure. They were spoken by the namesake of this magnificent historical erotic docu-drama. The original intent of this production was to present the most accurate and realistic portrayal of the events under the Caligulan reign.\n\nThere is plenty of fair warning in the beginning, that the subject mater may offend and disturb, so no-one need complain about subjecting themselves to the utterly opulent decadence herein. Truly, Rome in all of its glory. Much controversy has followed this film ever since its pre-production, filmed on location in Rome, Italy. Rumors, of orgies, incest, bestiality, extreme cruelty, blood and gore, followed this film since the start - all of which is most assuredly does contain.\n\nThe DVD includes a revealing ""making of"" documentary, which proves to be of great interest with the forboding narrator, with interview inclusions of Bob Guccione {Penthouse publisher and iconoclast, whose scrumptuous 'pets' adorn the film throughout}. Sir John Gielgood {a classic actor of the first callibre}, Peter O'Toole {elite actor who plays Caesar Tiberius}, among others. Here and there, one notices some excised scenes previously unavailable in the widely released form, as it may have proved too extreme for American censors of the time, although I Am sure the European release included them in full.\n\nThe cinematography remains some of the best this writer has seen, before its time in the forthcoming Daemonocracy, as The Age of Fire enters the next phase, films rated ""X"" would be presented in the same theatres as those with an ""R"" or ""PG"" rating, with proper documentation submitted by individuals for their viewing. The sets are marvellous, displaying veritable temples of the flesh for the indulgent rewards of those who enter its chambers.\n\nKettle drums slowly pound monotonously within the echoing halls of pleasure and ecstasy, joined with a chorus of blissful moans and beautifully undulating bodies, amidst the sweet scents of exotic incenses , all under the lustful gaze of Neptune, Venus, and others gods and goddesses of the Roman pantheon. Deja-Vu, to be sure.\n\nCaesar Tiberius must choose a successor. He invites young and naive Caligula to the palace, where he is introduced to some of the elements of betrayal and deceit, and witnesses a justified evisceration as the result of one guard's improper enebriation.\n\nThe Palace is filled with beauty in both the occupants and their surroundings. Adorned in horned helmets, satyres thrust into eager nymphs who hungrily take the phallii deep into themselves, filled with pleasure. They swing around upon ornate, vine-decorated wreath-like swings, happily straddling phallic attachments in lascivious rapport.\n\nCaligula strikes a deal with his right-hand man at the time, named Magnus, a Roman soldier, to kill Tiberius and take the throne. Tiberius is subsequently strangled, and Caligula comes into possession of The Emperor's Ring, which he wields with pride and power. Caligula rises to rulership, together with his sister and lover, becoming increasingly more imbalanced, self-destructively, excessively selfish, and indiscriminate in his proclamations. One telling moment was when he spied a virginal couple attending one of his arena events - this one, a remarkable spectacle which employs an elaborate wall-like beheading apparatus, which swings its propeller-like blades along the ground, where prisoners have been buried up to their necks, then razed in decapitation. Caligula wonders if the girl is really a virgin. He commands them to come to him in his secret chambres, where he taunts the man, a soldier, by the way, and devirginizes his fianc' before his traumatized eyes. In a surprising twist, he commands the man to bend over, wherein he thrusts his fist, ring and all - into his rectum. - he no longer is a ""virgin"" either. He is later slowly stabbed to death and urinated upon in an effort to divulge the sensation of dying, as Caligula attempted to find out, with Sir John Gielgood's character earlier on, whom he drowned when he determined he was lying.\n\nIn another scene, youths masturbate into golden bowls providing a facial for a noblewoman. A veritable protein-filled youth lotion which is the progeneration of life.\n\nOne night, Caligula decides to sleep with a horse. It is rather humorous, as the next scene shows them in bed together, sans a cigarette!\n\nIn still another scene, Caligula dons the ceremonial vestments of the Priestesses of Isis, and mingles in with them in the chamber of a sacred pool, where he selects the most promiscuous woman in the kingdom to be his wife {probably as a test to see if she will remain faithful}, who subsequently births his heir, a daughter, whom he insists on calling his son {as such the importance placed on male heirs at the time}. Eventually, Caligula goes insane upon the death of his sister / lover from the fever, which is the turning point to more of his crueller exploits, including hosting an orgy which includes the Senate's {the so-called ""natural enemy of the Emperor""} wives and sons, which I believe is what eventually does him in. Also, in his terrible grief, he temporarily lowers himself to the level of the peasants, roaming incognito amongst them, becoming enraged when when he witnesses a troupe of acrobats mocking he and his wife through effigy, thus disrupting their sacrilegious display, which lands him in a filthy jail, wherein he develops a strange affinity for the common folk therein. Upon his return to The Throne, he has the acrobats arrested and executed.\n\nIn the end, the tyrannical Caligula is assassinated in Egypt by one of his own Generals, as seems to the typical modus-operandi of the Caesars.\n\nOverall, Caligula is a remarkable piece of underground paganography that has to be seen to be believed, and therefore, appreciated.";Hail Caesar!

This movie is execrable, but not deliberately so, and that is the most depressing thing of all. Someone actually thought it was good enough to warrant expending a lot of effort and money. Why else would they go to the trouble of hiring such actors as O'Toole and McDowell? I used to have some respect for Malcolm McDowell before I saw him in this crock of toxic waste. That's safely gone now, of course, but still I wonder why he accepted this role. Was he hard up for cash, or does he simply have no dignity? Or are both true? Either way, it was money ill spent. The acting is a mess, the plot is incomprehensible, the composer is a ... , whoever adapted the screenplay is an incompetent, and there are actually two directors, but all that does is give me one extra person to loathe. The fact that this movie is available on DVD is a testament to something so bad, the word to describe it has yet to be invented.\nWhy was this movie made? There are actually people who bother coming up with intellectual rationalizations for it - id est, ""Yeah, but this is the way things REALLY WERE!"" Nonsense. Softcore pornographer Tinto Brass and hardcore pornographer Bob Guccione did not come together one day and decide to direct a realistic historical epic. No, the right answer is the most obvious one and the most difficult one to face - they actually thought this horrible, horrible movie would titillate someone. Let me repeat that to let the horror sink in - they actually thought people would be titillated by a movie which contains a scene in which a man's genitals are severed and thrown to a pair of hounds (and if you think I'm making this up, I only wish I was as naive as yourself). They actually thought people would find eroticism in a movie in which there is not only none of it, but also no pleasure, no joy, in fact not a single human emotion whatsoever aside from a sort of smug self-satisfaction at one's own disgusting vileness. Not only did they fail as directors, artists and creators, but they failed as human beings. Their movie will be forever appreciated by those who are too creatively, mentally and emotionally bankrupt to find any amusement or pleasure in anything higher than smug, bloated maliciousness, but that still does not justify its having been made.\nTragically, their assumption wasn't too far off the mark. For me, the absolute worst came from having to watch this movie with other people. I'm not making any of this up: people around me actually _cheered loudly_ during the rectal fisting scene. Even wilder was their merriment during the scene in which two whores urinate on the corpse of a man who was just tortured to death (which you will also please believe that I am not making up). ""Cretinous"" is too weak a word to describe such reactions. Having to watch someone I love be genuinely entertained by this catalogue of disease was one of the most saddening and enraging events that I have ever had the misfortune of experiencing.\nI can forgive audiences who paid to see this in 1980. Back then, no one yet knew what an atrocity this movie is. But twenty-odd years have passed since then. Now no one has any shred of an excuse to see this movie. As you read this, it is entirely within your power to exercise a very small amount of effort and purchase _any_ other movie. If you pass up the chance to do this, and use your money to buy Caligula instead, I hope I never meet you.";Stay far away.

That was in the mid 1990s, when video stores still abounded and there was no way to buy ""banned"" films, and X-rated films were only available for viewing in few-and-far-between intervals.  So, it was almost 20 years before I saw it for the first time.  I knew of the orgies and so forth, and was expecting them to be quite a bit more gory than they actually were.  There's only one scene that I'd call ""really disgusting"" - and it's one of the hetero-sex scenes - and since I am gay, I suppose it's appropriate that I'd think so...some of the hetero scenes were nicely done, although they needed more homosex scenes for sure.  I read Ebert's review for it back in the 90s and it made me want to see the film even more.

It also boasts an impressive cast of stars who seem to have believed in the project by forcing themselves to pretend they were making a movie for Lindsay Anderson (O Lucky Man) or Stanley Kubrick (Clockwork Orange).  In fact, the ever-splendid Peter O'Toole gives a chilling, scary performance as Tiberius Caesar, Caligula's grandfather.  His dying emperor reminds me of Willem Dafoe's character in David Lynch's Wild at Heart, very dangerous and very insane.  Tiberius, like all the historical individuals in most films about Rome, is completely bogus here, but O'Toole falls into the spirit of the cartoony nature of this flick and has a grand old time going WAY over the top as he would love to have done in every movie he's made.  He is at his best in these kinds of roles, see The Ruling Class and The Lion in Winter.\n\nThe English are nothing if not mercenary in a very practical sense, so the producers of Caligula were able to entice the great John Gielgud to give them one of his programmed performances for a, no doubt, very high fee for 10 minutes of film time.\nAnd I expect he enjoyed all the naked people running around in his scenes on the isle of Capri.  Good work if you can get it.\n\nThe historic person, Gaius Caligula, was a huge man according to the historians, who was hairy, bald and brawny.  We have quite a different impression of this man stemming from the really off-base character in I Claudius, played by the otherwise great John Hurt, and this version here, played by a similarly wan and blonde, English, naughty choirboy type.  Malcolm MacDowell has stated that he now knew what it was like to be a whore.  Well, I expect he had a pretty good idea of that before this project, but having said that, he certainly seems to be enjoying himself enormously as this fantasy anti-hero, Caligula Caesar, who spends his days and nights fornicating with girls and fisting the boys.\n\nHelen Mirren seems game for anything and it isn't all that surprising to see her flailing her enormous breasts about in priapic rituals in old Roma.  Mirren was always a superb actress who has shown over the years how versatile and adventurous she is when choosing roles, and she does them all brilliantly.  After Caligula was made she went on, years later, to star in Peter Greenaway's shocking, often disgusting film The Cook, the thief, his wife and her lover, finally making her way to Buckingham Palace as Queen Elizabeth II.  An amazing career when you look at her curriculum vitae.\n\nThese four stars make for engaging viewing between orgies and atrocities, which are, in themselves, interesting to watch, if you have the stomach for it.\n\nCaligula is a movie for people who appreciate the beauty of the human body and are not averse to seeing it on display in a wide array of positions and activities.  The dialogue is not nauseatingly inane because Guccione opted to concentrate on the sex stuff so few words were needed to add on to Vidal's work.  What a con!  The man was a genius.\n\nThe film is made slightly cheesy, in an appropriate manner for a porn flick, by the use of 'classical' music by Aram Khachaturian and Serge Prokofiev, recorded in Mantovani-like ffffFrequency sound; lots of swooning violins in an indoor pool environment, sort of thing, alternating with blaring Ben Hur-like brass fanfares and bombast.\n\nThe sets, as I stated, are first class, no expense was spared on the production and is in many ways beautiful to behold.\nGuccione was the Preminger porn kings.\n\nYou've been warned, but for those of you still interested, get it.";The porn Gone with the Wind

This is the part where we see the real actors, like John Gielguld and Peter O'Toole.  They end up getting killed off rather early, and the rest of the film is just one lewd act after lewd act.  Lots of gore, hardcore sex, more gore, etc., etc..  Aside from the aformentioned opening 20 minutes, the rest of the film is badly acted (except for McDowell, who is good at Caligula), badly shot (the camera movements are jerky, and it is poorly lit and framed), and the dialogue is very poor.  This was based on a screenplay by Gore Vidal, but it's rather obvious that Bob Guccione spruced up the hardcore sex angle, and made himself a spokesperson for the first amendment with this film.  While the film should be available and should never be censored (bad taste and crappy filmmaking is not a reason to disregard the first amendment), it doesn't make it art just because the film ""polarises"" people and that it's controversial.  It's a real ordeal to sit through, and it's not erotic at all (porn rarely is).  It's a rather depressing experience, mainly because it's just really bad filmmaking.  I wonder what kind of film would have turned out if they had followed Gore Vidal's screenplay more closely.  If you want to check out something really good about Caligula, rent the British miniseries I, Claudius, which really goes into Caligula's madness and his rule.";If you threw this DVD into a river, it would float, because s**t floats...

Loaded with over-the-top set design and egregious nudity, Caligula is often unfairly brushed off as an expensive porn flick. In fact, what seems agregious to us now might not even be a slight exaggeration as regards the Roman Empire in the early AD's. Apparently, this film is one of the more realistic accounts of the debauchery of the time. Indeed, the marketing does not shy away from this. The tagline read something along the lines of: ""The only film to show the true side of Ancient Rome!"" If the film's content is any indication, I would think so!\n\nCaligula has 'cult' written all over it (as well as other 'c' words). This is not a great film, but it IS a great movie. Perfect to pop in in the middle of the night if you are bored, intoxicated, or both. As far as escapist fare goes, Caligula goes well. With the midnight-show dress-up aficionados, it would be just plain fun. Perhaps even a double feature with Rocky Horror?\n\nThe sets are outrageous but that's the point. Malcolm McDowell's acting job is surprisingly good, if a bit over the top (but who said that's a bad thing?). Peter O'Toole puts in a decent (albeit short-lived) performance as Tiberius.\n\nMy biggest qualm, however, with Caligula is the editing. The hardcore scenes are more than unnecessary and the fluidity of scenes and scene changes is almost incomprehensible at times. Blame Guccione for this; he locked Brass out of the editing room.\n\nOverall I could not give Caligula anything higher than 3 stars out of 5, although I sometimes wish I could. 4 stars is 'Blow-Up' and 'Dirty Harry' territory, and I would feel uncomfortable having them share the glory with such infamy.\n\n***/*****\nFun, over-the-top, visually stimulating (among other things), a good conversation piece, and a great time-capsule artifact.";Choppy editing mars a fun flick
91;39.0;3.0;17.0;-620.7920689655172;"Some describe CALIGULIA as ""the"" most controversial film of its era.  While this is debatable, it is certainly one of the most embarassing: virtually every big name associated with the film made an effort to distance themselves from it.  Author Gore Vidal actually sued (with mixed results) to have his name removed from the film, and when the stars saw the film their reactions varied from loudly voiced disgust to strategic silence.  What they wanted, of course, was for it to go away.\nFor a while it looked like it might.  CALIGULA was a major box-office and critical flop (producer Guccione had to rent theatres in order to get it screened at all), and although the film was released on VHS to the home market so many censorship issues were raised that it was re-edited, and the edited version was the only one widely available for more than a decade.  But now CALIGULIA is on DVD, available in both edited ""R"" and original ""Unrated"" versions.  And no doubt Gielgud is glad he didn't live to see it happen.\nThe only way to describe CALIGULIA is to say it is something like DEEP THROAT meets David Lynch's DUNE by way of Fellini having an off day.  Vidal's script fell into the hands of Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, who used Vidal's reputation to bankroll the project and lure the big name stars--and then threw out most of Vidal's script and brought in soft-porn director Tinto Brass.  Then, when Guccione felt Brass' work wasn't explicit enough, he and Giancarlo Lui photographed hardcore material on the sly.\nViewers watching the edited version may wonder what all the fuss is about, but those viewing the original cut will quickly realize that it leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination.  There is a tremendous amount of nudity, and that remains in the edited version, but the original comes complete with XXX scenes: there is very explicit gay, lesbian, and straight sex, kinky sex, and a grand orgy complete with dancing Roman guards thrown in for good measure.  The film is also incredibly violent and bloody, with rape, torture, and mutilation the order of the day.  In one particularly disturbing scene, a man is slowly stabbed to death, a woman urinates on his corpse, and his genitals are cut off and thrown to the dogs.\nIn the accompanying documentary, Guccione states he wanted the film to reflect the reality of pagan Rome.  If so, he missed the mark.  We know very little about Caligula--and what little we know is questionable at best.  That aside, orgies and casual sex were not a commonplace of Roman society, where adultry was an offense punishable by death.  And certainly ancient Rome NEVER looked like the strange, slightly Oriental, oddly space-age sets and costumes offered by the designers.\nOn the plus side, those sets and costumes are fantastically beautiful, and although the cinematography is commonplace it at least does them justice; the score is also very, very good.  The most successful member of the cast is Helen Mirren, who manages to engage our interests and sympathies as the Empress Caesonia; Gielgud and O'Toole also escape in reasonably good form.  The same cannot be said for McDowell, but in justice to him he doesn't have much to work with.  As for the DVD itself, the film is presented in its original ratio, but the term ""restored"" applies to previously censored scenes, not to the film itself, and the quality is so-so.  An unintentionally hilarious documentary is also included on the disk.\nMy final thoughts: the movie does possess a dark fascination, but ultimately it is an oddity, more interesting for its design and flat-out weirdness than for content.  Some of the bodies on display (including McDowell's)are extremely beautiful, and some of the sex scenes work very well as pornography... but then again, some of them are so distasteful they might drive you to abstenance, and the bloody and grotesque nature of the film undercuts its eroticism.

The earliest and best of  on-screen portrayals of Caligula were found in movies such as the Robe, Demetrius and the Gladiators(Robe 2), and A.D.(Anno Domini, Jesus of Nazareth 2), in either case, you'll find a classical(by that I mean accurate yet restricted)approach to the person of Gaius Caligula(ie, tyrant,sex maniac,self-declared god, psychopath, paranoid schizo, and once who would have hallucinations or delusions of seeing the goddess Isis or/and Diana running through his courts. However, when it comes to CALIGULA, I have to admit that after months of curiousities about purchasing the so-called ""most controversial film of the 20th century,"" I gave in just yesterday and purchased it from the local media Play, watched the movie, and my impression was as follows: the movie starts with Caligula chasing his sister around half naked in the woods and getting his freak on, declares himself a god in the opening credits(along with the flashing of a passage from the Gospel of Mark), Tiberius has orgies, Caligula dances, more orgies, Tiberius gets murdered, more orgies, more murders, more paranoia, more orgies, rape, decapitations, porstituton, Caligula's sis dies from fever, the senate gets fed up with his antics, and BAM, from out of nowhere he's assassinated and speared to pieces by Roman guards. No set, no plot, and no sense. For a better, more entertaining portrayal of Caligula, I strongly recommend the movies I'd mentioned earlier.

From the first it takes the monumental doom laden sets and the cast of loonies being 'depraved'. From the second it takes the snarling personal politics of royalty attempting to rule a worldwide empire.\n\nThe sets really are superb. Enormous attention to detail and a collection of the world's best set and costume designers make this film a work of art. The actors all put in a fine job, except that O'Toole and McDowell get to overact on more than one occasion, showing the lack of directorial control that bedevils the film.\n\nForget about historical correctness. Most evidence has been lost (true for most periods in history) and what remains is partial and biased, written by members of the senatorial class whom Caligula attacked. The film is both memorable and convincing, however, which cannot be said about many historical films.\n\nThe pornography is a sales device. That is, we are told that Guccione interpolated sex scenes after the film was finished and that this alienated the director, Tinto Brass, who removed his name from the credits. But Tinto is into pornography, and helped organise the final orgy which seems really typical of the free love 70s. The pornography is restricted to one scene, the senatorial brothel, integral to the depiction of Caligula's humiliation of the Senate. Elsewhere it is little more than nudity (and the Romans didn't wear many clothes except on formal occasions) and a couple of flashes of two actresses labia. The brothel scene did have several scenes of fellatio and one insertion, but these scenes were not emphasised; they added to the effect of the scene, and effectively so.\n\nAlthough the motives of all concerned with the film are reasonably suspect, it did succeed in depicting Roman times, Roman morality and Roman politics in a believable manner. Lack of an integrated directorial style may have caused Caligula to fall short of being a 'great' film, but it is a very interesting failure indeed.

86;46.0;3.0;14.0;-754.2278614823814;"Any book or film purporting to examine the life of the Roman Emperor Gaius (Caligula) must necessarily look deep into a tormented soul. Caligula (which means ""Little Boots,"" a nickname the future emperor picked up in the army camp of his famous father Germanicus) ruled for a mere four years, from 37 to 41 AD, but managed to alienate almost every member of the Roman government during that time. What we do know about Caligula, which is actually very little, comes from Suetonius, a historian in the employ of the Emperor Hadrian nearly 100 years after Caligula's reign. Suetonius paints a picture of an insane tyrant, a power mad figure that murdered, tortured, tormented, and flaunted his unlimited power over the Roman Empire until his brutal assassination. Unfortunately, the historian Tacitus's treatment of Caligula's reign was lost to the ages long ago, leaving us with little else to go on concerning this interesting man from eons ago.\nIn the 1970's, Bob Guccione, the publisher of Penthouse magazine, got together with writer Gore Vidal and film director Tinto Brass to create a film version of Caligula's life. This film was not going to be a whitewash, but an attempt to create a version of life in Rome true to the historical accounts, a movie unflinching in its portrayal of the violence and decadence of that ancient empire. There are various cuts of ""Caligula"" floating around in video store limbo, but the unrated version is the one you need to get in order to see all of the ubiquitous grotesqueness. An added extra on the disc, a ""making of"" documentary about the film, is immensely interesting to watch because it shows you the beginning of the controversy that eventually plagued the film. According to this behind the scenes footage, the original name of the film was ""Gore Vidal's Caligula,"" a title changed after Vidal's arguments with Brass and Guccione over some of the explicit content became irreconcilable. The interviews with the three principals reveal the beginnings of this argument. It is a nice for a film buff to see a record of this titanic clash of egos. Completely apart from the disagreements over the content of the film, this DVD extra does a great job of showing how the craftsmen made the excellent set pieces for this epic film.\nAs most people know, the film stars some of the biggest names in Hollywood, including Sir John Gielgud as Nerva, Peter O'Toole as the Emperor Tiberius, Helen Mirren (kept on a strict leash, so to speak), and Malcolm McDowell as the deranged Caligula. Almost all of the stars distanced themselves from the movie after its release, probably due to Guccione and Brass's instance on inserting decidedly indecent scenes. While none of the stars appear in these explicit inserts, the repugnance of these images would send any mainstream actor shrieking for the door. In short, the film is pornographic and therefore potentially damaging to big name thespians.\nOpinions about this movie tend to be polarized: some love the dramatic set pieces, the over the top acting by McDowell and O'Toole, and the atmosphere of a time long gone. Others see ""Caligula"" as total trash, full of bad acting, an overlong running time, and disgusting imagery. I think the response to this epic should lie somewhere in the middle, that McDowell does occasionally rise to grandeur in his depiction of this unsettled figure. At other times, his performance seems forced and grating. Witness his ""crazy"" laughter on the beach while the legions collect seashells. I laughed aloud at his pitiful attempt to portray a delusional madman in this scene. O'Toole and Gielgud do a good job with what they have to work with, and die off quickly enough to protect themselves from most of the critical backlash.\nI enjoy films about the Roman Empire, with a few notable exceptions. The lessons learned about the dangers of unlimited power concentrated in the hands of one man should continue to serve as warnings for rulers throughout the ages. If this film helps to teach that lesson, all to the better. I suspect it won't, though, because it is difficult to take ""Caligula"" seriously at times. I recommend reading Suetonius; his biographical sketches of emperors from Julius Caesar to Domitian provide a much more helpful account of power run amok than this film does. He also includes sordid details too outrageous for even this movie. Moreover, a reading of Suetonius's sketch on Caligula reveals some possible motives about why Caligula acted as he did, something the movie does not do as well. Give it a shot if you must, but be ready for gratuitous violence and highly charged eroticism. By the way, the picture quality leaves a lot to be desired. It is grainy at times and is not the best transfer job ever done for a film.";Not Bad, Not Great

78;51.0;2.0;12.0;-1065.213197519929;"Lesser ecstasy, the way of all flesh, this is Caligula. Perverse, almost religious. Pretentious production overblowing the proportions of its intent, the result could have been far more meritorious and grandiose. Gore Vidal, Bob Guccione, and Tinto Brass, gathered for the ultimate erotic film ever shown in common Theaters, the result as a cinematographic triumph, not happening, but it is still shocking. The only real statement of Caligula is to have dared shown the pre-Christian Roman Empire in its entire decadent life of rotten flesh, unlimited sex, clean, filthy, orgiastic parties of special magnificence, and cut-throat acts of bestial and deprave human willing, it is great and beautiful.\n\nCaligula stands somewhere in the dominions of the erotic and the graphic of pornography. Tinto Brass narrates the lousy story of Emperor Gaius Germanicus Caesar, better know as Caligula, a script by Oscar Winner writer Gore Vidal, whose intentions to tell the fall from sanity and common sense into the Necromancies of power and the corruption of its touch, corrupted by the crown and its seasons, where frustrated by Director Tinto Brass, this project was to much for him, lacking the necessary vision and talent for an accurate direction, the other layer of bad sense was indeed its producer, Bob Guccione, at least Guccione had the daring eye to show the explicit even more explicit, but also lacking the talent for a better understanding of the story, it was about sex for him since the beginning. About the Historic Caligula, the main ancient reference to the megalomaniac character (besides the vague anecdotal writings), is: Suet. Gaius; Dio 59; Philo In Flaccum and Legatio ad Gaium; Jos. AJ 19.1-211. Tacitus's account of the reign is lost. However, he makes occasional references to Gaius in the extant portions of his works, as does Seneca. The later sources inherited a tradition about Gaius that can be shown to be biased and exaggerated. Besides these literary sources, inscriptions and coins also offer some information. So you can't be factually loyal to the Historic truth, and that gives you license to do pretty much anything you want, in this matter, the film can't be criticized concerning the story of its protagonist. Tinto Brass direction is un-personal and cold, a succession of images that moves schematically towards a much predictable ending. The first 30 minutes are composed in an inappropriate Theater style, which is un-intentionally enhanced by the Theatrical production design of the settings, it seems that Tinto Brass caught a better sense of pace and composition after shooting those scenes, and some how manage a more dynamic narration, even so, without any real soul. Bob Guccione shoot additional material to be added in the sex scenes, but the mediocre editing felt short inserting those scenes in a more imperceptible way.\n\nOver the years I heard a lot of stories about the graphic and out daring ways of Caligula's sex scenes, so I expected to see real hard core images, stories that went from vast orgies, to a woman having sex with a horse, a man having intercourse with a duck, and a very long etc of perversities. So the movie didn't really shock me as I expected. Of course, if you are a very conservative or repressed person, the film will not only shock you, it will insult your moral values, Pastors, loyal Christians, and of course, Republicans, will also be severely insulted by the sex scenes, any way, the movie comes anticipated with an infamous fame, you can't make no mistakes, if you buy or rent it, don't blame the film for its controversial content, blame your self for being naive.\n\nCaligula's sex content is way out dare from any previous movie that calls it self an erotic film, the difference is that Caligula does have pornographic inserts on it (plain shots of both sex's genitalia, oral sex, copulations, masturbation, etc). But the film can't be categorized as a porn flick. Pornographic movies intention is to show continuous explicit sex scenes without any real plot, always pushing for as many sex scenes as possible, Caligula doesn't have this, even though the story is poor, the sex is very well inserted in the life of the Roman Empire, expanding its plot with its main characters concerning the madness and greed for power, there is not a continuous pushing for exposure of hard core sex all over the film (at least not in the way of porn flicks), here lies the charm of the film, the sex taken in the social environment of the Roman Empire is an splendid depict of the period, every shot of sex intercourse is for free, but to be honest, I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nThe performances of the Cast are both poor and flat. Malcolm McDowell wasn't enough for the role, his malignant looks felt short, an opportunity much dismissed. The Great Peter O'toole is barely O.K. but without any resembles to his masterful and classical performances. Helen Mirren and John Gielgud are completely wasted, the rest aren't really actors to be considered so.\n\nThe Woman are just beautiful, Teresa Ann Savoy (Julia Drusilla), Helen Mirren (in her younger years), as Caesonia, the Penthouse Pets are breathtaking, a real feast for the eye.\n\nThe photography is awful, boring colors and easy lighting, a mayor waste if you take into consideration the significant budget of the film. A good score does some goods for the film (including music by Sergei Prokofiev). Bad costume design and pretentious setting design surely captures the mood of the Roman Empire, but a fake Roman Empire. Caligula was released in 1980, at the very end of the 70's sex freedom, and just before Ronald Regan's repressed republican policies of censorship. Right now Caligula could not be shown in common Theaters in the U.S.A in its un-rated version. If it where a high pack action thriller full of blood, there will be no problem at all.\n\nThe DVD is O.K., the transferring can't be called bad, but a better work could have been attained, the 5.1 Dolby Digital is good, but with a poor distribution of the sounds. The Making Of Documentary is excellent and very complete (also un-rated).\n\nSo, even with all the bad elements in it, Caligula is brave and highly entertaining, and Cinema always needs brave and different projects to sustain it self. You can call it a piece of sh..., or a masterpiece, it doesn't matter, Caligula, Fellini Satyricon (oviously emulated by the producers of Caligula), and Gladiator are the only Roman films I'll see during Holy Weekend.";Mirabilis, Caelestis, et Diabolicus.

It includes a new high def transfer of the unrated, uncensored feature film and an alternate pre-release version.

59;53.0;5.0;11.0;-26.640999999999977;This incredible movie reminded me of a bad car accident I saw as a child, -horrific, shocking, fascinating. It is perverse, erotic and so incredibly haunting, that the images will stay with you long after the credits have rolled. I have a feeling that it was probably a hell of a lot worse in real life than was actually dipicted by this movie and in my opinion, it is a brilliant historical piece.\n\nThe performances of Helen Mirren, Malcom McDowell, Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud were marvellous and inspired, -they all deserved Oscar nominations in my opinion!\nUnforgettable.;Unforgettable...
117;54.0;3.0;13.0;-17.279528301886756;The most surprising thing about this movie is that with an international cast of in some cases classical actors (Gielguid, O'Toole Mirren ) it is so pornographic. If you look closely you then realise that the name actors  don't actually participate in the steamier scenes and probably were not  even there when they were shot. The surprise is to sit down expecting a Ben  Hur type movie and end up watching porn. Does this make it a bad movie?  maybe not but it does not make it a good movie either.\nThe documentary is  hilarious and worth the cost alone. 3 Stars for fascination value.;Surprise
106;55.0;1.0;12.0;-76.69029411764703;Could have been a great movie if they had gotten a decent director and had not butchered Vidale's script but still pretty good none the less. Shows ancient Rome in all its glory. Probably one of the most realistic potrayals of ancient Rome ever made. The film attains good status based only on the great performances by its principal actors. Now on to the DVD. I bought a copy of this horrible ... only because the cover said Digitally Remastered and Fully Restored. The film quality of this DVD is unbelievably bad. The whole thing is very grainy and there were even parts were I could see scratches in the film and also where it had been repaired. I have movies on VHS tape that put this DVD to shame. I can't say enough about how bad the picture and sound quality of this DVD is. Do not buy a copy of this .... Hopefully someday someone will really fully restore and remaster this film but this one aint it.;Good movie, Horrible DVD
56;56.0;5.0;10.0;-588.1641566265059;"Definitely a different type of historical drama movie, ""Caligula"" differentiates itself from other movies by holding nothing back in terms of sexuality.  Probably the only historical drama I've seen that consists of actual sex scenes with real bodily fluids and Roman-style orgies; some call it obscene, grotesque, etc, but those opinions go to show how utterly different the times of Ancient Rome were, and the film is unafraid to provide such a generous helping of sex that it is quite literally considered by many an expensive porno.\n\nThe violence is not as horrible as you might see in R-rated horror movies (or that grotesque scene in Spiderman2 with Doctor Octopus butchering the surgeons), though with much blood, and one case of castration (not real, don't worry!)\n\nThe acting is truly something else.  Malcolm McDowell puts on his best performance I've ever seen as Gaius Julius Caesar Germanicus ""Caligula"", and even succeeds in giving Caligula a human face apart from the grotesque portrayals of all the historians who chronicled him (Tacitus and Suetonius).  He truly excels in showing a Caligula who is not necessarily completely mad, but rather an average young man corrupted by extreme wealth, extreme power, and the need to shock and disturb the aristocrats he so detests.  Don't confuse this, he IS quite mad, but he is still human, and has human emotions; love, jealousy, paranoia, fear, hatred.  Peter O'Toole's role as Tiberius is short in regard to the total movie, but it is absolutely convincing, casually trying to kill Caligula while continuing about his facade of treating him as a loved one.\n\nOne of the best parts of the movie was when Caligula organized an entire Roman legion on the coast of Italy, said he was going to invade Britain, and had the legionnaires charge, naked, into the water and attack Papyrus plants.  I had a great laugh at that.\n\nNow comes the problems:  It seems to me this film has had a controversial post-production period, in which screenplay writer Gore Vidal attempted to disown the screenplay, porn director Bob Guccione added some pretty pretentious and unnecessary sex scenes which contributed nothing to the movie and brought the momentum to a stand still so we could watch some random girls have sex for some reason known only to him, and some of the scenes appear to have been cut together in the wrong places, as I've read in other reviews.\n\nPersonally, it had potential to be absolutely spectacular, with less attention focused on the few random sex scenes, and what felt like a 45 minute sequence of just watching all the men and women (Senators' wives and daughters) having sex on that Roman naval ship in the city was exhausting.  It ceases to be arousing after about five minutes of that damn orgy, and the camera keeps going on and on and on and on for what seems like half the movie (it's much shorter than 45 minutes, but it just FELT that long)\n\nI consider this a classic; one of those movies you absolutely have to see, like Midnight Cowboy, or The Manchurian Candidate, or The Name of the Rose.\n\nAlso, this is the ONLY time I have EVER even THOUGHT this, but: This movie is definitely a movie you should NEVER show to ANYONE under the age of 16.\n\nNEVER before have I ever thought about any movie.  But don't feel dishearted--it's not a trashy gore flick like a Tarantino movie or something.  Nor is it a trashy porn with a half-assed plot.  It's a good movie, which shows the full moral scape of Rome, from the debauched aristocratic high life in the Imperial palace, to the squalor on the streets, and Malcolm McDowell's performance is as memorable as his performance in A Clockwork Orange.  If only conservative america weren't so cruel, it could be a genuine classic...";Hard to watch sometimes, but you'll be proud to have seen it
115;57.0;2.0;12.0;-176.63087786259536;The film lives up to it's reputation in the graphic sex dept. (we're talking hardcore sex), but the violence, while harsh, is not half as graphic as most people would have you believe (in fact, a little less sex  and a bit more violence would have made this film more entertaining).  It  is obvious where the money was spent (lavish sets and top-notch lead  actors), but it is also obvious where the money was not spent (poor  direction and sometimes hap-hazard editing).  While the film-makers tried  to show the decadence of Rome, the film only succeeds in assaulting the  viewer with scene after scene of heterosexual, homosexual, transgender and  mutant sex (yes, mutant sex!) interspersed (all too infrequently) with  scenes of graphic violence.  Caliguala even ends up in bed w/ a horse.  There is not a whole lot of stylistic visual appeal in this film either.  Instead, the film-makers just go for shock value, heading into Fellini  territory by populating the scenes w/ non-stop nudity and mutants.  McDowell gives an excentric performance as Caligula, while O'Tool seems to  be the only one having any fun as the old emperor Tiberius.  The rest of  the cast just drifts through the film till they are killed off.  The worst  part about this film is the fact that it goes on for 156 minutes!  Not a  great film, but certainly worth seeing once so you can tell your kids that  you saw the most notorious big-screen movie release in history.  Also makes  a great collectors item, since it is now on DVD.;So this is what a $15 million porno film looks like...
119;58.0;4.0;12.0;-139.69666666666663;"Just finished watching the Unrated version of Caligula which I had only previously seen on pan and scan VHS tape, in the R rated version.\nFirst off, the unrated version contains about 20 minutes of hardcore  predominantly heterosexual material in the form of short intercuts in the  main action. This material improves the film rather alot by slowing the  pacing and (strangely) has the effect of rendering Malcom McDowell's as  Caligulas descent into suicidal craziness more understandable and amusing.  A ""descent into suicidal craziness"" *amusing* you ask? Yes.  Caligula is an intelligent and powerful film but at no point could it be  accused of taking itself seriously. This is Roman history according to  Suetonius with a very big nod to Fellini. The humour is broad, the sets are  brilliant and the point of the film is nothing short of scorching.\nThe  DVD mastering is not the best I have ever seen but is massively better than  VHS (and is in the correct aspect ratio.) The sound is more than good  enough and the extra features quite reasonably good.\nIf you like adult  entertainment, by which I mean films intended for adults as opposed to  those who like ""good guys bad guys and explosions"" this is most  definitely one to watch again and again.\nTop stuff";Some kind of great film

Financed by Penthouse (of course), ""Caligula"" manages to trot out good ""name"" actors to give a pornographic film some respectability. Too bad. The film is historically debatable on any count and no one's watching this excrement on film for history anyway. I truly believe you can pay Malcolm McDowall to do anything but Helen Mirren is totally debased here. Scatalogical in the extreme, ""Caligula"" stands as a total  embarrassment to one and all. Camera work is downright poor at times. Mcdowall hams it up unmercifully and really seems to be enjoying the hideous things he does. A total gross-out for people who like watching bloody car accidents. Help yourself.";HORRIFIC  EXCESS....
94;60.0;3.0;11.0;-18.786822429906508;You know there are problems when the director of a film removes his name.  This was an ambitious film with great sets/costumes and actors. It also has a decent story.  The problems, however, started when Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione shot additional explicit porno scenes and placed them throughout the film. These scenes total disrupt the flow of the film. Without these additional scenes, the film is already filled with plenty of sex, but it is handled very well. If you can get your hands on a version of this film without the porno, then I highly recommend it. Otherwise, you'll have to deal with it.;Good film gone bad
54;61.0;4.0;9.0;-109.27921465968582;The unrated version definitely earns an X rating, and not just for sex. I really don't like to mix sex with violence in movies because the former is the most natural thing in the world while the latter the most unnatural. Having said that, I consider this movie successful as a biopic. The excesses are intrinsic to the story, though whether they are graphic or implied is another matter. The graphic nature of the movie doesn't bother me, though some of the violence is rather gruesome (castrations, etc.). I am very glad the filmmakers decided to show the excesses graphically because it really drives home just how depraved Caligula was (or at least was purported to have been), giving the film that much more impact. However, some of the sex scenes are unnecessarily long, such as the orgy scene where fellatio is shown to the point of climax. The same effect could have been achieved with just a few seconds of the act shown rather than a few minutes. Nonetheless, if you are interested in this period of history, Caligula offers you a remarkable glimpse of the mad emperor.;Fascinating curiosity

I went to Google and entered ""Caligula"" and immediately was able to read a short one or two page bio on him. If you plan on asking your wife or girlfriend watch with you, she may appreciate the movie more rather than thinking it is just porn if you ask her to read your research too. It is VERY EXPLICIT, however it is obvious the maker of this film was trying to portray Caligula Caesar's life as historically acurate as possible. Somethings are just so graphically portrayed...";WOW!
121;63.0;4.0;11.0;-208.0165979381443;"I was fascinated by the prospect of having this film on DVD. I've seen it first time(s) on the bootleg VHS copy and was impressed by this hybrid of serious movie(Peter O'Toole, McDowell, etc)and Penthouse produce.\nNot in  form but in principle it reminds me of the late 19- early 20 century  pornography. It is known for it's exploitation of the historical settings  as an excuse for showing bare t.t and a.s. The ""live pictures""  like ""Julius Caesar stumbles upon Cleopatra making love to the common  legionaire"" were abundant.\nLater lots of American and Italian  directors made their actors impersonate Messalina and Neron having their  orgies in the papier-mache palaces in their cheap soft-porno  productions.\nWith Caligula-80 the serious step was taken in two  directions - both historical and erotic. The Roman settings became more  than an excuse and sex is much more detailed and sadistic.\nIt was an  interesting experiment. Of course we know that the Romans were very  lecherous and cruel making no difference between males and females -  anything to make their sex life more eventful.  But one thing is to  understand this on the verbal level and seeing all this in detail is  something different.\nIt's like watching the heroine dancing in a fluffy  dress through the romantic comedy and knowing she is human too and  sometimes she uses the toilet just like we all do. And then you follow her  through the toilet's door to make sure.\nSo I do not see this film as  something more than an experiment - the O'Toole and McDowell act, the  starlets display their genitals - it's an uneasy marriage, this mule of a  film is not able to have a progeny.";Do the princesses really pee?

When I finished it, I was struck by how the excellent historical narrative was bound together with explicit sex scenes, so I had to research the making of the film.  It seems the ""real actors"" who played the main roles would only do R-rated scenes, so a bunch of porn actors were hired as filler, and you can see the delination.  Sometimes you'll have McDowell, O'Toole, Mirren and the other ""serious actors"" doing an excellent scene, while in the background there is some completely unrelated and distracting hardcore sex going on.  The main storyline was broken up with sex scene interludes, and I found myself wishing they would get back to the story.\n\nMy husband is a history buff, so we just used the sex scenes to discuss the action in the rest of the film, and for him to give me history lessons on how well the story of Caligula relates to the historical record.  As it turns out, the ""serious acting"" part is a great movie, one of the best and most cinematically riveting history movies I've seen.\n\nI think anyone looking for pornography is going to be disappointed by the history part, and people wanting to see a movie about real life that is stranger than fiction are going to be disappointed that it keeps getting broken up with graphic sex scenes.  Watch this movie once to see for yourself.\n\nI liked the history part enough that we checked out the BBC series ""I, Claudius"" next, but the acting in that is wooden and very slow.  It doesn't compare to the terrific acting in Caligula.";It's really two separate movies wrapped in one
28;66.0;2.0;8.0;-390.0528991596638;"I really debated about whether to bother to write a review of ""Caligula"" or just let it sink into obvilion & hopefully out of my mind. I felt the same way about ""300,"" but like ""300"" I decided to express my thoughts for the record as it were. I usually don't read other customer reviews before I write my own, but I succombed to curiosity & did manage a little peek--then I KNEW i had to say something.\n\nThe really negative reviews seem to be from people who were disgusted by the X-rated pornography. Well, I can appreciate that view. It seems to me that the people who are REALLY INTO porn basically have unsatisfactory personal sex lives. Why else would you be drawn to something if you're already getting it on a regular basis? I think people who have a healthy sex life find porn to be inevitably boring. In the case of ""Caligula"" there is an unrelenting plethora of every kind of imaginable sex act in the book, released as a veritable non-stop action stream throughout every inch & foot of this film. So if naughty sex is what you want, that's exactly what you'll get in viewing ""Caligula."" I mean, the human body can be very beautiful,but there is such a thing as overexposure; just as the movie gets to an interesting point dramatically, group sex is thrown in once again & obliterates any real nuance of the scene.\n\nI would say that about 90% of the overall production design is a Fellini ripoff, but without that great director's humanity or humour.\n\nWhat really amazes me is all the time, talent & obulent spending that went into this picture. I agree that Malcom McDowell turns in a stellar performace as ancient Rome's worst Bad Boy. Good heavens, it's even got a young (and pretty hot cookie) Helen Mirren playing good-turned-bad-girl wife of the crazed Caesar. That's right, HELEN MIRREN! She who played Ayn Rand & Queen Elizabeth. In this movie she starts out as a priestess of Isis, then falls for Caligula, and then is literally changed like a dog to him. I know actors have always been identified with prostituion, but this is taking things a bit too far. Mirren must have tried like hell to gather up all the copies of the film she could get her hands on in order to get rid of the evidence.\n\nI gave the film 2 stars for shock value, costumes & sets.\n\nThe only thing I really can't abide about ""Caligula"" is how it slanders Pagan culture in general, and the Cult of Isis in particular--but then I don't think anyone involved took this project too seriously.\n\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Claudius/dp/B00004U12X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I, Claudius</a>";The Sex  Gets Tedious

However, there are still plenty of obvious editing issues and overall it seems that due to rewrites and some other production issues, even this version is lacking. it's primary difference is that it drops the Bob Guccione ""penthouse"" sequences that feature the most explicit sexual scenes.

This movie was no holds barred incest, rape, homesexuality, Lesbianism, torture, non-stop orgies, fellatio and degrading human beings.

And they were not to be disappointed. Stage and cinema royalty including Sir Peter O'Toole, Sir John Gielgud and Dame Helen Mirren (only Gielgud was knighted at the time) joined Malcolm McDowell and a collection of Italian and European actors in an orgy of violence and sex which included graphic XXX pornography taken directly from the pages of Seutonius' chapter on Caligula in the second century book The Twelve Caesars.\n\nThis marvellous 3 disc DVD set contains fascinating documentaries featuring extensive interviews with producer Bob Guccione and writer Gore Vidal shot at the time of production.  The full uncut 156 minute version features on the first disc. The second disc has a  shorter version which has wonderful commentary tracks by Mirren and McDowell. Alas, the 200 plus minute Guccione edited version, which was rumoured to have been shown to preview audiences in Italy, is not included in this set and in fact may no longer exist.\n\nIt is now well known that the film that Vidal wrote and Director Tinto Brass shot are not what was finally released after Guccione took control of the editing and shut Brass out of the production. To bridge huge continuity gaps Guccione and his editors extensively used out-takes and rehearsal footage rescued from rubbish bins. The documentary material provides fascinating information about what might have been a masterpiece had Brass been allowed to edit the film he shot and do pick up shots, retakes and the shooting of much needed new scenes which would become self evident in the editing stage.\n\nThanks to the documentary material, we get to fully appreciate the incredible production design, the magnitude and details of the various sets and the beautiful costumes made by Production Designer Danilo Donati and his team. This is not always evident in the finished film.\n\nThere is a wonderful interview with the very erudite John Steiner, a British actor who built a short but spectacular career in Italian exploitation films in the 1970s. Steiner shaved his head to play the slimey Longinus character. Now a real estate agent in England, Steiner's witty comments about the making of the film are worth the price of the DVD set alone.\n\nAs time goes by Caligula will continue to be restudied and reassessed. No doubt it will gain in stature but unlike the other Caligula film of cinema legend, the `lost' 1937 I Claudius featuring Charles Laughton as Claudius and Emlyn Williams as Caligula, we have ample material to study and assess thanks to this excellent DVD collection.;Caligula reassessed

The movie, I dare say, is somewhat linear in a bad way. By that I mean, there is no crescendo. No high before the fall. It's just sick humor followed by grotesque deaths, surrounded by sex. In a nutshell, the plot is about this ordinary guy, loosely related to royalty, that suddenly becomes ruler of the known world. Caius Caligula, the adopted son of the Emperor Tiberius Ceaser, fearing he is to be killed by the man who killed his family, strikes first and becomes the new Ceaser in one swift stroke. Young and cocky, he plays with his new power by first taunting, later humulating the Senate and the army in a series of ludricous acts. When his sister Drusilla, the only voice of reason he is willing to listen to dies, he really cuts loose. Seen as having gone mad, Caligula, his wife and child are inevitably killed by roman soldiers in a conspiracy lead by the Senate.\n\nThe Imprial Edition is a 3 DVD set that offers two versions of the movie, the normal comercial release and another that would have a corrected editing (text inside comments that the original movie was edited out of what should have been the correct order). There's little difference between the two. There is also an assortment of extra material, including various outtakes, picture galleries and some very intresting interviews both filmed at the time of shooting the movie and recent.\n\nMy thoughts regarding the movie is that it fails in it's attempt to portray pagen Rome as it states. I have no problems with the sex and orgies. Sex is part of what we are as people. Part of our way of life, like eating or defecating. Such hang-ups do not distract me. But filming people working naked, mallot in hand breaking rocks is not reality. It's just for show (or shock). This is not real life, simply put. Watching Bob Guccione stating in interview that the main concern was accuracy in portraying paegan Rome is a joke.\n\nIt could be suggested, that the movie would probably be less controversal, less sex-explicit and more directed to the story, if Guccione was not involved. Having said that, the movie would certainly not have the sets and costumes, let alone the great actors, without Guccione's financial involvment either. One can only wonder how the real movie, as conceived by either the screenwriter or director could have been. The finished product is neither.\n\nIt is probably clear to you by now that this is not a movie directed towards family entertainment. Though I wouldn't call it porn (it fails on that too), it most certainly is adult entertainment, much in the same way as Emmanuele or Story of O.\n\nI would suggest this movie for students of the art of film making. The sets and costumes are gorgeous and very well put together. The filming itself is very well done (choise of angles/camera positioning, lighting, contrasts). Some may find that the image and sound may not be top for today's standards but they are very good just the same. And the main reason why a movie that fails on so many levels is still topic of discussion in a serious way. This movie contains excelent acting!\n\nMalcolm McDowell is brilhant! He is completly convincing and has my utmost admiration for pulling off a very difficult acting part that done wrong, would make the movie fall flat on it's face. He is the main reason why Caligula isn't just a bad porn flick. Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud are as good as you would expect them to be, though they take part only of the first third of the movie. Helen Mirren, so young and so sexy is a treat. She, along with John Steiner who plays Longinus, help Malcom carry the movie the rest of the way. And then there is Teresa Ann Savoy. When she is on the screen, it's hard to notice anything else. She may not be a great actress, but she is convincing enough. And she is just soooo beautiful in this picture!!! A first class boner with a face of an angel and a figure of a Goddess. Pity there is no interview with her included. I hear she is happily married and a mom nowadays. Good for her.\n\nTo be truely complete, this so called Imperial Edition should have included Gore Vidal's original screenplay and Tinto Brass' italian edition of the movie (that's right, there's still another version out there hidden somewhere in Italy), which is said to be considerably different from the one that was screened in theatres around the world. I know I for one would be curious to see this Italian version.;Q: Does Power Corrupt? A: Duh!!!

I think that it requires a second viewing to adjust to the naked brutality which is present in almost the entire film, but it will be worth it.\n\nOn second viewing, I found it to be a very realistic approach to potraying Ceasar-Era Rome.  It wasn't civilized; it wasn't Athens.  It was Rome, filled with political intrigue, deceit and Emperors with near dictatorial power.  I've read Suetonius' The Twelve Caesars, and the potrayals of both Tiberius and Gaius Caligula are accurate.  Tiberius did keep a harem of young boys and girls to indulge his perverse sexual fantasies, he did have a building full of copulating couples, this was all accurate in the film, and I think the gritty way it was made in the film is correct; you are meant to be shocked and perhaps outraged at his behavior.\n\nThe same goes for the Title character, Caligula.  If Tiberius was bad, Caligula was worse.  From killing Tiberius to violating bride and groom at a wedding to having people killed at his whim, he was certainly outrageous.  His over-the-top performance in this film was truly...fun...to watch, and the same goes with the rest of the cast, the acting is simply superb.\n\nOne gripe is that the sex scenes added post-production by the new financier, Bob Guccione, are gratuitous and seem slightly out of place. Overall though, the movie is a enjoyable romp through the seedy underbelly of the live of Rome's most infamous Caesar.";Pretty good. Generally, historically accurate.

Ah,how the passage of time can make us see things in a different light. This movie is mostly pretty disgusting. Some scenes had me reaching for the remote. There is little of history and much sensationalism here. Malcolm McDowell does his very naughty boy act to a tee. Not much can be said for John Gielgud and Helen Mirren who made bad career decisions by agreeing to be in this sordid little lot. My advice to the potential viewer: get hold of a book about Caligula and find out what really happened. If you must watch the movie,don't do it before or after meals.";the raunchy romans

Caligula's story is just a backdrop for the most elaborate porn film ever made.  It's extremely graphic, in sex and violence, but not as gory as I expected. (""Gladiator"" is far bloodier.) As a history lesson, I'd give it a C. We don't learn much about why Caligula turned out the way he did, just that he was indeed monstrous. The incestuous relationship between Caligula and his sister Drusilla takes center stage, while various episodes of Caligula's bizarre behavior round out the drama.\n\nThe plot isn't particularly compelling, but the acting is fine.  Malcomlm McDowell is sufficiently depraved and creepy, and Peter O'Toole is his usual commanding self.  The film is sumptuous to look at, and the essence of ancient Rome is captured nicely, palaces, togas, orgies and all.  Clearly, the filmakers took great pains (and pleasure) in bringing the sexual depravity to life - in vivid detail.  Lingering close-ups of the male and female anatomy abound. This film is not for the prudish or faint of heart, but if you want to descend into decadence for a couple of hours, you could do worse than ""Caligula.""";Elaborate Porn

Controversial it is.  Good it is not.\nI've heard through the years that Sir John Gilgud did not know that the part he was playing would be in a film showing explicit sexual acts and degredation.  I find this hard to believe, given the producer of the film - it was Penthouse magazine.\nThat said, Caligula is dull, dull, dull.  It is only the scenes of horror and sexual predation that make this film rise above the sublimely mind numbing - and that's really sad.\nYou know you're going to watch it, because you're curious, but just know this: after you watch this repugnant film, if you're anything like me, you'll want to bathe afterward.  It's really a creepy gross film.;Controversial, Purile, Revolting - and boring......
88;80.0;2.0;8.0;-326.23913461538456;This film is a great example of Malcom McDowell's finest acting. Even Helen Mirram does quite well (if not up to par with her later roles)....however, the script is just terrible, the supporting cast is horrible, and the plot is just ridiculous. I give props to Guccione, Brass, and etc. for realistically visualizing Rome at the time of Caligula, and for the truly outrageous and elaborate sets, but everything else just doesn't cut it.\n  As a porno, this movie is just dandy. There is a 10 minute lesbian scene, and a roughly 10-15 scene that features an orgy. This is only about a total of 30 minutes of hard-core material, and for a movie that goes on for nearly 3 hours....well, what can I say? I didn't watch the movie solely for the adult material (I did find out about the film from Penthouse magazine, so I knew what to expect, though!): Malcom MacDowell, Peter O'Toole....people like that just elevate the films that they appear in, and this is the case. In THIS case, an abyssmal flick is raised to the status of tolerable flick.\n  As far as extras go, i'll give the film an extra star. A lengthy 'behind the scenes' featurette from the late 70's is informative and fascinating, particularly for giving the viewer an oppurtunity to see what went behind the construction of the massive, multi-million dollar sets. It also offers a rare oppurtunity to see Bob Guccoine in person, speaking about the film (even if he is garbed in chains and a leisure suit!). The actors' perspectives are also great. Beyond this, not much else....you can listen to the soundtrack without the speech, and it is truly a massive and powerful score to the film, nearly on par with the 40's-50's epics. A commentary track with either Guccione or McDowell would be great, but I suppose that perhaps the latter may have dis-associated himself with this picture over the years?\n  Watch it for the quality acting. Watch it for the `adult' material. By no means should you watch it for the gratuitous violence (it's just horrible to look at, and i've seen plenty a gruesome movie....seeing a man gutted isn't my idea of entertainment), grainy film transfer and appaling screen play. I hope to see Mr. McDowell one day star in a big-budget film of his own...it's been much too long.;Good Porn, Bad Movie
19;81.0;3.0;6.0;-835.3260845383759;"In some ways, this film is a unique cultural product, that demonstrates the tension between historic fact and imaginative embellishment; between the craft of fine acting and pornography; and between the contrasting philosophies of the artists responsible for this collage of intentions. This review will look at all three of these contrasts.\n\nMany of the events in this film come down to us as part of the historic record. The rise and fall of these characters was documented by historians of the time and in following generations. However, in this production the events are embellished to the extreme so that the film becomes nightmarish or surreal. The costumes are akin to the flimsy costumes worn by strippers. The lives of Tiberius and Caligula and Claudius offer incredible drama and decadence as related in Suetonius' Live of the Caesars and in Robert Graves' I, Claudius.  Yet we know enough of Roman culture and daily life to understand that these characters were aberrations and products of madness and absolute power. The average Roman did not act this way and were scandalized by the behaviors of Tiberius and Caligula.  The beautiful young lovers, Livia and Proculus, exemplify this in the film. The terrible deeds that are inflicted on this handsome and innocent couple are a critical aspect of the film for they demonstrate the violation of commonly-held moral behaviors by those in absolute power who also are mentally deranged. This is a critical point in understanding this film. The absolute power of the Julio-Claudians family, of which Tiberius and Caligula were emperors 3 and 4, surrounds itself with immoral fortune seekers and parasites, that reflect back to the source of power a sense that their cruelty is indeed just fun and games, that their abuse of power is justified because of the baseness of human nature and that the people they rule are scum.  An important scene in the film depicts Caligula forcing the entire Senate to make sheep sounds while he gleefully laughs at the ability of his absolute power to create absurd behaviors in others.\n\nThe second theme that any reviewer must address is the contrast between actors with top tier reputations combining their art with that of pornographers. John Gielgud, Peter O'Toole, and Helen Mirren are highly respected and are the three strongest actors in this production. It is actually hard to judge the acting of Malcolm McDowell as Caligula since the character is so wildly overstated and dominant. McDowell plays Caligula as highly intelligent, highly indulged, and sadistically deranged. Again we are less concerned with his violent outbursts against the self serving court favorites as we are about his treatment of the lovers, Livia and Proculus, the moral center of the production. As an example, handsome and ruthless and cunning Macro is outsmarted by Caligula and comes to a terrible end, but the viewer could care less because we have learned that Macro is corrupted and power seeking. However the violation of Livia and Proculus on their wedding night and then the subsequent violence against Proculus is horrifying. As they torture Proculus he screams asking why such pain is being inflicted on him since he is a loyal lower rank military officer. Caligula answers that it is because he is not guilty that he is guilty. It is because he is not corrupt that he must be destroyed. Absolute power in combination with sadism is the recipe for human evil. But beyond Caligula, we must remember that power over others in combination with inability to experience empathy with the other is one strong source of the evil we may all experience in everyday life.\n\nThis last point brings up the contrasting and conflicting visions of Gore Vidal and Bob Guccione, the owner of Penthouse and the producer of the film.  If you are familiar with the excellent novels and essays of Gore Vidal, you soon learn of his contention that when Republics become Empires they lose their moral footing and begin to inflict cruelty and oppression against those they conquer and begin to stimulate decadence in the lives of the privileged individuals who have risen in the social class structure of the Empire.  Thus the decadence of Tiberius and Caligula and the suicide of Nerva all help convey his message that Empire and power corrupts.  But Bob Guccione has a philosophy against censorship and sexual oppression, and therefore he inserted many pornographic sequences into the film in the final edits, as if to thumb his nose at the moral sensibilities of those that run our current Empire. At first glance it would appear to be that Vidal and Guccione would be allies in their assault against the Empire. Vidal would accost the Empire for turning from its Republican roots and suppressing other nations for the aggrandizement of the Empire. Guccione would accost the Empire for sexual hypocrisy and lack of sexual freedoms. However it is the manner in which they accost the Empire that differs, and style and taste matter. For Vidal wishes us to draw upon our intellectual history and challenge the Empire on historic and rational grounds founded in the Enlightenment whereas Guccione wishes to challenge the Empire with sexual truths that often stay inside the bedroom but become unnerving when viewed in the light of day or on the motion picture screen.\n\nThis film is definitely a unique viewing experience.";An odd mixture of artistry and pornography
57;82.0;4.0;7.0;-16.203695652173877;Even though the plot of CALIGULA rates a standard B-, the real feast lies in the art direction and historical back drop.  Rome displayed deplorable morals compared to today.  Lots of nakedness.  Lots of lewd sex and promiscuity.  Incest and homosexuality. Pedaphilia and insanity.\n\nThis represents the first, and only movie, that I believe uses hardcore/X-rated sexual images as mechanisms to propel the story. When viewing them, you will shake your head in disgust and fascination...\n\n..but that represents the appropriate way to view Rome: brilliant, but immoral.;A Glimpse of Rome's Perverse Ways Indeed
58;83.0;4.0;7.0;-643.0094405594405;If this movie offends and shocks you, it's supposed to. This is not a Walt Disney feel good flick, its a flick about a dark side of human nature told in a realistic fashion. It is not possible to give an accurate view of Caligula and his times, without showing graphic, violent, and explicit material. Caligula was a man out to offend the conservative Rome of his great-grandfather Augustus at best, and completely ridicule and torture and kill at his worst. Ultimately, the Romans did kill him for it.\n\nThe movie did an excellent job in a historical context. It was very well researched, and gives a highly useful perspective on this part of Roman society at the time. The primary cast was outstanding and developed their characters exceedingly well. I do disagree with the intimacy of the relationship of Caligula with his sister Drusilla(I think that was something he did for shock value to irritate his grandmother Antonia), but by and large, I think everyone behaved quite on par with the values and context of the time. Better than Gladiator in many ways, which also did an excellent job in a historical(fiction) context.\n\nThe costuming and scenery was somewhat garish, but often very realistic. We must remember that the Romans were very concerned with fertility, as underpopulation was a real danger. Genetalia was reflected everywhere, and Priapus was quite an important God. This was a society that was so pragmatic it had a shrine next to a latrine door in Pompeii with Fortuna blessing a man defecating. So again, one must expect things to not be entirely to our flavour if its going to give some sense of truth. Yes, the wigs were something wild based on later Flavian hairstyles, and the Preatorian stuff a bit chinsey, but certainly no worse than many other Hollywood on the Tiber flicks. Same with the film and soundtrack.\n\nWhere this movie fell down, like so many others, is when the use of explicitness, or violence, etc, gets in the way of the storyline. Too many times penthouse was allowed to get in the way with pointless sex. The violation at the wedding of Proculus and Livia, and the public birthing of Julia Drusilla (poor Caesonia)would be right on par with what Caligula would do, and causes the disgust it should. The scene that has the Caligula, Drusilla, Caesonia threesome is too long, and the simultaneous back room female duo is absolutely a waste of footage. Some of the activites in the brothel scene really just end in breaking up what was an outstanding moment for understanding the sense of ridiculous, and intersting character development between major characters. Ditto on some of Tiberius' love harem. Really, it is what kept this movie from being a five star. With such a stellar cast and good story, they could have flushed out the character dynamics more, such as Caligula's pride in his daughter, and the restraining influence of Caesonia, and her own far more gracious  hence tragic death. ( I mean really, do you think the woman had a whole lot of choice?)\n\nWhat always amazes me is that people would find this movie so offensive, and punish it accordingly, yet offer academy awards to Schindler's List and Dances with Wolves-very offensive to me. Both of those films suffer from similar problems in unecesarry/overworked violence or graphic displays, and don't even have the acting quality to back it up. If the scores and film quality were better, they should have been, having been filmed later. They were 3 stars at best.\n\nOver all, a bit unfortunate. I honestly believe the movie had all the makings of a five star great. I still enjoy it, I just fast fowrd through the annoying useless bits. Those who condemn the movie based on explicit content need to stick to Disney or half truths.  Those who are interested in looking at some darker parts in human history, give it a couple of viewings, becuase there is a lot of subtle interplay going on, and you might miss it thanks to unwanted distractions.\n\nThe uncut version in any case is ABSOLUTELY for adults. The cut vesion should be fine for educated teens.;So easily could have been five stars!

25;88.0;5.0;6.0;-345.30999999999995;"I first should disclose that I have a strong respect for Tinto Brass and Malcolm McDowell.  Brass has directed a significant number of beautiful and playful Euro-teaser films which are very fun and light, and which are educational to us stodgy Americans who sometimes need some guidance in the art of loosening up.  I have seen most of his movies and have loved them.  Meanwhile, McDowell is a certified genius. Clockwork Orange proved that, and this movie furthers that impression. He possesses a strange and strong mettle, and with those piercing cold blue eyes he is the demon-freak to which other actors can only aspire.  Add to this mix: Gore Vidal, who is really not my cup of tea for a couple of reasons, but who is admittedly a high-order intellect; Peter O'Toole, in fine form here; and Bob Guccione, who had, in his prime, fabulous sensibilities as to what is sexy in a woman.  Finally, add in Caligula himself. You now have the synergistic recipe for a cinematic masterpiece which will endure for generations. Endure? No, actually it will appreciate, it will increase in value over the years. Bold, unprecedented works enjoy that reward from time.\n\nThat is exactly what these gentlemen built here.  This movie is so shock-rich and taboo-dense that I think it takes considerable time to assimilate it. It needs time to ferment in your psyche.

This time around (last night) I was instead stupefied by all the dream-like beautiful sets, the dynamic performance by Mr. McDowell  (seriously: this guy deserved an Academy Award here), all the scrumptuous females, the haunting music, Tinto Brass's elegant photography.....and much, much more.\n\nYes, this movie is clearly not for persons under 18, (or preferably under 21 in my opinion), or for people with prudish predilections.

The depictions of cruelty are not pretty, but they only highlight the arrays of lavish beauty by way of contrast.  This movie is Kubrickian in scope and haunting mood. I loved it.  Let's not make it more complicated than it really is: It is a Celluloid Masterpiece, with some parts which are hard to watch.

This is NOT for everyone to see - especially children and even adults who may be offended by this REAL historical persons existence. This movie is Malcolm McDowell. He shines in this feature from beginning to bloody end. The film came out in 1979 to very mixed reviews. The original release was later cut to achieve a strong ""R"" and most of the sequences that were cut were shelved and now released in their entirety. It was originally an ""X"" - for graphic violence and free sex - not pornography.\nDirected by the Italian director - screen named Tinto Brass, the film takes you on a journey through the life of a very sick man. The film has quite a cast starting off with Malcolm McDowell in the lead role. In this production you can find the masterful talents of Peter O'Toole, Helen Mirren and John Geilgood.\nThe production value is very high and the costumes and set design are extraordinaire. TO think a man like this existed is sick. The film is not for the week stomach.\nI liked this film for the performances and the production design overall, but the story is amazing and the details very clear. This is one you might want to rent before you buy. I bought it because I love the film moir. (8-27-02)";Interesting, Rivoting and Dynamic!

There is much more to this DVD than was available to the general public in the theater at that time.  It is much longer now.  There is wall to wall skin and panoramic sexual-depravity in the background.  It has some historical significance in that it attempts to cover the three years of Roman Emperor Caligula's rule.  The story of Caligula is the artistic excuse for the content of the film.  It is not the sort of thing you would see in an XXX-rated feature from the porno-industry because everything slides by pretty quick in the background behind the drama of the power-struggle as it unfolds.  One should not think, however, that one could just skip over the raunchy parts.  If you do not want your sensibilities to be challenged, don't load it into your machine.  Otherwise it is excellent !  It is a story of murder, incest, infidelity, loyalty and betrayal and then it starts all over again.  Around and around it goes until everybody has had more than enough.  It ends much the same way that it started.  Choose your friends carefully.  Forget the popcorn.;Classic Sexual Depravity

103;98.0;4.0;7.0;-176.63087786259536;This is one of the last x-rated movie that played on the public theaters. However, the movie is based on the real roman emperor who was finally assasinated by his military guards.\nYou must understand some stories in the movie are mainly fictional but it is highly praised the settings and clothes are similar to those of the ancient Rome.\nThe main story just shows how the clever, highly popular and young emperor becomes brutal and cruel monster. At last he met the tragic death. In the movie, it's because of the death of his only one true lover, his younger sister. In fact, some historians believe that the brother and sister had some kind of sexual relationships.\nI think this movie makes you know about historical background of the ancient Rome. So, I must say if you want to understand the movie, you should read some history books about the early days of the Roman Empire. The family tree of the Roman Emperor is very complicated.\nBut you should not expect too much from this movie. Because it is made as a pornography and some actors act so terrible.\nIn addition, the most historical happening during regime of emperor Caligula is the killing of his mother. History says he is the one who ordered to do that. But it's not mentioned in the movie.\nFor more, he is an adopted grandson of the great emperor Augustus. His father was famous Roman governor general who almost conquered the Germany but died too easily when he fell down from his horse.;Caligula
104;99.0;3.0;7.0;-407.55437100213214;"Screenplay butcherings and unnecessary sex aside, this movie proves entertaining for those who find the enormously morbid amusing. While a man's rise to and corruption by absolute power is an old idea, both historically and artistically, ""Caligula's"" chronicling of one of the older and more well-known cases is rather fascinating, if only for the freakishness and outlandishly atrociousness of it. Having not read Vidal's original screenplay, I can only hope that it contained more than merely a generous helping of Suetonius' tabloid-style biography of the man backed by excessively provacative scenes of cruelty and public humiliation and death. Still, if you find the hyper-disturbing appealing (which I do, though not enough to watch this over and over), you may enjoy this.\nOf course, there are the porno scenes, which add little, if anything, to story; for instance, the lesbian scene in Scene 19 of the DVD is completely unnecessary, while the portion involving Caligula's ""Imperial Bordello"" goes on far too long. Only one, I found, could not be almost completely skipped over: that of Tiberius' (Peter O'Toole) orgy room, which interlaces images too frantically with Tiberius' character development to miss entirely,though I do consent that his character--a mad, perverted tyrant--is quickly established. If unnecessary sex scenes--almost certainly tacked on by Guccione when Brass and the cast weren't looking; it's right there in the credits: ""additionally footage directed by Bob Guccione...edited by Penthouse Productions""--do not appeal to you (though that may be your intention: purchasing porn cleverly disguised as sensational biopic), then you probably will want to rent or purchase the R-rated version.\nA word on the quality: horrible. The footage is grainy, some lines are out of synch with lips, and I know I saw a hair in the film towards the end (on a DVD!). Still, the movie is watchable (in terms of visibility, anyway), although I felt the porn scenes had been touched up noticeably more than any others.\nActing, now. The performances by the principle actors (McDowell, van Savoy, and Mirren) make up for a piecemeal story of increasing morbidity. As said before, most of ""Caligula"" seems drawn more out of Suetonius' shock-value history than any screenplay, but this is rendered almost unnoticable by McDowell's laudable, nearly over-the top performance as the sociopathic mad dictator, which perhaps matches nicely the original ambition of the project, if not the outcome. At times (read, ""frequently""), however, that performance comes dangerously close to McDowell's character Alex DeLarge in ""A Clockwork Orange"" (another, better bit of disturbing cinema, though not as grotesque).\nFinal review: Quality of film--weird and overly ambitious. Porn scenes--annoying, and mostly unnecessary. DVD quality--[not-good]. Acting--great, drawing attention away from a fragmented plot. Ultimately, if the truly disturbing is your thing: enjoy! Otherwise: STAY AWAY.";Bizarre, disturbing, and extravagant
63;100.0;5.0;6.0;-263.0269911504424;"Our parameters to define ""crime"" differ completely from its meaning 2 thousand years ago. Caligula and Nero, 2 emperors branded as ""criminals"" by the Christianity, could have been in reality an average product of these violent times.\nRemember, the average Romans used to pay for the privilege of citizenship with half of their lives serving in the army and certainly dying in the war. And Rome was in war almost continuously for hundreds of years. I would indeed be surprised if all this would have not had any effect in the emperor's behavior. After all, life and death were nothing under the rule of Rome as well as another civilizations. Somehow life worth nothing even in our time of wars for resources, and I don't know if we, humankind, have learned anything from history.\nWar and slaughter are truly [...] and I doubt that sex is. Remember that soldier and [...] are the most ancient professions.\nBut coming back to this movie, I believe that most of the events shown here are true indeed. Sex, death, torture, etc were a normal currency in the Roman court as gladiator fighting and death was normal in the Coliseum's arena. Caligula added his personal ""touch"" to these events: the ""head harvester"" is so original and funny, gee, why didn't I think of this brilliant idea before? Did Mr. Guillotin invented his device based in the harvester? I think Caligula was both mad and smart despite other opinions in contrary. Naming his horse Senator! What a brilliant way to commit his crimes unquestioned by lousy senators. I have reasons to believe that the sex and brutalities portrayed by Tinto Brass were real. And the musical score by Prokopieff reinforced the idea that Caligula's mind was indeed both smart and sick, as it was the society that he ruled.\nI recommend this controversial film to everyone over 18 and with an enough open mind to make an objective evaluation about the terrible events that may have occurred thousands of years ago.";Was this guy mad?

Since I am used to hard core, I didn't flinch during most of the sex scenes.\n\nHowever, I was not happy with on major historical inaccuracy of the flick.  Claudius, the successor to Caligual was portrayed and a slobbering idiot with an almost mentally retarded character.  This was a tremendous injustice.  Claudius was, according to the historians, a very timid soul with a severe speech impediment.  He was embarassed to speak in public and held most of his council with (I think) one of his female cousins).  Ironically, Claudius was quite intelligent and, over the period of his reign, turned out to be one of the most effective of the Caesars.  Two of his most deirable traits were an incorruptable nature, a sense of fairness and beneath it all, a kind and generous disposition.  It might be challenged as a historical fact, but I think he suffered from epilepsy.\n\nIf you are interested in an accurate portrayal of Claudius, check out the PBS/BBC series ""I Claudius"" which aired many years ago.  I think it's available on Netflix, and, used to be listed in the Acorn catalog.  There are several hours of programming, and sometimes it drags.  If my memory serves me correctly, Patrick Stewart played the commander of the Guards and did (as usual) a fantastic job of acting.";One Major Inaccuracy

There are a lot of sex acts but I wouldn't call it a porn movie. Yes, if naked bodies shock you, don't try to watch it. But it's not about sex. There is a much bigger message.\n\nThe Roman life 2000 years ago in many aspects was very similar to our life now. And sometimes we think we can understand those people. But then some striking differences pop up. And it's quite an experience to try to compare life then and now. What is similar and what is different? Are the people the same as they used to be?

In the version I saw years ago, there was lots of nudity and a few brief shots of fellatio.  This version has long, drawn-out scenes of pure pornography.  It's not that I mind the sex; Taken on their own, the sex scenes are all beautifully done and, for the most part, fairly erotic (for this kind of thing.)  It's just that none of these scenes are integrated into the rest of the film.  They all come across as utterly gratuitous and ultimately, silly.  Now, if they had just gotten Helen Mirren to disrobe, that would have been a whole other story.\nThe best part of the movie, in my opinion, is the set design.  There are some elaborate set pieces that are simply outrageous - the moving wall of rotating blades is a sight to behold, as is the giant mock-boat contructed to house Caligula's government brothel.\nThe next best part of this movie is scratching your head in wonder at its cast.

A pity, then, that the film is such a chore to sit through even once. Despite its clear aim to shock and offend, CALIGULA manages only to be an interminable bore.  It is, in a way, the Andrew ""Dice"" Clay of films.\n\nHelen Mirren (one of several what-the-hell-are-YOU-doing-here members of the cast) once commented on the film's ""irresistible mixture of art and genitals.""  The genitals are there, all right, but there is very little art on display, save perhaps a few nicely designed sets.  As for irresistible... The acting ranges from passable to atrocious, the script has no idea where it is going or what it is trying to say, and virtually nothing in the film has any dramatic impact whatsoever. It is impossible, furthermore, to give a damn about any of the characters, apart from Caligula's sister, Drusilla. In this role, Teresa Ann Savoy actually acquits herself fairly well, and manages to escape with more of her dignity intact than anyone else in the cast.\n\nMaybe these aspects of the film are not what interests you.  Know, then, that even as a ""guilty pleasure,"" the film is astonishingly unentertaining.  In their quest for notoriety, the filmmakers have crammed nearly every frame full of depravity of one sort or another.  It is difficult to imagine a non-porn film with more nudity and sex in it, but nearly all of this footage is unpleasant.  Apart from the ""not-bad hardcore footage"" to which Leonard Maltin refers, there's nothing even remotely titillating, let alone erotic, in the entire film.  As for the notorious graphic violence, this has not aged well.  It's still unpleasant enough, but rather than shock, it tends simply to embarrass.  And then, just when you think the film has hit rock bottom, Malcom McDowell crams his fist up somebody's (butt)...  Waiter? Check please.\n\nThe DVD features the sorriest excuse for a 'restored version' I have ever seen.  The image is grainy and occasionally ill-focused, and the sound ranges from good to lousy.  The one bright spot (and, really, the only reason to check out this DVD at all) is a perversely fascinating documentary entitled THE MAKING OF ""GORE VIDAL'S CALIGULA"".  This hour-long, poorly-filmed feature gives ample insight into the laughable pretensions of Guccione et al., and includes most of the film's naughtiest bits besides (God only knows what audience it was intended for).\n\nCALIGULA is a failure on every level.  See it if you must, but don't say I didn't warn you. If you want porn, get porn; if you want graphic violence, get ROBOCOP. If you want a hammy historical epic, get CLEOPATRA; if you want a good one - well, I'm afraid I can't really help you there.

65;116.0;1.0;5.0;-350.4747806004618;Maybe in your dreams, Gore Vidal. Most of our dreams, even the ones with the endless tunnels and the abrupt falls off high cliffs, are quite a bit more coherent than CALIGULA.  The title of this review is a direct quote lifted off the hour long `making of' special bundled with this uncut version of the controversial 1979 release.  Now, to qualify everything I've said so far - quoting Vidal is a little unfair.  During the special Penthouse publisher and at least one-time movie producer Bob Guccione always refers to the movie as GORE VIDAL'S CALIGULA.  Whatever sweet spring of good feelings the principals enjoyed during the making-of special had apparently soured by the time the movie was released.  Vidal disowned the film prior to release and his credit is the rather clumsy `Adapted from an original screenplay by....'  And `uncut version' is usually called `director's cut,' but here there's no director.  The special identifies someone named Tinto Brass as the director, someone the overhead narrator approvingly characterizes as `sex obsessed.'  By the time the film was released, Brass was no longer director and his screen credit was the meager `Principle photography by.'  As far as I can tell Brass was a soft-porn sleaze-meister of minor accomplishments, his major achievement prior to CALIGULA being something called `Salon Kitty,' a 1976 sexploitation flick about a brothel keeper in Germany during World War II.\n\n  CALIGULA does have its share of heavy hitters.  Malcolm McDowell plays the title character, Peter O'Toole is the disease ridden Tiberius and John Gielgud plays the moral Roman senator Nerva.  Tragically, Gielgud's character dies thirty minutes into the movie, O'Toole's dies about fifteen minutes later and we're left with two more hours of movie.  A lot of the remaining two hours are filled with orgies, punctuated now and then with disgusting scenes of gratuitous violence. The plot fits in there someplace, sometimes, just as long as it doesn't get in the way of the orgies.\n\n Frankly, this is a mess.  The sets are big and gaudy, but poorly lit and phony looking.  McDowell's Caligula is simply repellent, as are all the other characters after Nerva's death.  The sex is soft core that verges towards the hard stuff now and then.  There are a lot of naked Penthouse Pets in this one, but watching them get it on with each other is no less boring than any other uninspired porn offering.  I wouldn't recommend CALIGULA to any but the curious, and only then as a rental.;In our dreams we are Caligula.

And maybe it was at the time, but as one of the millions of movie viewers who don't remember the 70's, who never had limits on the amount of sex and violence presented as entertainment (except, for better or worse, our parents), Caligula is not very shocking at all. It's terrible to admit being desensitized, but anyone who has ever watched both a porn movie and a single episode of any network cop drama can handle this.\nIt is important to watch the ""Making of Caligula"" feature with the DVD, as it explains everything that went into making the film. In many ways, this short film is more interesting than the movie itself. It's kind of sad, really, to see how Gore Vidal thought the movie would change the history of cinema and how much research and effort and money went into creating a Rome that ultimately looks like a porno movie but acts like a morality epic. If anything, it's evidence of the efforts in the 1970's to bring porn into mainstream cinema, of the time right before AIDS was discovered.

If you are looking for stricly historical film about Emperor Caligula, then the series ""I Claudius"" would be more of a better treatment.\n\nWatching the film is like watching a dream -- like one is entering the mind of the mad man.  It is often highly erotic filled with the rich texture of nude human flesh and sexuality and at other times horrifically violent, cruel, and disturbing.  Some scenes, including a mutilation scene are hard to take, but this does not detract from the overall richness. It is not your ordinary breed of film.  (Another similar film with plenty of nudity but without sex is ""Prospero's Books"".)\n\nIf you like unusual films with a lot of nudity, sex, exotic scenery and a bit of drama and history thrown in, then Caligula is for you.  But if you are put off by nudity, explicit sex, violence and the unusual, then you will hate it.";Caligula -- still hot and controversial
95;123.0;1.0;5.0;12.536896551724169;"""Caligula"" is the kind of film that reminded me of everything that was the opposite of good. The opposite of light. It also reminded me what the feeling of shame is all about. This is a terrible movie. I would put it right up there with ""Salo,or the 120 days of Sodom"" which I hail as the worst film ever made.""Caligula"" only serves its purpose of satisfying those with sick minds and it takes away the art of cinema. I have nothing more to say.";"""Caligula"" is full of shame. No stars."
99;124.0;1.0;5.0;-112.0686538461538;"The ""Spotlight Review"" is dead wrong; not only is Caligula's history pretty ridiculously bloody, violent, and sexual, the man himself went a whole heck of a lot further than this sad little flick does.  The key problem with ""Caligula"" isn't the violence, gore, or scanty hardcore porn footage anyway (if you're looking for those kind of jollies, look elsewhere), it's that these things were combined in a coldly cynical manner.  This is basically an attempt to cynically rack up the bucks.  Considering Guccione had to rent theaters to screen it, it makes you wonder just what the man was trying to prove.\nRegardless, this movie really stinks.  The cast does a great job, no denying that, but they just can't win against the mindlessness of the script (poor Gore Vidal, I can't blame him for fighting to get his name taken off) or the shoddy direction.  This isn't even a fun exploitation flick; there's no joy or sense of fun here.\nYou're better off with ""Killer Condom"", or most of the Troma flicks.  Or any hardcore porn disc if you're looking for that kind of stuff.  Don't waste your time on this; for once, Maltin nailed it.";Maltin pretty much nails it...

Tons of nakedness and sexy sexiness.\nNot for children, kid's got no business watching this sort of hanky-panky!  I think it should be against the damn law!\nOh goodness.  Also, the sea of freaks-sex show part in Tiberous magic cave almost put me over the edge.  Wowzers!  Is this stuff true?  I never heard of some of the stuff going on in the background of that bad news bear.\nAlso, Ben Hur was not in this movie at all, not even played by another actor.  And if I remember what our adult Sunday school teacher (the pastor's wife) told us correctly, I think that he and Caligula were friends.\nI don't know what to beleive anymore.\nI hoped this helped you... I love you.;Roman Nuptials- Or you're putting your fist where?
112;126.0;3.0;5.0;-145.88155737704915;"Movies like this look much better in print then they are.  ""The Most Controversial Movie in History"" is the best title for it.  It is one  of those movies that a bunch of guys rent on a Friday night just to see how  far it goes. Well having seen it I can say that it goes FAR!  WAY TOO FAR!  Do not get me wrong, the acting and the sets are wonderful (the actors that  aren't Penthouse pets or porn stars).  Malcom Macdowell is great in the  title role.  But the movie is just plain sickening.  The porn factor is one  thing (some of the most graphic sexual activity you will ever see in a  major motion picture) but the violence is way out of control.  There is no  redeaming value to watching dogs hungrily eat a man's genetaila after being  castrated.  And the sexual content goes beyond just the graphic orgies.  There is beastiality, necrophilia, homosexuality, midgetry, etc... Sorry  guys, you won't be watching this one in history class anytime soon.  The  movie makes you want to jump in the shower after it ends for there is  nothing clean about it at all.  It is really quite sickening.  But if you  watch it for the basic reason just so you can say you have seen it all,  then there is some value to the film I guess.  But be forwarned, it doen't  just push the limits, it destroys them.";WOAH!  Who forgot the good taste?

For the most part the  acting and timing are perfect.";Remastered? or re-edited?

I pre ordered this and waiting impatiently for it's arrival. It didn't disappoint! And as a bonus, it arrived while one of my grandsons was staying over. We promptly proceeded to watch the movie while catapulting animals across the room. A great time was had by all! Don't deprive yourself, your children or your grandchildren! Every home needs castle complete with catapult and animals!;Great Classic made even more fun!

This box set is way over-priced for just including a flimsy catapult set that you have to get exactly right or it won't fire. The novelty wears off quickly because the catapult sucks so much.  I tried to ambush my grown daughter with it, yet the cow flew backwards and hit me. Hard to put away once you attach the catapult correctly, and I was afraid disassembling it constantly would wear out the cardboard.\n\nThe film is old so it is quite grainy on Blu-ray, so no real improvement of picture quality.  There is only one disk.  Not a lot of extras for the price.  Just buy a regular DVD of the movie.\n\nNow go away, or I shall taunt you a second time!;Not worth the high price.

Well I was wrong. It looks and sounds Great!

And a silly price of only $9.99 (was $12.99 on release date).\n\nSony did a 1080p transfer(1.66:1 original aspect ratio) of this movie that looks amazing! There's lots of strong detail in faces, clothes, as well as surroundings like buildings, grass, trees. Flesh and earth tones look very natural. Blacks are deep. Strong color is not going to jump out at you, but that's just the nature of the film as the outdoor setting of much of the movie's grass, dirt, and rocks(browns, blacks, grays & greens) never contained strong color elements. But what color there is (like in the tabards,coat of arms, shields) looks very good indeed. Is the movie without soft shots or grain? No, but they've brought out a whole lot of nicely rendered detail that makes the movie a joy to watch. Until now, I feel like I've only seen this movie through a fog. Well, the fog has finally lifted and everything looks sooo fresh.\n\nThe audio is a lossless soundtrack (DTS-HD MA 5.1 lossless). Voices sound very crisp and clear. Sound effects in general are very good. Audiofiles will notice some very rich sounding sections, but also some that are just acceptable.

69;13.0;5.0;54.0;-450.38983240223456;"The grand opus of Monty Python, a goofy gang of guys who invented the most skewed comedy routines in the world. Rather than a series of individual spoofs, this movie is a long spoof based on Arthurian legend; specifically, the legend of the Holy Grail. Somehow, these six guys not only produced a low-budget movie, but cast themselves in multiple (many multiple) roles throughout it and still maintained a hilarious result!\nRather than a real story, this is a series of vignettes concerning the long-suffering King Arthur and his loyal knights of the Round Table (""We eat ham and jam and Spam-a-lot!"") Among them are:\n*The encounter with the Communist peasants in their autonamous collective (""HELP! HELP! I'M BEING REPRESSED!"")\n*The Tale of Sir Robin, the cowardly knight with a chicken on his shield.\n*The king's encounter with the loony black knight, in which a ridiculous series of blood-spurtings will have you guffawing. (""You've got no arms left!"" ""Yes I have!"" ""LOOK!"" ""It's just a flesh wound."")\n*Sir Lancelot receives a desperate note from a castle, but is the person sending it what he expects?\n*The French attack.... verbally. (""Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries!"")\n*Sir Galahad is waylaid in the temptation-laden Castle of the Maidens (interestingly enough, in traditional legends Sir Galahad did go to the Castle of the Maidens, though in very different circumstances *leer*)\n*The Keepers of the Sacred Word, the Knights Who Say ""NI!""\n*The rabbit of death, Tim the Enchanter, and so much more.\nThe sheer off-the-wallness is what sells this movie, and Monty Python was in rare form. Graham Chapman's primary role is King Arthur, who seems to be the most competant of the bunch but is still pretty goofy. John Cleese of ""Fish"" and ""Fawlty Towers"" fame stars as Sir Lancelot/Tim the Wizard/The Rude Frenchman, and is amazing in each role. Eric Idle plays lily-livered Sir Robin/Roger the Shrubber (don't ask)/Brother Maynard. Terry Gilliam is lower-key as Sir Gawain/Patsy; Terry Jones is also pretty low key as Sir Bedivere/Prince Herbert. Michael Palin has a hilarious series of roles including the King os Swamp Castle/Sir Galahad/Leader of the Knights Who Say Ni.\nShoring up the cast is Cleese's now-ex-wife Connie Booth as The Witch, John Young as the Historian/Dead Body, Neil Innes as the annoying Minstrel/Page Killed by Rabbit.\nPerhaps the funniest move in this movie was mocking the budget limitations, with the coconut shells and so forth. The special effects are deliberately cheapened to make them sillier, such as the sprays of rather gloppy gore when someone is wounded. The script is typically hilarious, full of stupid comments and straight-faced jokes.\nFrankly, it's hard to think of Camelot now without rhyming it with ""I have to push the PRAM-A-LOT"" and the line of tap-dancing knights. This movie is lodged in the American brain, and it ain't budging soon...\nA small note: You may want to check out the Veggie Tales ep ""Josh and the Big Wall,"" in which a respectful (yet kooky!) homage is paid to this film!";One of the funniest movies ever made

11;15.0;5.0;18.0;-450.70491620111727;"I've been a Monty Python fan my entire life, and a huge fan of this film in particular. This is the best that MP&THG has ever looked, and perhaps as good as it ever will, or even can, look or sound.\n\nInstead of rehashing what has already been said about the film itself and the shiny new 1080p video, I'd like to focus on a few of the extras, and what exactly is different about this release compared to the previous DVD release.\n\nMost of the extras (Holy Grail locations, etc.) were all on the earlier DVD, but the new additions, the Outtakes and Lost Animations, are real gems available for the first time only on this Blu-Ray.\n\nThe Outtakes consist of longer versions of some scenes, which were understandably cut or shortened, but there are also some alternate takes and screw-ups with the cast forgetting lines or laughing in the middle of a take. It's all great fun, and a humorous look behind the scenes at an already drop-dead hilarious movie.\n\nTerry Gilliam's Lost Animations are a hoot. We see a few spare parts that may not have had any particular intent, but there is also an extended opening to The Tale of Sir Robin, involving a collapsing cathedral, a stray rock catapulted into the sky and knocking out a flying dragon-like creature which then falls into the title card, impaling its mouth, collapsing, thus creating the ""R"" in ""Robin.""  And there is also an extended opening to ""The Tale of Sir Lancelot"" in which a cartoon Lancelot battles a giant slug. Total Gilliam lunacy at his stream-of-consciousness best!\n\nThe only cut scene I wish had been included as an extra is ""King Brian the Wild,"" which is a scene that was written but never shot. It appears only as a pencil sketch animation with sound on the Holy Grail video game that came out during the Dark Ages of video games. Unless it's an easter egg on this disc, or if it appears in the ""Holy Book of Days,"" which I have not had a chance to explore yet.\n\nThere are a couple of things missing from the Blu-Ray, including the ""Follow the Rabbit"" feature from the previous DVD. That feature would be useless here anyway, since the new ""Holy Book of Days"" downloadable feature promises to be far more extensive and comprehensive.  Also, the false opening ""Dentist on the Job"" short is not at the start of the film. Not a deal-breaker, of course, but if you are fond of that ephemeral opening gag, then hang on to your DVD.\n\nThe Blu-Ray menus are much better than the DVD menus, which I always thought were rather tedious and impossible to by-pass.\n\nThe various audio tracks, commentaries and subtitles (including the Japanese language track and the Henry VI subtitles) are all there, but on the DVD the default audio was the original mono track. Here the default is the more recent stereo remaster, including Michael Palin's re-recording of the narration.\n\nThis Blu-Ray release is a very impressive return to a fantastic comedy that has stood the test of time.";Holy Grail Blu-Ray Review
8;16.0;3.0;11.0;-547.1120700636942;"Love the movie.  One of my favorites.  Love the transfer to blu-ray.  Crystal clear for the most part (a few scenes were apparently more problematic to transfer and are still pretty blurry, and it can be jarring when you come across those scenes because they really do stand out).  The extras are limited but interesting, and informative, with the possible exception of Terry Gilliam's commentary on the lost animation sequences.  (He really didn't sound very happy to be doing them.)\n\nHowever, the ""Ultraviolet Digital Copy"" feature on this disc (which is adminstered by Sony) is entirely worthless.  You may think you are getting an actual copy of the movie to watch on your ipod, iPad, or other device at your leisure, right?  WRONG.  The downloadable copy is for your desktop or other primary computer ONLY.  And in order to get that, you must create an account with Sony, give them your personal information, and install their proprietary software (Silverlight) to download and view the copy.  After giving them my name, email and other information (and agreeing to allow them to send me marketing materials at that email address, which YOU MUST DO to proceed with the account creation - there is no way to opt out and still continue), jumping through all the installation hoops and installing Silverlight, it took my computer an additional 6 and one half hours over high-speed DSL to download this +/- 90 munite epic.  Amazing speed and efficiency, no?  Incidentally, the download also overheated and burned out my old DSL modem.\n\nAfter all that, I tried to transfer the downloaded movie to iTunes.  Guess what?  You can't.  If you want to download it to a mobile device, you have to install additional software, go through the Ultraviolet site again, and essentially repeat the download process on that device.  God only knows how long it will take to download it agfain using an A5 chip...  Then, you can view the movie at your leisure on your mobile device, right?  Not according to the folks who have tried it!  If you are foolish enough to remove your mobile device from your house, you're out of luck!  You see, if you get outside the range of your WiFi connection, the movie will not be viewable.  Apparently the digital copy needs to contact Sony every time you try to view it.  Just a little quirk that Sony forgot to mention to you!  Want to take a copy of the movie on vacation?  Too bad!  Long car or plane ride?  Too bad!  Maybe someone should call Sony and inform them of the meaning of the word ""mobile"" so they stop advertising their ""digital copy"" for your ""mobile device"".\n\nSo, buy this blu-ray version movie if you only want the movie itself and do not want the ""digital copy"" (sorry I keep putting it in quotes, but I feel like, if there is no actual copy of the film that you can move around between devices, in what sense do you have an actual ""copy"" of anything?) go ahead and buy it.  Frankly, I can't recommend the movie enough.  Just don't expect to be able to use the ""digital copy"" that comes with it.\n\nPS:  There are a number of movies (like James Cameron's new release of ""Titanic"" on blu-ray) that come with actual, bona fide digital copies. You plug a download code into iTunes, and it downloads automatically.  And you can watch that on any device you transfer a copy to.  Just look for the little ""iTunes"" logo on the cover.  And stay away from anything marked with ""Ultraviolet"".  Ultraviolet is not worth the money, not worth the hassle, not worth the time.  In short, UV copies are worthless.";Ultraviolet Copy Is Useless

Here's my question:  I see each year that the smarter the kid the harder they laugh.  I don't mean to sound elitist but my honors classes hoot and holler.  My ""general"" students, who are proud of having read ""a"" book in middle school, sometimes laugh at the slapstick and then there are a significant number who mutter the whole time, ""This is so stupid, why are we watching this? This is stupid....and so on."" I start to get fed up after the first two mutters because:  1) They could be deconstructing *War and Peace* if I was in a really bad mood and  2) I love this movie.  I warn them ahead of time that they might not ""get"" all of the satire (peasant/king political debate) but how can you resist a line about a moist bit throwing scimitars at you  or a watery tart etc.  This movie is very, very smart and very, very funny.  Anyway, I propose we throw out the traditional IQ test and show this to high schoolers to assess their intelligence or at least intellectual potential.  How can you not love this movie?

I know you people are thinking  ""yeah well, you just didn't understand the spoof on the King arthur legend"".  Oh, I understood it alright.  Just because a parody makes sense doesn't mean that it is funny.\nKnights that go ""Nee""?  Wow, that's clever.  I'm sure the creators of this movie were in a meeting thinking real hard about this one when the boss's son comes up with this cockbarf.

30;21.0;5.0;16.0;-254.04279661016943;"I had my first exposure to Monty Python as a very young child, when their shows were first being broadcast in the US in the mid '70s and my folks would watch them.  Then I saw this movie on Cinemax around 1982...and again the following day.  (By the way, Spiny Normal gives it two prickly thumbs up...Dinsdale!)  After which I promptly went out and bought...*dramatic pause*...a SHRUBBERY!! *Dramatic music!*  I laughed, I cried, I wet my pants (well, all right, not really), I did a few Silly Walks.\n\nThe genius of the Pythons simply cannot be overstated.  Holy Grail was made on a shoestring budget, yet the lads managed to wring the maximum amount of laughs and silliness out of the Arthurian legends to great effect on that budget.  From the use of coconuts to imitate the sound of hoofbeats, to the burning of a witch because she's made of wood and floats on water like a duck (""Cor, she turned me into a newt!"" ""A newt?!"" ""(Long pause)...I got better...""), to Castle Anthrax and lots of good spankings, to the Bridge of Death (""WHAT...is your favourite COLOUR?!"" ""Blue!""

They make it much easier for you and your friends to spend countless hours quoting the film back and forth at each other...and the lines are VERY quotable.\n\nAnd the general quality of the film in the special edition is greatly improved; the prior DVD release had muddy sound and murky images, and while the film was enjoyable nevertheless, you still felt a little cheated--after all, the DVD is supposed to be an improvement over the old VHS.

It is not my intention to convince non-Christians that they should convert, nor is it my intention to convince other Christians that they must agree with my opinions.  What follows is simply my view of this item through the lens of my understanding of the Christian faith, so I trust that none will be offended by points-of-view I express with which they disagree.  Peace.\n\nThis movie is really a parody of two things.  First, it is a parody of the Middle Ages in England.  Second, it is a parody of our modern presuppositions of that time.  It is because the door of parody swings both ways in this film that it is able to be so incredibly funny.  Parody is funny because there is an element of truth involved.  Here, there are two truths, thus the film is twice as funny: there is the truth concerning the Middle Ages, and there's the truth concerning our impressions of the Middle Ages.  By cracking fun at both of these sources of truth, the Monty Python comedy group was able to produce solid parody that is smart, witty, and and in some ways convicting.  Overall, the film is very enjoyable and fun to watch and re-watch.\n\nAs a Christian, however, I have a couple of minor reservations about watching this film.  First, though by no means comparable to much of the filth that comes out of Hollywood these days, this movies has a fair share of foul language.  Some of the worst incidents of foul language are likely to go unnoticed because of the accent/language barrier and the manner of production.  For example, at one point the film cuts quickly to a character from a previous scene who says that at least his scene didn't involve a litany of a certain category of sex jokes.  Here, this character uses a less than appropriate word which is not even appropriate for me to repeat.  However, it goes by so fast that I didn't even notice it until the third or fourth time I watched the movie.\n\nMost of the foul language used is less overtly offensive, and especially because much of this language seems to be well established within the English-comedy tradition it is almost fair to say that it's an essential part of making a funny parody of this sort.  Needless to say, if you are uncomfortable with some incidents of foul language, or if you simply don't think such usage is funny, this movie probably is not for you.  This movie also contains one scene with a significant amount of sexual innuendo and here there is even a reference to oral sex.  However, insofar as this scene does not contain any overtly sexual content of a graphic nature, I think it is not so bad as to require Christians to avoid watching the movie altogether.\n\nI give this movie five stars because it is very funny and smart.  It is an example of a type of humor that is hard to come by these days.  However, I would hesitate to give this movie to anyone younger than 18 or so; I know that when I watched this movie for the first time when I was 15 I did not have the spiritual maturity to discriminate between the quality parody and the few incidents of inappropriate tastelessness.  Other than that, this movie is a classic, and I hope you enjoy it!";A Christian Perspective

26;26.0;4.0;12.0;-323.67180451127814;"As a teacher of medieval Grail literature, I have shown ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" to many generations of students -- and indeed there are a number of scenes that really do help young people understand either the medieval literary tradition or medieval history. These include not only the unforgettable ""Bring out your dead scene,"" which educates the fortunate modern viewer on the ubiquity of the medieval Bubonic Plague, but also the Grail Castle with its unimaginable and unaskable question, not to mention the over-the-top battle ethos that would lead to a knight's having not only his arms and legs cut off but also his head! It's hard to believe that such scenes have their medieval progenitors (though I do have to say I know of no medieval precedent for the ""shrubbery"" scene), but honestly they do.\n\nMore than that, however, in my book the very best scene of this film has absolutely nothing to do with the Grail or with anything medieval -- and that is the scene of the fierce rabbit. I still cannot watch this film without cracking up (as we moderns say) over the scene in which the ""harmless little rabbit"" attacks the Arthurian troupe. The hubris that the rabbit scene uncovers is a sadly (but hilariously) universal feature of human nature.\n\nBut even the rabbit scene hooks back into the medieval theme, as it links to an exploration of a cave with literary texts that conclude because ""....arrgh...."" Well, indeed, many medieval texts remain unfinished, perhaps because the authors died, more likely due to the vagaries of preservation. So Monty Python has something to say not only about history and literature but about literary history; in its very aesthetic form, this film reminds us that the standard linear narrative is not the only way of organizing a story. Many medieval stories are likewise structured either allegorically or with significant disruptions, such as this film has, that reveal that a story is something that is constructed and has its gaps and interventions.\n\nIn the ""Age of the Da Vinci Code"" -- another far less successful Grail story --  I'd be happy to see folks go back to Monty Python for their understanding of medieval literature and Chrisitainity.

Thirty years have elapsed since its original release, but it is still a movie that veers wildly back and forth between hilariously inventive and downright silly.  If you can hold on tight, it's a worthwhile ride. Almost arbitrarily about a band of adventurers looking for the famed Holy Grail, the movie is just an excuse to create a nonsensical world steeped in medieval history and comically ironic violence. Directed by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, it is typical Monty Python fare, which means a lot of clever wordplay and elaborate sight gags with big payoffs. The story begins with King Arthur and his page Patsy galloping on their invisible horses with their clapping coconut half-shells, as they search for worthy knights to take back to Camelot. From there, we meet a cast of characters that only makes sense in Python-land: an increasingly armless and legless Black Knight with a chip on his shoulder, a big Trojan Horse-like wooden rabbit, some disrespectful Frenchmen, castle-bound nymphomaniac maidens, the knights who dare to say ""Ni!"", a pedantic historian in the present day and even God, who seems rather impatient with the befuddled knights as He explains their quest for the Holy Grail. Amid these disparate elements, the film holds together as a clever satire on blind pious ignorance and the unquestioning acceptance of organized religion. The pacing gets sluggish toward the end, but the conclusion is riotous and just in time.\n\nWell packaged, the two-disc set has several extras. The main menu on the first disc is funny in itself with an option for the hard of hearing. There are two alternative commentary tracks. The first is newer and features Idle, John Cleese and Michael Palin; the second was recorded much earlier with Gilliam and Jones. Both are informative but only fitfully funny since they defer to the movie. The second disc has ""Mindless Sing-Alongs!"", where three scenes are taken from the film and subtitled so that once can sing along to the amusing ""Knights of the Round Table"" (which inspired the Broadway show title, ""We dine well here in Camelot, we eat ham and jam and spam a lot.""), ""Sir Robin"" or chant along in ""Monk's Chant"". There is a hysterical little ""educational"" short entitled ""How to Use Your Coconut"" and two scenes dubbed in Japanese. But the highlight is a 45-minute documentary called ""The Quest for the Holy Grail Locations,"" in which Jones and Palin explore the various film locations with humor and a sense of deserved nostalgia. Other features include a mock interview with the cast done during the filming, a Lego version of ""The ""Knights of the Round Table"" song and various sundry features suitable primarily for a Pythonite. For non-Pythonites, the film is still worth a look at a comedy that only looks better with all the witless dreck produced now.";Python Silliness Still Holds Up in Special Two-Disc Set

Much of their work was a humorous combination of the creative, farcical, and surreal, such that the group's influence on subsequent comedy was significant. In ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", they tried their hand at a feature length film that spoofed the Arthurian legends and the quest for the holy grail, with a parody of the chivalrous knights of medieval tales. Being a fan of the Arthurian legends and of parody, it was this combination that first attracted me to this film, as well as the fact that it is often regarded as one of the greatest comedy films of all time.\n\nBut does Monty Python & the Holy Grail live up to this reputation?  The influence and popularity of Monty Python is indisputable, but that does not mean that this comedy troupe has found favour from all quarters. Certainly they display the potential to come up with some extraordinarily creative and original humor, appreciated especially by those who find the surreal and absurd in any way funny.  But it is regrettable that the humor of their television shows often descends into the risque and irreverent.  Monty Python and the Holy Grail is no different in that it contains both the usual brand of Python humor, as well as a significant amount of irreverence and sexual innuendo. Some parts are funny, in fact tremendously so, for who can ever forget the defeat of the killer rabbit with Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, the three-headed Knights that say ""Ni--!"", the Bridge of Death with its absurd riddles, and the closing scenes where our heroic knights are conquer the grail, only to be arrested by British policemen.  But the clever humor doesn't excuse the large amounts of blasphemous material, which frequently is used as a source of humor in connection with the religious aspects of the grail. Monty Python took their irreverence even a step further in a subsequent film, Life of Brian, which is a parody of the Biblical Messiah Jesus Christ. But it's not just unholy religious humor that's problematic here - discerning viewers should realize that ""the Holy Grail"" also contains some risque sexual innuendo in the usual Monty Python style.  And these moral concerns aside, there are cases in ""the Holy Grail"" where the surreal attempts at humor just aren't funny, but stupid.\n\nCritiquing a sacred cow is always dangerous, not least when this films is regarded one of comedy's holy grails.  But those of us who err on the side of conservatism with our moral standards will want to give this film a miss. For a more innocent parody of chivalry which avoids the unholiness and irreverence of this humor, try instead Goldman's The Princess Bride. - GODLY GADFLY";A holy grail of comedy proves rather unholy.

Pure comedic genius that doesn't go stale with age or decades of competition having been released. Simply seeing the way comedy films are made today, this film will very likely have a long reign before anything can even hold a candle to it. An absolute belly-laugh fest that never lets up.\n\nOnly the cast of Monty Python could have pulled this film off, with each actor playing many different characters...all hilarious! The genius in the actors' lines themselves are truly to be admired. The comedic style of talking in circles is one technique that most comedies do not try to do, simply because they can't compete with the genius of this film, which uses it flawlessly. Those that do try usually fall flat on their faces. Two particularly excellent examples of this can be seen in the beginning scene, in which the characters discuss the origins of coconuts.....and the other when Lancelot breaks into the swamp castle to save the ""damsel in distress."" This is merely one technique that the cast has perfected to conjure up laughs consistently throughout the entire film. The only way that I can imagine that someone might not like this film is if they simply do not enjoy it's type of humor. Too bad for them.\n\nAnother hilarious technique used in the film is the use of comedy in the background. From people slamming cats against poles for no apparent reason, to people filling up baskets with mud in the fields....all very strange and hilarious at the same time. It's also simply amazing that all of the characters are played by the same group of actors, which shows the great range all of them have. Some are simply unrecognizable from one character to the other and it sometimes takes a good eye to pick them out, which makes it fun. And I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but this film takes some turns that no sane person could see coming.\n\nRidiculous characters in ridiculous situations equals ridiculous laughter.\n\nThe epitome of all-star comedy that will no doubt continue to stand the test of time.

The extra features on these disc are outstanding (again, the same features you get with the SE DVD); the animated menus are hilarious and I especially like the lego rendition of the Camelot song.\nThe one thing about the collector's set that's kind of annoying, they have only one peg to put the DVDs onto so one of your DVDs is put directly on top of the other one.  The top disc tends to fall off the peg and could potentially get scratched in shipment (like my first one did before I exchanged it); also when you securely fasten the discs they can be kinda hard to take out.

72;52.0;3.0;9.0;-149.54928571428567;Essentially a series of sketches with a medieval theme, this is less structured than 'Life of Brian', and operations on a sillier level  entirely. You've probably seen it half-a-dozen times already, and on DVD  it's just as funny as it is on VHS, but with a slightly nicer picture and a  smaller box. That's pretty much all you get, too - the wonderful Criterion  version of 'Life of Brian' is a taster of what can be done with DVD, and  the lack of extras makes this less interesting. What sets the film itself  apart from the competition (not that there is any) is the attention to  detail, the desire to create a stylish portrayal of medieval England on a  minute budget (less than a quarter of a million dollars, in fact). It works  well - location footage in Scotland and lots and lots of smoke give the  production an 'Exclaibur'-esque look of grim and gritty reality, and this  is what sticks in the mind after the film is over. It's extremely funny,  but you know that already - as with all Python, you can watch it again and  again, spotting lines and performances you hadn't noticed beforehand. Given  that no special effort has been put into the presentation, and given that  'Holy Grail' is hardly THX material anyway, you'd probably be better off  with the standard VHS version.

Now when I say I was in high school, I mean I was actually sitting in English Lit class as a learning experience. Not surprisingly, this class was taught by the same teacher who gave away beer mugs, which he tried to convince everyone were milk mugs. Needless to say this was the greatest class I had in my educational career.\n\nBut the great thing about Monty Python I that it actually works on an educational level with high brow comedy that the uneducated may not get. There were plenty of references that dealt with obscure British history may not get so while watching it in class we would watch a scene and laugh at it's sophomoric humor, then the teacher would rewind it and point out the little things that us, the uneducated wouldn't get, then have a laugh at the deeper meaning.\n\nYet it is still the silliness that draws people to the Monty Python franchise, and there is plenty of that in the Holy Gail. In addition to the French dude that uttered the title phrase, some of my personal favorite parts are, the Black Knight who wouldn't die, the Holy Hand Grenade and the Knights Who Say Ni. And as part of the English Lit class, we learned the ""Ni"" was actually a curse word back in olden times, so for me that added to the humor of the scene.\n\nAnd unlike virtually every DVD released, the all the extras are worth checking out and also boasts what I think is the only movie that offers for your listening pleasure a ""Mono soundtrack in glorious old-fashioned mono!"" Plus as an added bonus there is ""A glorious 24 seconds absolutely free!"" although don't ask me where that is from. There are also there rare audio commentaries that are actually interesting, one with Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones and another with John Cleese, Eric Idle, and Michael Palin. Also there a plenty of great documentaries, three sin-alongs, and a cast directory to keep track of how many characters each actor played. And if you can't get enough ridiculousness, you can watch the film in Japanese with English Subtitles as they search for the holy sake cup and even a Lego version of the film.

This film also contains the greatest `deus ex machina' ending in the history of cinema with police interrupting Arthur's last glorious charge.

Once I accomplished the extraction, I struggled for a long while, trying to figure out how to place the second DVD back in the cumbersome box of not-quite-so-sturdy construction, which basically fell apart after opening. However, is it not in the spirit of Monty Python, to have this opus magnum housed in a box whose condition mimics this of the cheap collapsing Camelot model in the film? I placed the second DVD in an empty plastic box and proceeded to discover the wonders of this deranged collection- which is great beyond words.\nFor starters, there is The Senitype, ""a single 33-milimeter frame from the original motion picture negative"", which comes framed in a cardboard file describing how to start collecting the yearly editions of the frame and warns you that while it is not a laxative.... well, you need to get the box to find out the rest.\nThe print edition of the script, the singalongs, the documentaries, the subtitles for People Who Don't Like the Film, the Japanese version of the movie and the Lego Block version of the Camelot Scene (my favourite!).. It will take you a couple of hours, at least, to go through the whole magnificent lot.\nThis is one collector's edition which lives up to its title, and it does it to the optional soundtrack in ""glorious old-fashion mono"", and animated menus with ""very loud surround sound.""

Hard to fathom considering that it's supposed to be an inspired and comedic take on King Arthur. I popped the dvd expecting a witty, satirical parody based on what some friends told me. What I got was time taken away from what I could've been doing. Like, wrapping my nuts around copper wiring and testing it's conductivity with a lightning rod. I tried to watch through the entire thing but had to stop halfway through and finish it some other time because when I wasn't bored out of my mind, I was constantly picking on the stupidity of it all. I will come out and say that SOME bits at the very beginning were pretty funny in a silly-ass kind of way (the coconuts and the socialist peasant). But I would have to say that the humor just isn't there for me the rest of the way. Some border on infantile while others border on what the hell did I just see. It was that awful. Maybe the reason people revere this movie so much is because they defer to the comedy troupe. Well, then I would have to say thay this is the wrong movie to revere.

They realized that the quest for the Holy Grail would lend itself nicely to a series of sketches focusing on each knight. For a climax, they planned on sending the knights into Herrods department store to buy the grail (because, after all, Herrods sells everything).\nBut somewhere along the way, this collection of medieval skits became one of the best comedies ever made. You could credit the use of authentic sets and costumes. For some reason, making the movie historically accurate makes it funnier. Or you could credit the way they used their painfully low budget --- like using different sides of a castle to represent multiple castles in the story. If you notice it, you get an extra laugh. Or you could credit the use of two directors, forcing everyone to get it right the first time to avoid two sets of solutions to every problem.\nWhatever the reason, Monty Python and the Holy Grail holds up as one of the best comedies ever filmed. It still looks cheesy, but in a good way. The plot is full of nice big holes, too. Every time you see it, you notice something new and miss something you've memorized. The jokes don't wait for a laugh track. It's just one strange punchline after another.\nFor the special edition of the DVD, the five living Pythons put together a handful of extra bits. The best extras are the audio tracks. You hear the directors talk about set design, John Cleese complains about being wet and cold, and Michael Palin explains why everything is funny. The documentary in which the two Terrys (the directors) visit the old filming locations is fun, too. They still have their sense of humor about it all.

Well, this is the retelling of the story of King Arthur, his uniting with the Knights of the Round Table at Camelot, and of course, the search for the Holy Grail--all told in a British humor fashion. Pointless, you may say, but still funny as hell nonetheless. And what a funny crew of Knights of Camelot, too; we have: Arthur, King of the Britons, Sir Bedevere the Wise (I think), Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Gallahad the Pure, and Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot. When a new strategy was planned along the way though, the Knights split up and went seperate ways to find the Grail, and that's when the comedy ensues. You'll see Sir Robin meet a giant three-headed knight whose three heads bicker at each other; Sir Gallahad run into a castle filled with sex-driven maidens; Sir Lancelot try to rescue a princess locked in a castle only to find out it's really a wussy prince trying to escape from being forced by his father to marry someone in favor of the bride's landscape; and King Arthur and Sir Bedevere meet the Knights who say ""Ni!"" that order the two to find a shrubbery with their necks at stake. In addition you'll find the entire crew meet up a castle full of disrespectful French and a certain rabbit...\n\nNow on to the DVD itself. The video quality here has been remastered, but not restored; the picture is still grainy and muddy, but the colors are bright and solid nonetheless. The audio  quality could've been better, though.

The Dolby 5.1 track, though, is much clearer than the mono, but doesn't thump the entire house-a good track anyway.\n\nAs with the extras, there's plenty to keep you happy. The first disc contains two fun commentary tracks by the Pythonites themselves and a Pop-up video track for storyboard comparisons.\nAlso included are subtitles ""for people who don't like the film"".

For starters, we have two fun featurettes: ""The Quest For the Holy Grail Locations"" where Terry Jones and Michael Palin show which landscapes were the entire movie shot; and ""How to use your Coconuts"", an interesting feature on how to carve your coconut to a point where you can start banging them to make a trotting horse sound.\nAlso there's an interesting newscast featurette called ""On Location with the Pythons"", where the BBC News crew talks to the Python crew about the making of the film. In addition you'll also get art and photo galleries, it's theatrical trailer, Three Sing-alongs from the film, and a few more pointless features for the Python fan.\n\nIn conclusion, I still like the film as much as the DVD treatment here.

29;66.0;5.0;5.0;-24.774999999999977;Monty Python and the holy grail is without a doubt on the essental comedies of all time. This Comedy Classic is one of my top 10 movies. The whole movie is about King Arther and his knights (Gallahad, Sir Robin, Lancealot, Sir Not appearing in this film, ect) and there quest for the holy grail and also to find out if a 1 ounce swallow can carry a one pound coconut. You also have classic characters like The French Guards, The Knights who say ni, The evil Rabbit, The Black Beast of AAGGGHHHHHH, and don't forget Tim the enchanter. This movie is what is one of the greatest comedies. Possibly the best Python Movie of the 3. Get this movie I highly recomendit.;One of my top 10 movies... The Funniest Movie of all time
37;67.0;5.0;5.0;-274.9583914209115;"Not only is Monty Python and the Search for the Holy Grail one of the funniest films ever made and a classic of Western Cinema, the folks across the pond have set a new standard for DVDs.\n\nIf you are a fan of British comedy or are the kind of person who would find catapulting a wooden rabbit funny, this is your kind of film.  I have yet to run into someone who has seen it who walked away disappointed; I have found far more people who will quote from it at the drop of a hat.\n\nThe plot is relatively simple: the gang are playing Arthur, Lancelot, Gallahad and others in the search for the Holy Grail.  Along the way Arthur has to use the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch to take out a killer rabbit while Gallahad (the Pure) has to be rescued from nymphomaniacs.  As a word of warning if this is your first time watching the film, the ending comes suddenly and you may be confused if there's more; when the music starts, the film is done.\n\nThe features on this DVD are up to the high standards of Monty Python.  Although the film has not been noticably restored, when you get right down to it you don't watch Monty Python for the speical effects.  There are subtitles in several languages, including a set for people who don't like the movie (the subtitles in that case are taken from Henry IV, Part II, though they are out of sequence to go along with the action on screen).  They have redone parts of the film in Lego.  They have a sing-along.  They have an instructional film on how to use coconuts.  In other words, there are a lot of unique to bizarre features that will keep you entertained for hours.\n\nThis DVD is a rare two-for-one: if you've never seen Monty Python before, it's an exellent introduction to what is probably their best-known work.  If you are a big Monty Python fan, you get a ton of features to entertain you, not to mention the film.  It's too bad other 'special editions' of films haven't been this well done.";Camelot...It is a silly place

I personally find it to be completely hilarious, I love every minute of it.  Some of the extras are quite good too, like the little documentary about all the locations used, and the how-to movie about the coconuts.  Watching the movie w/ the comments from John Cleese, Eric Idle and Michael Palin was also funny and very insightful.  Overall, a great buy that I don't regret in the least.  The only problem I've had is that it is incredibly difficult to get the disks out of the case w/o fear of breaking them, but once you get them out, its definitely worth the trouble!;"Don't ""run away, run away!"""

The Black Knight, the wedding in the swamp, the Killer Rabbit, the Knights  Who Say, ""Ni!""...too many priceless moments to count, all of  which make MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL a comedy classic.  So why the  four-star review?  Because, unfortunately, for every inspired moment  there's a dull one, a lame stab at humor that doesn't pay off.  First-time  audiences might be laughing too hard to notice, but repeat viewings just  don't hold up--quite frankly, this movie is downright boring in some  places.  Feel free to watch it with a big group of friends (the opening  credits alone will bring down the house), but don't expect an unbroken  stream of laughter.

For Python  purists, this truely is the HOLY GRAIL.  Carry on the hilarity by seeing  John Cleese in 'Faulty Towers' (available in U.S. on video). By his own  admission, this was the finest work by Cleese and the reason he made only 2  seasons and no more telly shows.

53;73.0;5.0;5.0;-531.4786567164178;"Of all the films and television programs produced by airborne members of the Flying Circus, I consider this to be their greatest achievement. Co-authored and then co-directed Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones (two rather silly people indeed), this film makes at least some effort to recreate a distant period in history and from a somewhat 20th century perspective. Apparently available funds were limited because Gilliam and Junes could not afford to rent horses and thus were forced to simulate them with body language and coconut half shells. Also, various members of the Ye Olde Merrie Companie were required to play several different roles...on occasion at the same time. For example, Graham Chapman as King Arthur as well as (or as unwell as) the Three-Headed Knight and the Hiccoughing Guard. Eric Idle ia also actively involved as Sir Robin, Maynard, Roger, a Guard, and the Historian Who Isn't A.J.P. Taylor...plus some other stuff my limited space precludes noting. One of Gilliam and Jones's cleverest strategies is to juxtapose 6th century Breton with 20th century England. Actually, not only juxtapose them but to have the former and latter interact without prior warning. Yes, this creates some confusion but the plot lags on fewer occasions and younger persons in the audience will feel more at home.\nAccording to various historical sources, there was not one Arthur but hundreds...perhaps thousands in 6th century England. Indeed, here in Dallas in the year 2003, there are thousands of Arthurs now living in the North Texas region. How many kings? Ooodles of Kings but no kings; however, back then (i.e. 6th century), there were quite a few.\nAccording to generally reliable research sources, for example, Geoffrey of Monmouth (about 1100-1155 A.D.) recorded Arthur as a High-King of Britain. He was the son of his predecessor, Uther Pendragon and nephew of King Ambrosius. As a descendant of High-King Eudaf Hen's nephew, Conan Meriadoc, Arthur's grandfather, had crossed the Channel from Brittany and established the dynasty at the beginning of the 5th century. The Breton King Aldrien had been asked to rescue Britain from the turmoil in which it found itself after the Roman administration had departed. He sent his brother, Constantine, to help. Constantine appears to have been the historical self-proclaimed British Emperor who took the last Roman troops from Britain in a vain attempt to assert his claims on the Continent in 407. Chronologically speaking, it is just possible he was King Arthur's grandfather. Arthur's Breton Ancestry was recorded by Gallet.\nOf course, historical material such as this brought tears of joy to the eyes of both Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones (also their parents). They were inspired by it to bring the story of King Arthur and the Holy Grail to the sometimes silver screen. This they have done. Truly, the Pendragons are the stuff of legend. Predictably, Gilliam and Jones took certain liberties to achieve enhanced dramatic effect, adding some important new information revealed by their own historical research. For example, details about martial arts for quadriplegics, the Sepulcher of the Holy Grenade and its Killer Rabbit, aerodynamics of various species of migrating swallows, and interior decorating (e.g. curtains) in 6th century royal quarters. Exciting new stuff indeed.\nWho said in 1974 that ""They just don't make great movies anymore""? Well, whoever said that could not be more wrong.\nFor proof, they are herewith directed to the abundance of materials which are available only with the DVD version of this film. If they are still not convinced, I fart in their general direction.";Welcome to the Sixth Century
54;74.0;2.0;5.0;-238.1857142857142;I'm not sure what it is that I don't like about this movie. It seems there is something off balance that is apparent from the opening sequence. Obviously all the reveiws for this movie were written by fans. Most people who wouldn't like this movie most likely have not heard of it, or barely remember. It does not leave a lasting impression unless you find it hilarious. Filmed on a shoestring budget and probably in locations within just a few miles of each other, this movie is a journey into the bizarre and dryer then a dessert humor of one of Englands most popular comedy troups. Rest assured, if you like English humor, this movie will most likely leave you rolling on the floor. For some who just can't laugh that hard at it, you may find yourself giving up on it early. There is some tremendously funny writing and some very cerebal wit. For example, the argument about whether a swallow can carry a coconut during it's migration. The taunting of the Frenchman from the top of the castle wall. The dual with the black knight, and the killer bunny. The hightlight being the peasent in the road who King Arthur mistakes for an old woman and gets a tougue lashing for the simple mistake. Even these moments though rely on the bizarre circumstance that these people don't ride horses but pretend to with the sounds they make with two coconuts to show you that there is absolutly nothing to be taken seriously and nothing that shouldn't be considered off the wall. This movie seems funnier when quoteing lines in the company of friends, rather then watching it straight out. My personal tastes do not run to something this unbalanced, but I realize it is adored by many. So to those who enjoy it, knock yourselves out. To those who enjoy more straight foward smart comedy, I would suggest Real Genius.;Not so funny
56;75.0;4.0;5.0;-236.81318181818182;"I know many other reviewers have brought this up, but on a SONY DVD player, during certain scenes, rabbits and subtitles pop up unintentionally. There is a rabbit feature: when a rabbit comes up, you click on it, and it tells you production secrets (it is called ""the killer rabbit""). This is great if you like that, but if you're not interested in it, there's no real way around it. Every thirty seconds, you have rabbits popping up, even when you turn them off. This DVD is actually cheaper than the one-disc bare bones edition, yet people have spent more money to get that just so they don't have to deal with these stupid rabbits.\n\nThe frustrating thing is, this DVD wasn't just slapped together. The picture looks crystal clear compared to old copies on VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD. The high definition widescreen presentation looks amazing; it's by far the best I've seen this film look. The soundtrack has a very loud 5.1 that is very cool, especially if you've always heard the film in mono. (If you prefer mono, it's there, too.)\n\nThere are two commentary tracks, with 4 of the actors on one and the 2 directors on the other. I know that the one with the 2 directors is taken from the Criterion Laserdisc, which is neither good not bad. The scene selection is okay, and the extra 24 seconds are unnecessary. Disc two has sing alongs, documentaries of the Holy Grail locations today, ""How to use your Coconuts"" (which is hilarious), ""MPHG in Japanese"" (which is okay), ""A load of rubbish"" (which is bad), ""On location with the Pythons"" (An 18-minute documentary made in 1974 by BBC), Terry Gilliam's original sketches, and a bunch of other stuff. Despite the subtitles and rabbits, what a deal! Thank you for taking the time to read my review and feel free to leave helpful/not helpful feedback.";Great film that has problems on a SONY player
63;76.0;4.0;5.0;-869.2558860759493;"Although I rather enjoyed the all-around silliness and just plain weirdness of the MPFC telly show, it never delivered the laughs like the troupes' first original cinematic outing did. Oh sure, I got a chortle or two from the 'Funniest Joke In The World' sketch, and especially the 'Cannibal Undertaker' bit, but for some real gut-busting moments, no previous or subsequent Python venture ever hit the mark as well as their quest for the Holy Grail. Knowing that Graham Chapman was on the sauce the whole time whilst shooting the movie made things even more entertaining!\nThen there's that one great thing about having this flick on disc: I no longer have to hang out at the local midnight cult-matinee bijou! Nevermore must I stoically suffer the Python uber-geeks' annoying verbatim reciting of entire scenes from the flick and/or TV eppies, complete with really bad attempts at Cockney brogues and worse comic timing. Please, take a hint and leave British sketch comedy to the professionals, all right? Sheesh- and just when I thought Trekkies trying to imitate the halting speech patterns of Captain Kirk set the benchmark for obnoxious geek fandom! But, at least the Pythonphiles don't throw Spam or voles at the screen, like those black-leather-teddy-&-bustier-clad (and the women are dressed strangely as well!) 'Rocky Horror' freakos do with their toast & hot dogs. Great, there's people starvin' in some third-world country somewhere, and these retro-goth wanna-bes are flingin' the heat-crisped bread & processed meat links around like they're freakin' frisbees or something!\nBut I digress. Sadly, when it came to this movie's initial distribution on DVD (A.K.A. the UN-special edition), I was caught up in the notion that it would be the only version to be put out on the digital video market. I never anticipated the Pythons throwing out a special-edition pressing, which is eventually what happened as you can plainly see. But, looking back, I really should've seen it coming. After all, 'Life Of Brian', considered the best of the MPFC flicks by most (myself excluded), went the same route- given the Criterion Collection treatment, no less! Trailers, commentary tracks, the works! Great- now I gotta shell out several more bucks to make my Python DVD collection REALLY complete! Fortunately, I managed to sell my old 'MP&HG' platter on eBay for just a little less than what I originally paid for it; that helped things out quite a bit.\nBut, enough of my tangential prattling; time for my review of the features & extras! This baby's broken down into your basic 2-disc special edition format. Disc 1 is the movie itself, along with not one, but two commentary tracks by our beloved chaps. The first one features co-directors Gilliam & Jones. Although he's from the U.S., it's fairly apparent that Gilliam's stay in the British Isles has affected his vocabulary & accent a bit. During his discussion about the people going to theatres to see MP&HG, he referred to the lines of moviegoers as a queue (I think that's how it's spelled... it's pronounced 'cue') of moviegoers. Both he and Jones discuss the highs & lows of producing & filming the movie, including the revelation that much of MP&HG was financed by members of Pink Floyd, the Beatles, and other British pop/rock groups. Then there's the other three surviving Pythons droning on and basically wigging out on the secondary commentary track.\nThen there's disc 2, which features just about every imaginable extra you can... um... imagine. There's the 45-minute retrospective documentary where Jones & Palin revisit the various locations that were used to film the flick. Much of it was shot at one particular Scottish castle; the rest of it around various parts of the Scottish countryside. One of my fave extras are the sample segments dubbed in Japanese, with their English translations in subtitles. Now you can see King Arthur & Co. begin their quest for the holy sake cup, and complete the Knights Who Say 'Ni!'s demand to find them a bonsai! Hmm... methinks something got lost in the translation...\nThere's also pics of various promotional posters, bills, and the like. Then there's the two theatrical trailers that are, sadly, pretty much the same... 'cept different. Also included are bunches of other things- singalongs, behind-the-scenes photos, Gilliam's concept sketches, and much more that I can't really list in too much detail 'cuz I'd go over my 1000-word allotment for this review if I did! Of course, if I removed my previous rant concerning Rocky Horror fans, that'd likely free up enough word space to continue my recap of this DVD's extras. I mean, it was rather mean-spirited, wasn't it? Then of course there were my snide remarks about naive Ebay bidders. So maybe I should-- naaahhh...\nThe whole deal even includes a semi-rigid mylar slipcover for the snap case! Unfortunately, the mylar apparently isn't very durable- I had to exchange this set twice because the slipcover got cracked in transit both times! It made for a frustrating demonstration of the hazards of purchasing things online. Fortunately, in this case the third time was indeed the charm. The slipcover also has a lenticular finish- you know, like those trading cards where there's two separate pictures on the same card. You look at it from one angle, there's one image. Then when you turn it a bit, another picture appears. Except in this case, there's no different images; it's just put on there to make the slipcover shiny & stuff. What a gyp!\n'Late";Killer bunnies, kniggits, shrubberies, flesh wounds, and Ni!
68;77.0;5.0;5.0;-190.38756653992394;If you talk to fans of comedy, specifically the British troupe known as Monty Python, they will invariably say that The Holy Grail is just that... the Holy Grail of comedic movies.  It takes a story that virtually everyone knows at least something about, mixes in physical humor with intellectual humor, and ends up making you laugh while making fun of just about everything that most people would normally consider sarcosanct (namely, religion and history).\nThis movie is stupid, yes, but it is stupid in such a brilliantly written way that it will leave you laughing for hours after you've finished watching it.  It pokes fun at everything, with religion and history at its heart.  Many of the themes in fact are loosely veiled so as to make fun of our modern problems in a very indirect way so that you don't even realize what you were laughing at until hours or days later after some introspection.  The physical slapstick and the indirect satire (such as the scene of the Holy Hand Grenade - a classic that pokes fun at religion while seeming to embrace it) are melded perfectly in a way that only Monty Python can do it.\nThe Special Edition is a vast improvement over the previous version, giving us a new anamorphic widescreen transfer, better sound, and some special features to boot.  If you are even remotely interested in laughing, then laugh at religion, history, and everyone else along with our favorite British boys of the age before political correctness.

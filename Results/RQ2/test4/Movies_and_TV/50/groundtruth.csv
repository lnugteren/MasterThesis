1;1.0;5.0;14.0;-77.53401273885346;In my opinion, this is the best of the three DVD versions, and certainly the most faithful to the book. I find all the characters well portrayed with the exception, perhaps, of Lady Bertram who I'd have preferred to appear more placid than die-away. Fanny is humble but true to her principles. Aunt Norris is irritatingly officious and her role in the misfortunes of the Bertram sisters receives its due.  Sir Thomas is sensible and more sympathetic than in other adaptations, and his silent exasperation with Aunt Norris is a delight to behold. Henry Crawford is polished but shallow and Edmund believable as a serious young man temporarily blinded by infatuation. Fanny's banishment to her parent's home in Portsmouth is given proper attention and the contrast between the life there and at Mansfield Park made very clear.  All in all it's a delightful production and one to be enjoyed over and over again.;A fine interpretation
36;2.0;5.0;122.0;-67.55884615384612;It is very true to the storyline, which is something I really appreciated!  This movie is more suited to those who love Jane Austen's Fanny Price just the way she is, which, is a very morally upright person, who will not be persuaded against her better judgement. This story proves that simply because a person comes from a wealthy background, they dress right, they speak correctly, and they look good, this does not make them a virtuous and upright individual. Some people will not like this movie based on the fact that it does not appeal visually.  Please look beyond the fact that the actors are not glamorous.  This is a great movie and should be placed in it's rightful place next to Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Sense and Sensibility, and Persuasion.  The actors capture the qualities that Jane Austen created for her characters. This movie is for the fan of everything Jane Austen.;Outstanding adaptation of Mansfield Park.
35;3.0;5.0;108.0;-127.94666666666663;"This version of Mansfield Park is worth 5 stars to me, but it will not appeal to everyone. For it is not a glossy big-screen-adaption which trades Jane Austen's genius for something else. I saw it on television during a Jane Austen marathon about 5 years ago, and have been hoping to find this video ever since. At first I was not impressed, but I kept watching it because I am such a Jane Austen fan. Gradually I became hooked. All the actors looked so real. The actress who plays Fanny Price is especially interesting. She is not movie star beautiful, but she has the eyes and complexion of a nineteeth century doll. She uses her looks to portray the Fanny I imagined; the Fanny who is the antithesis of Elizabeth Bennet. On the other hand, the actress who plays Mary Crawford is beautiful but her looks are almost spoiled by the awful (yet historically accurate) wig she is made to wear. More importantly, her Mary Crawford is true to Austen, and with my modern sensibilities, I liked her very much. The other actors are also adept. I am very much looking forward to owning this video. I know I will watch it again and again, just as I read the book again and again.";It's worth 5 stars to me...
34;4.0;5.0;93.0;-37.717625899280534;Contrary to the other reviewers, I find this version of Mansfield Park is exactly how I imagined it when I read it. I wonder what the others were expecting in a poor girl at the mercy of difficult relatives? And, did they expect it to be more romantic? I found the acting to be exactly what I'd expect for people of the type Jane Austen described in her book. Especially in England at that time. This is not a happy book, by and large. Perhaps the readers imposed their own world onto Ms. Austen's prose when they read it. Perhaps they are not aware of the difficulties of daily life, even for the leisure class, at that time. I've watched it many times, and showed it to my friends and sisters, and we all love it!;Just the way I imagined it!
29;5.0;5.0;64.0;-24.81666666666662;I think that someone who hasn't read Mansfield Park is going to be bored by this production.  And some that have read it, too.  But if you have the time to invest, I think that this is about as faithful a rendition as we are likely to get.\nMansfield Park is my least favorite of Jane Austen's novels, partly because Fanny Price isn't the same kind of heroine that you find in P&P, S&S, or Emma.  So - a producer could make a video with an exciting Fanny Price, but then you wouldn't have Mansfield Park.\nI give it 5 stars because I believe this video does the best possible job with a complex plot, and because I believe that the actors were apt for the roles they were given.;Faithful to the book - but slow, also like the book
23;6.0;3.0;50.0;-152.83419999999995;"This production is notable for its faithfulness to the novel.  However, its main strength is also its main handicap, resulting in a production that adheres so strictly to the book that it feels drawn-out and slow at points.  The exception to this is the end scene, which wraps up the story too quickly.\n\nLike the other ""early"" BBC Austen productions, there are occasional swerves into silliness that aren't intentional and can be distracting.  Sylvestra Le Touzel, as Fanny, emphasizes her speeches with odd hand gestures.  Mr. Crawford looks like a bipedal mouse in pants, and his sister, Mary, who is supposed to be so lovely, looks about the same except in a bad `80's wig and a dress.  I giggle just thinking about Mr. Yeats's wig.\n\nStill, there are some good points.  On the balance I liked Le Touzel as Fanny, and Alison Fiske did very well as Mrs. Price.  Angela Pleasence's Aunt Bertram reminded me an awful lot of Jessica Tate from SOAP, but I still liked her very much.  The costumes and sets are fine but not remarkable, and the sound for the outdoor scenes is mediocre to poor.\n\nOn the whole, I'd say that this is a solid, but not great production.  It's not a bad choice, but don't expect it to be as attractive or interesting as other, more recent Austen productions such as A&E's Pride and Prejudice or 1995's Sense and Sensibility.";Not Bad
45;7.0;4.0;47.0;-204.82839857651243;Though not my favorite Austen, I have watched this movie again and again and I appreciate it more with each viewing. The characters are excellently portrayed and believable within the context of the mores and manners of  Jane Austen's era.  Robert Burbage was masterful in the role of Henry  Crawford. His attraction to Fanny Price was an appeal to what was still  fine and honorable in his dissipated soul, perhaps his last chance to  redeem himself. Her refusal, though perfectly understandable even if her  heart were at liberty, sealed his reckless fate.  Fanny Price, played  by Sylvestra Le Touzel, grows from a shy, repressed, vacant-eyed girl into  a young woman of firm mind and stellar character. In the end she gets what  she well-deserves - the honest and upstanding Edmund Bertram, the man she  loves. Perhaps she overplays her part. Her expressions and gestures are  rather off-puting at first but, with patience and exposure, you will grow  to appreciate her.  The wordly and witty Miss Mary Crawford ( Jackie  Smith-Wood) is a perfect foil for Fanny's innocence and delicacy. A rival  for Edmund's heart, she prevails until he discovers her true character and  compares it to that of his cousin and dearest friend Fanny Price. Like her  brother she is forsaken at last in favor of real goodness and decency.  The supporting cast, especially Anna Massey and Bernard Hepton, are  wonderful and a delight to watch. I recommend this film to all avid Austen  fans. Please take into consideration, however, that BBC productions often  appear more like stage-plays than your typical American movie productions  and the action tends to be slower and more elaborate than you may be used  to.;Subtle and character-driven, Manfield Park is a BBC gem.
41;8.0;2.0;41.0;-173.54507874015746;"This is a stylish, well-costumed, and soulless version of a great book. It left me absolutely cold. It looks like one wooden stage set after another, with acting to match. If Austen's Fanny Price is irritating, Sylvestra  LeTouzel makes her positively infuriating -- whining, complaining,  sanctimonious -- what could Edmund or anyone else see in this person?\n\nThe  only memorable performance is by Jackie Smith-Wood as Mary Crawford, who brings out all her superficial charm, her shallowness, and, finally, her  amorality. In this movie, she comes off as a much more sympathetic  character than Fanny. Henry Crawford seems like a dressed-up fashion plate  reciting his lines. The movie stayed fairly close to the book, but the  ending in the movie seems more of an afterthought, tacked on in a few lines of narration.\n\nThe definitive movie version of Mansfield Park is yet to be written. The movie currently showing bills itself as a 'wicked comedy',  and Jane Austen never intended Mansfield Park to be read as a comedy. And while Frances O'Connor is a delight in the current movie and a much better  actress than LeTouzel, her Fanny Price isn't Austen's; O'Connor's Fanny is  strong, spirited, animated, nothing like the weak, spineless Fanny of the  book. I hope someone makes a movie version of Mansfield Park that is worthy  of the book and soon, because it's one of the best novels in the English  language and deserves a version that finally does it justice.\n\nJudy Lind";Will someone please make a REAL movie of Mansfield Park?
22;9.0;4.0;22.0;-416.3668897637795;"For my money, this is the best, most accurate dramatization of a Jane Austen novel.\n\nWhy?\n\n- The dramatizers based it heavily on the book. Much of the dialogue is taken straight out of MP, and very few liberties are taken with incident or language.\n\n- Where dialoge HAS been added, it is well-written and consistent with what Miss Austen wrote, and with the characters of the story.\n\n- It unfurls itself at a slow pace, almost as if you were reading the novel. For some this might be tedious--but if you don't like this production, you probably won't like the MP the Novel, either.\n\n- Sylvestra Le Touzel does a nice job of bringing Fanny Price to life. I felt that the little eccentricities that she added (the ""chopping"" that one reviewer referred to, starts & shrieks, and even that hysterical bout of crying in the East Room) were a believable part of those ""awkwardnesses that were...as good as graces"" that Austen describes in her. They show a repressed 18 year old girl in an uncomfortable social situation, muddling through. I thought she made Fanny likeable and believeable.\n\n- Robin Langford IS Mr. Yates! It's worth the price of the DVD just to hear him say ""theatre"".\n\nBest characterizations are Edmund, Sir Thomas, Tom Bertram,  and Mrs. Norris. While the latter is certainly more strident in the novel, it's easier to understand Sir Thomas' keeping her around when her poisoned barbs are delivered with a veneer of pleasantness.\n\nLess ideal is Lady Bertram. While anyone who has read the novel might interpret her strange, slow speech as Langour, to someone who hasn't she might well come across as mentally ill. However, she is funny, if you can get past the mannerisms.\n\nI was disappointed with the Crawfords, though. The actress who played Mary Crawford is very good, but doesn't look the part. And that dark wig is very distracting. I would rather see her natural color. The black hair is too obviously wrong for her complexion.\n\nThe actor playing Henry Crawford looks far too young for the part, and doesn't have the mature confidence and subtlety that Henry Crawford exudes in the book. He looks like he's trying too hard to be seductive, and about as much of a threat to Maria Bertram as a high school boy coming on to his teacher. Conversely, the actor who plays William Price looks too old for the part, trying to act young. In those scenes where he's hugging Fanny, I kept thinking, ""Get your hands off her!"" I wonder if the drama would have been better if they had switched the two--had Robert Burbage play William Price and Allan Hendrick play Henry Crawford.\n\nNEVERTHELESS, I think anyone who appreciates Jane Austen ought to at least see this lovingly done version of Mansfield Park. It's a relic of the good old days of BBC production--intelligent, authentic, and skillfully acted.";Letting Austen be Austen
27;10.0;4.0;23.0;-49.44026845637582;I have read all the reviews and I just can't believe what people have written. This was a great movie. Yes it had terrible cinematography and the clothing was not that eye-catching but it was extremely well-written and I found the acting more than tolerable. I didn't have a problem with Sylvestra's portrayal of Fanny. I thought she did a good job even if she was not handsome. Fanny was not supposed to be a great beauty. I love the actor who played Edmund. He made me fall head over heels in love with the character. I think the storyline adhered well to the book. I also liked the portrayals of Fanny's uncle and Mary Crawford even though I despised the character. The ending I will admit was disappointing. After a long movie it was not enough of a payoff. Otherwise, this is highly recommended.;Are we watching the same movie?
2;11.0;5.0;7.0;-71.60662420382162;I really like this version of MANSFIELD PARK and am particularly impressed with some of the performances, especially those of Fanny, the Bertram brothers (when young and when adults) and Sir Thomas.  The dialogue stays very close to that of the book, with progression of the story frequently handled in letters which are read aloud as either written or received.  It seems difficult to create a sympathetic and understandable Fanny Price for the screen, as she is a quiet character, but I think Sylvestra Le Touzel was brilliant in the role.  The character who deviated most from the book was Mr. Price, but I found the changes entertaining.  When I see reviews with few stars, I wonder if the reason has to do with the viewer's unfamiliarity with the novel.  This is possibly my favorite Jane Austen story, and this depiction satisfied me.  Regency clothes and hairstyles are frequently ugly, but that can't be helped.;Very satisfying for a lover of the novel
32;12.0;4.0;24.0;-118.88800970873783;"This BBC miniseries is far truer to the book than the recent film from Miramax staring Embeth Davidtz.  I suppose, unhappy with Fanny, the screenplay writer, Patricial Rozema, rewrote the main character to reflect Jane Austen, which simply is hard to swallow.  However in this version (BBC) the script is close to the character and point of the book, the only thing lacking is the acting, the cast simply seems to have missed the characters at points.  The actress who plays Fanny, Sylvestra De Touzel, looks like a china doll through out much of the film and seems insipid (but many readers find Fanny insipid as it is); however, the finial scene does her credit.  If you are a sympathizer with the Crawfords from the book, this is a very good adaptation since Robert Burbage and Jackie Smith-Wood do the best acting in the film, if you can over look their terrible wigs.  I also find Mrs. Norris to be particularly well acted and interpreted.  I agree that this novel could do with a similar adaptation as Pride and Prejudice wonderfully received in 1995 by A&E/BBC in 1995 - but in comparison to the major motion picture this miniseries is far preferable to Austen enthusiasts.";True to book, but not to spirit
28;13.0;1.0;21.0;33.48830985915495;This adaptation is true to the text but that is its only credit.\nThe actors are not well cast for the roles they play, i.e Edmund Bertram is in his early twenties in the book!

3;14.0;2.0;9.0;-286.02649595687325;"This 1980's version of ""Mansfield Park"" is much truer to the novel than either the 1999 movie or the 2007 TV adaptation of the same name.  Unfortunately, this doesn't mean it's any better. It's just bad in its own, odd way.\n\nThe most jarring element in this production is Sylvestra Le Touzel's portrayal of Fanny Price. Le Touzel, looking like a Victorian doll or a DW Griffith star, acts as if Fanny just escaped from a mental ward--or should be in one. Throughout the series she makes strange little slashes with her hands whenever she talks.  I think this is supposed to show her earnestness, but instead it starts to look as if she's practicing some bizarre sort of kung fu or as if she's patting an invisible dog.\n\n Austen's Fanny Price is gentle, repressed, but upright. Instead, Le Touzel alternates between cold blankness, hysteria (she becomes so shrill and gibbering during her scene with Sir Thomas I ended up fastforwarding the scene), and abruptly shouted ""No's"", making it impossible to understand why so many characters find her endearing. She is both erratic and insufferable. (Le Touzel later redeemed herself as the comic, clothes-minded Mrs. Allen in ""Northanger Abbey"").\n\nMost of the other characters, with the exception of Angela Pleasence's deranged Lady Bertram, are well done. Cinematic Mary Crawfords have always fared better than cinematic Fanny Prices, and Jackie Smith-Wood brings wit and warmth to the role.  Bernard Hepton gives Sir Thomas the right amount of gravitas and graciousness. Nicholas Farrell, a longtime favorite, is also very good as Edmund Bertram, despite that character's occasional pomposity.\n\nIn staying scrupulously faithful to the novel, the script includes virtually all the novel's dialogue, to the detriment of pacing and plot. It PLODS until two thirds of the way through, when it suddenly picks up speed and interest, to the point of cramming in too many events and resolutions all at once.\n\nLike so many other reviewers, I am still hoping for a ""Mansfield Park"" that stays true to Austen's characters while streamlining the story and mining all the humor that exists within the text.";Only for the Die-Hardiest of Jane Austen fans
18;15.0;5.0;16.0;-16.945204081632625;A wonderful, understated, intelligent and sensitive performance by the lead actress anchors this adaptation of probably the most difficult of Jane Austen's books. While the later movie version throws out Austen's Fanny Price and replaces her with a more palatable Lizzie Bennett clone, this version sticks to the inflexibly good, faithful and genuinely grateful Fanny -- a girl who may appear to modern eyes to be a bit of a prig. It's tough going to make this difficult heroine likable, but Sylvestra Le Touzel more than pulls it off. Bravo. Well worth watching. Again and again.;One of the best -- and most accurate to the spirit of the original -- of the Austen adaptations
37;16.0;5.0;19.0;10.99430379746839;But certainly for the connoisseur!

24;17.0;4.0;15.0;-135.26704225352108;"The 1983 BBC miniseries of MANSFIELD PARK, adapted from the Jane Austen novel by Ken Taylor, is a highly-entertaining screen version of Austen's most pragmatic and emotional work.  Fanny Price (Sylvestra Le Touzel) is sent to live with her rich relations the Bertrams' at Mansfield Park.  Unappreciated and made to feel inferior by all except her kind cousin Edmund (Nicholas Farrell), Fanny's lot is that of a glorified servant-girl. Faced with a marriage proposal from the most unwanted of admirers, her plight seems quite hopeless, until the day when Edmund reveals his love for her.  A strong cast including Anna Massey, Angela Pleasence, Bernard Hepton and Samantha Bond, make this MANSFIELD PARK an utter joy from beginning to end.\n\nSylvestra Le Touzel, with her elegant and understated beauty, looks as though she has stepped out of a painting of the era; and is in my opinion the very embodiment of Fanny.  Likewise Nicholas Farrell gives Edmund the humanity and heart that sets him apart from his cold relatives.  The adaptation by Ken Taylor (six 50-minute episodes) allows the full arc of Austen's story to play out with ease.  Lavish production values, beautiful costumes and a lilting theme tune mark this as one of the BBC's best literary adaptations.";an excellent (and very faithful) adaptation

6;19.0;3.0;8.0;-361.9744622425629;"As yet another admitted Austen-o-phile, I can only join the ranks of other reviewers in echoing their plea for a Mansefield Park which is both engaging AND faithful to the novel.  Has not happened yet.\n  Fanny Price is meant to be a sweet-natured girl of quiet strength and intellect who remains steadfast and true whilst slogging through a storm of snubs, wrongs,temptations and trials.  Her saintly cousin Edmund is a kindred spirit; it is only right (despite the ""ick"" factor of cousins marrying cousins by today's standards)that they should be together.  This production does get that part right, and although neither of the actors playing Fanny and Edmund are terribly good-looking in the traditional sense, both grow on you as the story unfolds, so I must give each of them a nod for good acting. Likewise a salute to the actors portraying Fanny's family members: drunken father, slatternly mother and quarrelsome siblings, back at the seaside hovel from which she was ""rescued"" by her snobbish aunt and uncle; her immediate family is delightfully loud and horrible and sets her off beautifully as the only sane member.\n  That said, the production looks as if it was filmed by high school students with camera equipment they cobbled together themselves; at times you can actually hear the production crew breathing and shuffling, and apparently lavalier and shotgun mics had not yet been invented.  Terrible sound quality,unsteady camera handling.  The production is indeed too long, too ""calm""--to the point of lethargy--and devoid of some of the arch commentary from Austen which might have provided the story's proper context. Some of the sets were ridiculous--background scenes look like something from a school play. The script is earnest but both over and under-done, if that makes sense.\n  Angela Pleasence stands out as giving the most bizarre performance.  Her languid-to-the-point-of-coma delivery, all breathy and drowsy and slurringly dim-witted, might convey the childish carelessness of Fanny's aunt, but it makes her difficult to understand and she seems more under the influence of some heavy narcotic than childlike.  And the actress who plays Mary, poor girl--as some other reviewers have rightly noted, what on earth were the costumers thinking?  I know something of early nineteenth century fashion, and nowhere have I ever seen a basketball-shaped disco 'fro as the coiffure of choice for stylish young women of the day.\n  All in all, not the worst production I have ever seen, and again, there were good individual performances, but the end product truly does seem like watching a familiar story through a stuffy-headed, Benadryl haze.";Jane Austen on Benadryl
9;20.0;4.0;9.0;-688.3879133858267;"My favorites of the Austen stories are actually ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""Sense and Sensibility"" either of which I will watch in film, because there is precious little they can do other than totally butcher the stories, that makes them anything but delightful to watch.  My enjoyment of a cinematic Mansfield Park, however, is greatly dependant on its rendition, and this one is my favorite, largely because it is the most sympathetic of them.\n\nI've seen at least one version that suggests that Sir Thomas Bertram was virtually a pedophile; that really didn't go over.  It's not that it couldn't have been so--given human nature, I would be more surprised if it hadn't happened on occasion--but it's just not my Jane Austen!  More like Dickens.  In this version, Sir Thomas is a well meaning if somewhat socially bigoted person.  In his world, money equates to quality, and little Fanny Price has little to recommend her.  That he gradually grows to appreciate her good sense and to actually treat her with the affection of a real parent makes him a wonderful character, because he above all of the others actually grows by his experiences.  In fact more than any of them, he is actually aware of the experiences in the first place!\n\nThe most stellar of the characters, however, is that of Lady Bertram, played brilliantly by Angela Pleasance the daughter of the character actor Donald Pleasance.  Her languid indifference to her life captures more fully than anything else the total emptiness of her position at the top of the social ladder.  Her children are raised by others; her household is managed by others; her every decision is made for her by others.  One senses a beautiful, if perhaps mentally vacant, daughter of a modestly well off social climbing family who managed to carry off the most eligible bachelor of her generation as her prize for simply having existed; that says a lot about the society of the time and about its attitude towards the value of women.  Having had the heir and a spare as required, she retired to a sort of mental oblivion.  It is only when engaged by Fanny that she actually energizes and takes part in what goes on in her world.  Fanny bestows her full attention on Lady Bertram as though she were present and not transparent, unlike the attitude of the rest of the family.\n\nHere, too, the daughters Maria and Julia are much more sympathetic.  Maria decides to marry for money, but her alternative of marrying for love was so obviously a poor one given her selection, that one can't help but feel that her actual choice was the best one. She doesn't seem to have been an unpleasant person, simply an ill-fated one.  The outcome of Julia's marriage to Mr. Yeates was so little touched upon, that one can only hope for her happiness.  Who knows; perhaps even Maria will be happier sidelined by divorce.\n\nAunt Norris is the official ""bad guy"" of the family.  She is so obsequious to her brother-in-low, Sir Thomas, and so disparing of the young Fanny that she is obnoxious in the extreme.  The former is understandable, since she is to some extent dependant on Sir Thomas's good will; however the latter is due to her need to feel ""better than"" her neice Fanny.  She lacks anything of the real humility of her neice, and assumes all of the responsiblity for what she perceives as putting the man in her ""debt""--ie. the advantageous marriage of his daughter Maria--and eschews any responsibility for her wrong decisions--ie. her support of the theatrical activities of the younger Bertrams.  To be honest, she is a survivor in a world that leaves little margin for error in social sensitivity, and to err is to be plunged into disaster.  Still, when she is packed off to live with Maria, one can't help but feel she got her just cumupance.\n\nThe Crawford brother and sister pair are perhaps the least likeable, but then they're not supposed to be.  They are the personification of all that's objectionable about high society--or at least different from the rest of it.  They are foils for the practical good sense of Fanny, and that which throws the country cousins off the ""right path.""  They are the ""beautiful people"" of their time; spoiled, bored, ignorant of or indifferent to the realities of others' lives.\n\nA fine presentation of the story and my favorite.";My favorite Mansfield Park version

It far surpasses the 1999 version even though the costuming and settings aren't as appealing. The fact that Hollywood has not turned the novel into something is is not in this adaptation is my reasoning behind giving it 5 stars.

What the...?!\n\nI don't give 2 straws if a movie is faithful to the original if the movie is funny...when it isn't supposed to be.\n\nLet's put aside the hideous wigs (Robin Langford's Mr. Yates' hair must simply be seen to be believed), the high school play-level sound, and the entire score that seems to be performed by a lone oboe player (the producer's kid, perhaps?).  This is a low-budget enterprise and that would be fine, if not for the SIMPLY. ATROCIOUS. ACTING.\n\nI really don't want to be unkind, but I paid good money to rent this movie and therefore feel quite comfortable saying that as Fannie Price, Le Touzel's acting makes Pauly Shore's acting look positively Shakespearesque.  It was so amateurish I was fascinated and like a train wreck, couldn't look away.\n\nThe novel's Fannie was one of those goody-two-shoes that were prevalent in 19th-century literature (much like Polly Milton in Alcott's ""An Old-Fashioned Girl""), gliding through the novel with eyes lifted heavenward and hands folded in everlasting prayer, sanctimoniously condemning anything fun as sinful; well, maybe that is an exaggeration but you get the point. A real party girl, that one.\n\nMy point is, Fannie is a rather boring character whose occupation in life appears to be spoiling fun whenever she happens upon it.  In the movie, Le Touzel definitely sticks to this characterization, which again, would be fine, but she seems to feel the need to make up for her character's lackluster personality by odd little movements accompanied by wide eyes, looking for all the world like she has just been given a wedgie.\n\nAngela Pleasense as Lady Bertram is puzzling...I didn't realize potheads existed in the early 19th century.  Picture Jeff Spicoli in a powdered pompadour wig and a lace shawl...that's Lady Bertram.\n\nThis is not to say there wasn't any good acting to be found...Pug the dog was pretty good.\n\nBernard Hepton as Sir Thomas was actually quite good, but I have to imagine he was looking desperately around  during filming and wondering if he could fake his own death to get out of this situation and save his career.\n\nMy husband walked in while I was watching this and within 5 seconds, burst into laughter.  Admittedly, he is not exactly a connoisseur of British high drama, but he knows a hack job when he sees one.\n\nAll in all, if you are looking for elegant, well-done drama, look elsewhere.

It completes my collection of Austen movies, and I am very happy  that I purchased it.  It is certainly not up to A&E's Pride and  Prejudice, nor Emma, but I would rank it right up there with Sense &  Sensibility.  It is true that you must decide in advance that it is not  going to be your typical Hollywood product - here we are more dependent on  the actors than background music and cinematography to impress us and tell  their story.  Curiously, I found Fanny's hand gestures to be a natural  expression of her character.  I was left, however, with wondering why  Edmund married Fanny - but I was left pondering the same thing after  reading the book.  The movies that need to be re-done are first Persuasion  and second Northanger Abbey.;Good story, well done.

Do not buy it. I cannot believe any other version could possibly be worse than this.\nBuy the other ones. If you cant find other ones, don't bother just read the book and use your imagination.;this is so bad its almost funny
12;25.0;5.0;9.0;-172.33416988416985;"This BBC adaption of Mansfield Park faithfully follows Jane Austen's story of a quiet heroine who overcomes the odds to marry the man who has captured her heart.  Fanny Price must be a sore trial for an actress, for most scenes she must sit silent or speak just a few words.  Her body language is likewise restrained.  In this version we have a lovable Fanny who signals expressively with her eyes, indicating a depth of emotion and anguish that captures the heart.  She is supported by an able ensemble cast who are all flawless in their roles from the amiable Edmund Bertram to the evil Henry Crawford.\n\nIn Mansfield Park, Jane Austen turns her caustic eye on the situation of the ""poor relation"".  Fanny Price is the daughter of a gently born lady who married a naval officer, now sunk by alcoholism and injury to a life on shore in Portsmouth.  Fanny's mother has two sisters: Mrs. Norris who married a clergyman and Lady Bertram, wife to Sir Thomas.  These two wind up off-handedly bringing Fanny to Mansfield Park as a child where the main object is to impress upon her how inferior her status is to her cousins and how grateful she should be.  Because of this dark undertone, there is less humor in the situation, but by the same token, Fanny's eventual triumph is much larger.\n\nIf you want stars and glamor, go elsewhere, but for the money this is the best and most faithful rendering of Jane Austen's observant novel.";A Faithful and Fabulous Fanny at a fair Price!
26;26.0;2.0;11.0;-232.44468944099378;"As an avid reader of Jane Austen, I was very dissappointed in the acting.  This film, however, was extremely accurate in sticking with the book.  But, I was so dissappointed with the casting and acting, that I could barely watch 20 minutes into the film.  I was very turned off by Lady Bertram's character.  In the book, she is portrayed as 'indolent' (lazy), but very sweet, but completely wrapped up in her own little world, of whatever will cost her any exertion, or interruption of her pointless habits (ugly needlework!).  In the film, however, the actress has her coming across as more insane than anything else!  Made me insane to watch it!! (I must say, however, that she would be a very hard character to play; but the actress who attempted it never even got close!).  The next bit of bad acting (or directing, probably), was Aunt Norris.  In the book, she is spiteful, harsh, and unfeeling in all of her dealings (words and actions) with Fanny.  However, in the movie, the actress smiles through every lecture with Fanny.  This totally does not portray the real harshness of Aunt Norris... they make her seem sweet but clueless in her dealings with Fanny.  Jane Austen never portrayed her as clueless with Fanny.  In other words, she is portrayed as way too nice in the movie... I think that takes out a lot of the punch of Jane Austen's story.  I also think that the casting for the Bertram girls was way off.  Maria, in the book, is portrayed as extremely pretty, even beautiful.  The Maria in the movie was plain enough to have easily played Julia, the younger and less pretty sister, or even to have played Fanny, who the book portrays as only attaining to average 'pretty' only once she is fully grown up. Don't bother watching this film... just read the book again, and wait for something better!";Very Disappointed
17;27.0;4.0;9.0;-501.38567291311745;"Face it,no one seems to be content with ANY of the adaptations thus far on Jane Austen's MANSFIELD PARK.It is accepted that it is not her best novel,so no small wonder screenwriters keep trying to rework it in order to make it more interesting!\n\nThis 1983 BBC adaptation is unquestionably the truest to the  Austen book. Fanny Price is sent to live with her wealthy cousins,The Bertrams, at the expense of her obnoxious Aunt Norris. There, Fanny is accepted as at least a servant class relative. She encounters all of the pleasures and privileges of being in the wealthy class,but she herself is to not rise above her station in life. She has always had an endearing relationship with her cousin Edmund,and eventually love wins out and Fanny and Edmund will marry. This is not a spoiler. It is simply Jane Austen!\n\nNow...for those who crave accuracy to source material,this is simply the best and most faithful retelling of MANSFIELD PARK.Most Austen fans will at least be pleased that the novel is adhered to. Because of the 1983 time frame,and the fact that it is an early BBC production,the production design and quality is stagey and low budget. Acting is uniformly good,especially the great Anna Massey of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hotel-du-Lac-Region-2/dp/B000092WCF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hotel du Lac [Region 2</a>] who with complete abandon portrays the pernicious Aunt Norris. Her performance is the fullest and most robust,and it is this adaptation that gives HER character the full weight of the novel (if that is of importance to you).Nicholas Farrell who was just two years removed from his triumphant performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chariots-of-Fire-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0006HBLUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chariots of Fire (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;is exquisite as Edmund and again is given full latitude to flesh out his character.\nOn the other hand,the interpretation of Mrs. Bertram from Angela Pleasance is UNIQUE to say the least. NOTE: all three adaptations interpret Mrs. Bertram differently, so you may never be fully satisfied with any of them! Pleasance portrays Mrs. Bertram with an absolute breathy airheadedness that I personally found to be annoying from the moment we meet her and her dog Pug. No small wonder the woman drinks in the 1998 adaptation and is a wiley feminist in the 2008 version. There is no agreement on how this character should be brought to the screen.\nStephana Le Touzel is not a pleasant looking Fanny Price; she is rather plain and grimmacy and has odd affected hand gestures which doesn't hurt the performance, but really doesn't help it either!\nThe production value is low-budget,yet correctly ""staged"" for the time period. All of the wigs are atrocious, and the make up is  out of HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH!!!!Most of the story occurs indoors with only a few outside shots which makes for a claustrophobic experience. Also,because this tries to stay very faithful to the book, it's 4 hour length can be daunting and tedious. It is best watched broken with a rest between Parts One and Two.\nWell worth the time spent to own this DVD as the other adaptations will undoubtedly be aided in the filling in the blanks as they are shorter in length. For faithfulness and NOT necessarily enjoyment's sake, this 1983 version is your choice.";1983 BBC is closest to the novel,but not necessarily the most enjoyable

I, like many, am adverse to modern tweeking of Austin's characters and storylines and desire true-to-book scripts and casting. IF your view of Fanny is a freakishly physically akward and emotionally terrified to the point of apparent chemical imbalance, utterly unpretty sort of hermit, then you may like this version - by far the WORST actress of all the heroines cast.  Either by nature or direction or both, this actress goes from a constant dead wide eyed corpse-like stare to a few freakish over-the-top attempts at emoting - it is truly bewildering that anyone thought this womans performance skills existent. She presents as having ZERO beauty in any form - either of personality or character, which she desperately needs being the most physically strange and ackward woman ever cast in such a role. I am not saying she could not be attractive, I'm saying her presentation is so horrible it ruins any chance her strange, but possible looks may have had! I am sorry to be hard on any of our sex, but there it is - there was just no way to accept as credible the proposition that any of the men in the story could possibly find anything attractive in her. Sigh. Hence, the entire thing fell, as much as i like the line-by-line rendering of the book ... Yes, if you want to squeeze every last bit of Austin out of the viewing, you get lots of it here, but it is too slow going and as i've elaborated, Fanny is just intolerable at imp times, which is to say, the climatic scenes in which when she really needs to act.;painful to watch

If not, the story may seem boring and dragging, but the book itself read that way, at least the first time around.\n\nI highly commend this version above all others.  It taught me to appreciate the book and read it anew.;The Best Available Adaption
5;32.0;5.0;5.0;-290.82630434782607;"I checked this 1986 BBC six-part series of ""Mansfield Park"" out of the library and absolutely loved it. I think that some of the 1980s BBC productions (including ""Pride and Prejudice"") number among its best, and this production certainly serves as an example. Despite the (understandably, given its age) shop-worn appearance of the print, the costumes and settings glitter with elegance.\n\nThe actors are as good as is to be expected in a BBC series. The only character I thought was unreal was Angela Pleasance, whose Lady Bertram was so 'out of it' that she suggested that Her Ladyship's problem was an addiction to laudanum. However, I liked Anna Massey's caustic interpretation of Aunt Norris, a thoroughly unlikable character, whose constant belittling of poor relation Fanny Price has caused that young woman to become self-effacing with feelings of unworthiness among the splendid surroundings of her 'betters'. Ms Le Touzel portrays Fanny with such repression that at times one would like to shake her. In contrast to Fanny's diffidence, Mary Crawford, the vicar's sister-in-law, sparkles with wit, and emerges as a 'modern' character, who might be a heroine in the twenty-first century, but, since she has a mind of her own, is thoroughly out of place in the early nineteenth!\n\nFanny's character becomes understandable and sympathetic when, after seven years, she goes home to her family in Portsmouth, and she realises the contrast between life in cramped quarters with her over-worked, disorganised mother and her drunken father, and life in solitary elegance at Mansfield Park. Her endurance of her rather second-best existence at Mansfield allows her to endure her six weeks at Portsmouth where she is equally unappreciated. We are happy when rescue comes in the form of a recall to the Park, and she takes her sister with her to partake in what will be a satisfying Jane Austen future.\n\nYou know you're watching a good series based on a Jane Austin novel when, even though absolutely nothing of importance happens for 266 minutes, you love every one of them and don't want it to end.\n\nI watched all six episodes of this series at one sitting.";An Enjoyable Day at the Park
20;33.0;3.0;8.0;-587.6064540059346;"I expected much more from this BBC production of a Jane Austin novel but I still found a lot to enjoy.  It was very slow and after so much suffering, the happy ending came much too quickly.\n\nMy main problem was with the acting.  I am a huge fan of British actors and this was the first time I was bothered by any of their performances.  I don't know if it was the fault of the individuals, actually, or that of the director.  The main example is that of Aunt Bertram, a frail woman who spends most of her time on the couch hugging her dog.  I don't know how Jane Austen wrote her but I doubt that it was as close to ""insane"" as this actress portrayed her. (Think Blanche duBois from A Streetcar Named Desire.)  Her speech and behavior was so strange as to seem bizarre and it didn't further the plot; it called attention to itself and was distracting.  It was also hard to hear her words and I would have appreciated subtitles.\n\nThe other really over-the-top performance was that of Fanny's father,  a rip-roaring drunk that would have gotten gold stars in an acting class, but here, again, it just stuck out like a sore thumb.  Likewise his makeup---he sported the reddest nose this side of Ronald MacDonald, and again, it was so surprising, that it detracted from the story.  It was also highly unbelievable that his wife was so healthy and beautiful after all those years with such a drunken slob, (who brags that he believes in wife beating) and with all those wild kids!\n\nI thought that Fanny was well cast but the actress engaged in some physical mannerisms that were off-putting, mostly the way she tensed up her arms and chopped them in the air whenever she was upset, which was frequently. True, she was supposed to be an awkward teenager but again, it called attention to itself.  This is something any good director could have remedied.  Other than that, she had the requisite air of reticence and unfailing virtue that the part required.  I liked the way she looked; her lack of obvious beauty made her more interesting than prettier women, especially in the few scenes where she did show some color.\n\nEdmund was equally well-cast.  He was very believable as the future parson who was entranced by the more sophisticated and beautiful Mary Crawford, but who eventurally comes to his senses.  He looked right, too--not quite handsome with that huge nose, but still with a sort of nobility that shone through his extreme features.\n\nThe actress who plays Mary Crawford was very good, I thought, portraying a complex woman who had some genuine goodness in her, but was undone by her own love of glamour and money.  Yes, her wig was awful, but so was the wig of Lord Bertram...(who did these wigs?)  Her brother who was supposed to be a big lady killer was badly cast.  The actor did a good enough job but he was so physically unattractive that he was never convincing. Sir Thomas Bertram was well done, humane and charming and stern when necessary..very much the Lord of the Manor.\n\nI have one complaint about the packaging of the DVD.  It features Fanny and Edmund, holding hands, so I knew, before I opened the box how it was going to end.  This really spoiled any surprise for me.\n\nHowever the story was still basically a good one and there is plenty of visual enjoyment.  There is a certain magic in these BBC adaptations of the classics that still came across here, in spite of its flaws.  Maybe it's just seeing the splendor of a lost era - the great houses, the costumes, the lush rose gardens, the immaculate horse carriages.  Maybe it's the glimpse into the mind of a great moralist, Jane Austin, for whom virtue always wins over vice!  For that alone, it's worth watching.";Not quite up to snuff - but still enjoyable

7;36.0;5.0;5.0;2.0954545454545865;There are some films, usually interpretations of great literature, that are as fresh as the day they were released. Mansfield Park (BBC 1986)is one of them and joins the ranks of  Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet (1966) and the BBC's Pride and Prejudice (Colin Firth 1994). The casting, setting, screen play and the interpretation of Jane Austen's great art could not be improved. As the NYTimes' critic said of the just mentioned Pride and Prejudice, it almost bested the book.  I don't know anyone who has seen the film who disagrees with this estimation.;Flawless interpretation of Jane Austen's Mansfield Park

With that said, let me assure you that while this version of Mansfield Park is certainly faithful to the novel, it is  absolutely soulless, dry, and painful to watch.\nThe ""acting""  (and I hesitate to call it that) is terrible. ""Lady Bertram"" is  particularly terrible - she has affected a whiny voice and unblinking eyes  as a substitute for acting; she appears drugged. ""Fanny"" is a tad  better, and I didn't find her chopping hand-motions as distracting as some  other reviewers.\nThis cannot in anyway compare with A&E's  magnificent, glowing version of Pride & Prejudice. Mansfield Park is a  captivating story and should be done justice to.\nMy advice is to save  your money; the bad lighting, the hideous cinematography and lackluster  costuming make this production a true nightmare. However, if you are truly  desperate to watch a Jane Austen novel brought to life, try the 1970's  version of Persuasion.

The actress that played Fanny Price wasn't bad looking, except for a strong jaw, but what bothered me more was her posture throughout the film. It made me cringe, it looked so uncomfortable, and I thought she looked much like a robot during the whole of it. I don't think the film dwelled on her feelings enough. The events and other characters like Miss Crawford took up most of the film, and when Fanny finally showed emotion in crying, this scene was very strange because she was almost screaming.\n\n  I thought Mr. Crawford looked like a freak, and his sister looked like his identical twin. I couldn't figure out why Edmund would like Mrs. Crawford more than Fanny, except she had better posture and more comfortable manners.\n\n  The ending seemed abrupt and rather disappointing, not very romantic. The movie didn't really show why Edmund's feelings suddenly changed toward Fanny, and with so much footage of every other event, couldn't they have show their wedding?\n\n  It is, however, a collector's item, and useful if one is desperate to see the novel on screen.;Interesting, definitely not romantic

While they in no way rival the beauty of the actors of the big-money Hollywood productions of Mme. Austen's other works, these actors perform quite admirably in this film.  Sylvestra Le Touzel (""Fanny"") is entirely believable as she morphs from a mousy miss to a capable, self-possessed young woman -- although she overemotes on more than one occasion.  (I understand that Fanny's eyes ""speak"" for her emotions, but really! They ""bug out"" in surprise so often, she looks like her aunt's dog, ""Pug,"" much of the time.)  Angela Pleasance overdoes it a bit as spacey, childlike Aunt Bertram; but otherwise, this film is well worth the investment of time it takes to view the entire 6 episodes.

This is not  a modern politicized, feminized, de-Christianized (or romanticized)  distortion of Austen's art!  No doubt the cinematography is not up to  current big-budget Hollywood standards, but I really cannot fault the  acting.  LeTourzel is excellent, for example, in the crucial scene in which  Fanny resists the pressure of Sir Thomas to accept Mr. Crawford.  Hepton  (Sir Thomas), Burbage (Henry Crawford), Smith-Wood (Mary Crawford) are also  excellent, as are the characters of Maria, Julia and Aunt .  If you want  fast-paced action, this is definitely not the film for you.  But most  people who really appreciate Austen's book, will also treasure this BBC  gem.;A Faithful Austen Adaptation

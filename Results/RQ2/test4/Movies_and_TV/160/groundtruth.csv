104;1.0;5.0;847.0;-500.44122837370236;"Jane Austen wrote PERSUASION towards the end of her life, while in her final illness. Thus an atmosphere of bending weariness and quiet resignation pervades this tender romance, infused within provincial life in Regency England, swaying against the backdrop of the Napoleonic wars. I could not help but love this BBC film version unconditionally, so deftly are the gentle qualities of the novel brought forth.\nAs with her earlier novel, MANSFIELD PARK, Austen filled this story with subdued satire - intertwining a comedy of genteel manners with the unassailable decrees of the human heart. This is the story of Anne Elliot (Amanda Root): a single woman in her late 20's who, eight years previous, on the counsel of her patroness and late mother's friend, Lady Russell (Susan Fleetwood-who sadly died of cancer shortly after this film was made), had refused an offer of marriage from her true love, Captain Frederick Wentworth (Ciaran Hinds) on the grounds of his poor financial prospects.\nCaptain Wentworth returns to Anne's rather confined realm of society when his sister, Mrs. Croft, and her husband, an Admiral in the Navy (John Woodvine, of 1992's WUTHERING HEIGHTS) lease Anne's baronet father's estate, Kellynch Hall. Before she can join her father and elder sister Elizabeth (Phoebe Nicholls) in Bath, she must first spend a few weeks with her hypochondriac younger sister Mary, whose husband Charles' family, the Musgroves - parents Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove, and two younger sisters, Henrietta and Louisa - reside nearby. It is here that Anne becomes re-acquainted with her long-lost love, who's by now an advantageous match for any young woman, having made his prize fortune during the war. Wentworth initially fancies himself ""a lost man"" to the first attractive young lady who bestows upon him her ""compliments to the Navy."" To all appearances, Louisa Musgrove is that very lady...\nAmanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, even though they lack the physical beauty distinctive in other Austen adaptations, express the gamut of suppressed emotions most flawlessly here. Ms. Root conjures all the feelings of empathy and affection with every delicate expression she makes. Mr. Hinds, whom I've seen in a number of other roles -including that of an overwrought Mr. Rochester in a 1997 adaptation of JANE EYRE - gives here what's quite likely the best performance of his career. His Wentworth's subtle yet barely suppressed anger hits Anne like a bombshell. The emotion is slow paced and very flowing - but it's nonetheless quite palpable.\nThe entire cast, in fact, gives every cause for high praise -- most notably Corin Redgrave (brother of Lynn and Vanessa) as Anne's vain and spendthrift father, Sir Walter Elliot, Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma Thompson) as Anne's self-centered younger sister Mary Musgrove, and Fiona Shaw (Mrs. Reed in 1996's JANE EYRE) as the indomitable Mrs. Croft - each are absolutely perfect in their respective roles.\n\nMany a time, upon a weekend afternoon, I've placed this tape into my VCR and played it while occupied with various household chores. As ever and as always, this film offers up its many beauties, and they never fail to enchant me: the long walks through the pristine and stately New Forest - the excursions with the Navel men striding proudly along jetties of the shores at Lyme - the atmospheric turns about the drizzly sidewalks, the pump rooms, and the concert halls of Bath. Such are the scenes that eternally soothe a spirit ~";"""-Loving Longest When All Hope Is Gone-"""
1;2.0;5.0;6.0;-115.60384615384613;"Anyone (except the most hard-boiled of folks) who is mystified by Jane Austen's continued popularity is best answered by watching this film. Her understanding of human behavior has never been better or more amusingly illustrated than here - in the scenes which contrast the goodwill, good sense, steadiness and love for life of some characters with others who have fewer or none of those qualities. The satire in regards to human flaws like pomposity is perfectly done. This is also my favorite ending of all the romantic films I've ever seen - it's actually a four-part ending beginning with the climatic letter scene, the other three following in gentle waves - alone at last, and walking away from the crowd; the card party in which we see two completely happy people impervious to any further criticism or interference; and most wonderful is the final scene which portrays not an end, but the beginning of a shared adventure. That's what any successful couple I've ever known was doing: partnering in a shared adventure. (Most of us won't go seafaring, but isn't rearing children the greatest adventure that most of us do experience?)";Magnificent (spoiler alert)
98;3.0;3.0;171.0;-485.4749999999999;"My copy of the novel ""Persuasion"" refers to it as having an ""autumnal"" tone, which has definitely carried over into this adaptation. It makes no pretensions to being another ""Pride and Prejudice,"" or ""Sense and Sensibility"", lacking those books' underlying theme of warm friendship between sisters. Nor is it like ""Emma"" or ""Northanger Abbey,"" both comedies featuring immature women and their self-discovery. In other words, ""Persuasion"" may be a disappointment to those who passionately love one of those other stories, and expect the same thing. This is ironic, considering that some believe ""Persuasion"" was based on an incident in Jane Austen's real life, where she apparently turned away a suitor in her youth, and later regretted it.\nAgain - the ""autumnal"" tone is picked up by the two leads, who are older and less conventionally attractive than, say, Kate Beckingsdale or Jeremy Northam. Ciaran Hinds has a quiet charisma that grows the longer you watch him, and has developed into a viable leading man. Amanda Root begins the film as a grey little mouse and transforms into a more lovely woman halfway through, solely through her skill as an actress, and not through a film of vasoline smeared on the camera.\nThose who complain that Root is not pretty enough to fit their mental image are missing the point, and probably did not read the book, where Austen points out that Anne's beauty had faded with age. (As we read on, we realize that it's her love for life that's dimmed, which in turn has affected her attractiveness to others. Her handsome father certainly becomes less good-looking each time his prissy behavior is described.)\nIn the film, it would be easy to pull a ""Grease""-like transformation - where, like Olivia Newton John, Amanda Root comes out all dolled up in makeup and a hot bodice, ready to jump on the Regency tilt-a-whirl. But the Captain and Anne regain their passion for another through their rediscovery of each other's hearts, not their good looks - although seeing each other's good character instantly brightens their countenance and puts a spring in their step, making them much more attractive. Neither Hinds nor Root need a gallon of makeup to make this transformation believable.\nThe two performances that I enjoyed most, however, were that of Sophie Thompson and Fiona Shaw. Thompson, who was only vaguely boorish in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" as a woman despairing of meeting a quality mate, goes full-hog as a high maintenance mooch. Very funny.\nShaw, on the other hand, is one of the funniest things about the ""Harry Potter"" movies, as Harry's dreadful aunt. Here, she is positively vibrant as a happy naval wife. She just brims with love and vigor, believable as a woman who has travelled the seas to be with her husband, and who wishes happiness for her younger brother and all around her. Both the character and the portrayal make a fine contrast to Anne's waspish sisters and father, and the overindulgent yet loving Musgroves. Only five years older than costar Root, with what seems to be a great range, I wonder what charm Shaw might have brought to the role of Anne if she had been offered the part at an appropriate age.\nThis is a warm, and yes, subtle movie, which will chase away the blues on a winter day.";A solid adaptation of Austen's quietest novel
95;4.0;5.0;152.0;-215.54539473684204;"This movie is not only the best film adaptation of a Jane Austen novel, it's also a wonderful film in its own right.  What did I love about it?\n1) It isn't stuffy and unnatural.  The characters sound human when they speak; you can imagine that this is how people spoke in the 19th century - not like pompous orators, but like real people.  The world surrounding the characters isn't overly polished or brightly lit; again, there's a natural, ""lived-in"" feeling to all the buildings and landscapes; they do not look like they came out of a glossy postcard.\n2) The performances.  I don't have enough praise for Amanda Root, who plays Anne Elliot, a woman whose marriage prospects are slim to nil, and who has just been thrown into the company of a man whom she rejected years ago.  Root can speak volumes just with her eyes, and everything about her fits perfectly with the gentle, wry and intelligent Anne Elliot.  As Captain Wentworth, Ciaran Hinds is also great; he disappears into the character.  Both actors aren't conventionally beautiful or handsome either; Root in particular blossoms before the viewers eyes - at first she's very faded and quiet, and then we (like Wentworth) see her spirit shine out.  In addition to Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, the rest of the cast also do a wonderful job.  Perhaps because there aren't any big name actors, we can get totally immersed in the film.\n3) It's true to Austen.  There's subtle humor, real human feeling, and a keen understanding of human nature.  It's an unforgettable love story.\n4) The kiss.  One kiss - perfectly timed, perfectly executed...  you will melt.\n5) The soundtrack.  This holds true particularly for the assembly at Bath, and the Italian vocal pieces.";A gem

I sat agape in the dark theater, and was so drawn in that when the lights came up I completely forgot I had come to the theater with a friend.  This movie and story blew me away. Seriously I sat with my jaw open the whole of the movie. No popcorn, candy or ladies room break. I was transported.  Every character was so well acted and when Captain Wentworth came to ""check on the boy"" and Anne saw Fredrick for the first time in 8 years.... I'm holding my breath just thinking of how she felt.

From the sunlit kitchen tables to the birds chirping at the country estates, you will find the atmosphere and sound very realistic.\n\nThis is the story of two people seeking a second chance at happiness and almost seeming to pass by one another like two ships in the night. Neither is willing to say what they are feeling as both are still emotionally distraught from their unfortunate breakup.\n\nAnne (Amanda Root) is an angel of mercy to everyone around her. She not only provides care, she also seems to be everyone's confidante. In her eyes we see her own private torture, which she tries to hide at all costs. She feels that perhaps she made a mistake in rejecting the love of Capt. Wentworth (Ciarn Hinds), who could not provide for her financially at the time. When he appears in her life again, she fears she may lose him forever.\n\nHer own family has gone in various directions due to their own financial difficulties. She is burdened with guilt and financial worries. At first she is shy and melancholy and then when she realizes love may again be within her reach, she blossoms into a beautiful woman who knows exactly what she wants.\n\nThe temptation at the start of this movie is to just stop the tape and rewind. However, something in the story kept me watching and the conclusion was very worthwhile. The story is not complex, yet the finer details are worth following and are at times very amusing. Some of the dialogue is so wonderful you have to rewind just to listen to it again!\n\nMr. Elliot: ""Good company is always worth keeping.""\nAnne: ""My idea of good company, Mr. Elliot, is the fellowship of clever, well-informed people who have a great deal of conversation and a liberality of ideas.

4;7.0;4.0;12.0;-32.51214285714282;While it's a slow starter, it is an excellent production.  You must invest your whole attention into watching this production - it isn't as viewer-friendly as the Sue Birtwistle productions, but it is very good.  You can believe that these two people of average looks were kept apart and are somehow navigating through society's norms to find a way back together.  I love the many small touches - the way the staff refuses to look at the Baronet Eliot when he leaves his home, the physical appearance of the sailors rowing the dinghy to the ship and undergoing inspection, the cart loaded with livestock Anne must ride to her sister's home.  It's not the glamorous world we think of, but probably more realistic.;Slow But Worth the Wait
77;8.0;5.0;48.0;-504.3676530612244;"Anne Elliot, a shy, unassuming and unmarried ""old maid"" of 27, lives a quiet life in the country with her noble family, at Kellynch Hall.  That is, until the state of her family's finances (""You must retrench!"") forces them to move from their lavish home in the country, to the not-quite-so-comparable comfort of Bath, in order to rent out their home (and get themselves out of debt).  The new tenants of Kellynch Hall are Admiral & Mrs. Croft, whose brother, Fredrick Wentworth, Anne had been engaged to at the tender young age of 19.  Anne had reluctantly broken off their engagement at her family & friends' persuasion, as ""he had nothing to recommend him: no fortune, no connections"" and her spirits were said to have ""never been high, since...your disappointment.""  When Captain Fredrick Wentworth returns from 8 years at sea, with elevated social status and newly-acquired wealth, his appearance sparks a series of events in the lives of all the Elliot girls: Elizabeth, Mary & most of all Anne...\n\nWhen I saw this film as a teenager with my mom & friend at an independent theater outside Washington, D.C., I came out with a sense that this was one of the better films out there.  That this was the type of film I had been looking for all my life: a wonderfully done, well-filmed, superbly-acted ""period piece""...I must say that ""Persuasion"" was likely the start of it all for me.  ""Persuasion,"" which was then followed closely by Emma Thompson's ""Sense & Sensibility,"" had me hooked: I had been given the bait and I had fallen for it.  From that point on, I became a huge fan of period films: I have since consumed every well-known and obscure period film I could possibly get my hands on, but it all goes back to that first theatrical viewing of ""Persuasion"".\n\nThe dialog is amazing!  The subtle ways that the Elliot family persecute Anne are beyond compare: I have never again to this day, seen such a brilliant exercise in underlying snubs & barbs: slight criticisms & faint scorns from Anne's family that are never rude or direct but are always subtle and seemingly innocuous (although they often cut to the quick).  Anne takes them so well, and clearly loves her family in spite of it all.  The scenes are beautifully filmed, the costuming well-done, and the scenery breathtaking.  The scene where Anne reads the letter is so touching!  And I must say the true-to-the-period ending scenes are simply wonderful: Jane Austen would have been proud!\n\nFor those of you worried about family-friendly content: no need to worry!  There is little to object to in this film: there are very, very suble allusions to a possible liaison, so subtle that most never discover them.  There is a scene where a young lady falls and hurts herself; there is a little language: a few uses of d*mn, and little else.\n\nThis quiet, unobtrusive, slow-moving, delight of film gem is well worth any time you devote to it: when watching for the first time, I would recommend giving it your full attention and not being too tired.  It is very mellow & quiet, and may take you awhile to get into, but will be well worth the effort in the end.  ""Persuasion"" would have to be one of my favorite period pieces of all time, along with ""Pride & Prejudice"" and ""North & South.""  A definite must for any girl or woman interested in period pieces: this film is an utter delight!";Quietly unobtrusive, slow-moving, delightful gem of a film!
79;9.0;5.0;38.0;-153.0285714285714;"Other reviewers seem to see this film only as a cosy, romantic piece of escapism. I can't help but feeling that they are missing something.\n\nThis is a slow and beautiful film, which, in spite of its happy ending, has a gentle sorrow to it. Time is passing by for Anne Elliot - she's older than any other Austen heroine, and this sense of lost youth is very present in the film.\n\nThis is also one of the few films I have seen that actually captures the feeling of being in love. Anne sees Captain Wentworth passing in the street or is helped by him into a carriage - these are the small moments that can be described for a page or two in the books. Modern films tend to want more drama, but this adaptation sticks to the ""small canvas"" that Jane Austen worked with, and does so brilliantly.\n\nNothing is harder than making nice people interesting, but in this Persuasion really is a success. Amanda Root plays Anne with a lot of warmth and intelligence, and Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth is also very likeable.\n\nWatching this film left me with a little bit melancholic, but also uplifted. It seems to describes so accurately how it feels to be alive, to love and long, with both humour and wistfulness. It's more than just escapism, and deserves better attention than playing in the background as you hover your flat.";Less is more
74;10.0;5.0;36.0;-363.64932166301963;"Persuasion and Pride and Prejudice are my favorite Austen books.\n\nPersuasion is a quiet story written near the end of Austen's life.  It is about a young woman, Anne Elliot, who is persuaded to give up the man she loves because he has no means to provide for her.\n\nYears later he comes back with money and position (a Captain of the Navy) while her fortunes have lessened.  She has never gotten over him, he has never forgiven her for her rejection.\n\nThis movie does a fine job of capturing all the emotional nuances of the book.\n\nThe two leads do a marvelous job at conveying to the viewer their past history and the emotional toll it has taken upon them both.\n\nThe scene when Wentworth walks in on Mary and Anne as they are eating breakfast, the first time they've seen each other since their broken engagement, is thick with tension.  The resentment is washing off of Wentworth in waves, while Anne is almost overcome.\n\nWhile Wentworth courts Lousia, his anger to Anne is front and center.  It is as if he is saying to her ""See what you gave up? I don't need or want you anymore.""  Yet he still cares if she suffers, as the scene where he asks his sister to take her back to Uppercross illustrates.  We feel Anne's shock and his discomfort that he would care she is tired.\n\nThe pivotal scene when Harville and Anne are debating who loves longest, man or woman, is brilliant.  Both characters convey such depth of emotion yet respect for the other.\n\nThe scene where Anne reads Wentworth's declaration of love is beautiful.  The director had both actors read the letter so we hear both of their voices.  Wentworth's voice is full of frustration,passion and hope.  Anne's voice begins incredulous and evolves in to joy.\n\nThe only complaint I have is the Mrs. Smith subplot.  I wished they had left it intact, as it provides a richer texture to Anne's realization of just who Mr. Elliot really is.\n\nI appreciated the nod to Austen's original ending (which she thankfully changed to include one my favorite love letters in literature) with the inclusion of Wentworth having a comission from the Admiral to find out where Anne and Mr. Elliot plan to live after they marry.\n\nRoot is not a Hollywood beauty, but while Anne Elliot is supposed to be pretty, time and disappointment has ravaged her looks.  I thought she captured Anne perfectly.\n\nThis is my favorite screen adaptation of an Austen book. It is very true to the reflective spirit of the novel.";Fantastic
7;11.0;5.0;15.0;-234.4808832807571;The seemingly impossible has happened: I've finally found a Jane Austen adaptation I love as much as the acclaimed BBC 1985 version of Pride and Prejudice and Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility! After finishing this 1995 version of Persuasion, I was shocked to see that it was only 103 minutes. It felt longer----not because the pace was sluggish (it was actually quite smooth!), but because I felt like I had gotten to know these characters, both the major and minor ones, so unusually well and been on such an immensely satisfying journey with them. I confess that I was a little conflicted over Hinds' Frederick during his first couple of scenes, as he seemed a little slicker and more overconfident than I had envisioned the character. Soon, though, we see that he's an incredibly genuine, emotional, passionate and honorable man. Amanda Roots' Anne Elliot evolves naturally from a sweet and endlessly patient but more reticent and passive figure to a woman of quiet strength who is determined to finally pursue her own happiness. The story is subtly poignant (in contrast to the more melodramatic, emotionally overwrought 2007 version, which I also enjoyed but didn't feel was nearly as true to Austen's story or style!) As with all of the best Austen adaptations, there's tons of sly wit and insights into human nature that are every bit as relatable today as they were then. It's visually striking, and the dialogue is deliciously rewind-worthy. If I had to offer up one complaint, it might be that Anne's sisters Elizabeth and Mary are a bit exaggeratedly awful to the point where I sort of dread their appearances, but you could also say that their flaws add humor to the film. Either way, that's a VERY minor quibble over a film that's in my opinion deserving of the highest praise. Enjoy!;Can I give more than five?!
56;12.0;4.0;32.0;-710.6502298850573;"This is clearly one of the most polarising of Jane Austen adaptations on film. Some viewers will love the genuinely moving acting, the authentically costumed characters, the beautiful scenery and sets, the incredible story-telling and the wonderfully subtle touches that abound in this film. Others will loathe the complete absence of makeup, the fact that Amanda Root is visibly older than 29, the slow and tender story, the use of natural lighting and the re-writing of the Mr Elliot sub-plot (including his unforgivably and casually cruel behaviour towards Mrs Smith).\n\nI acknowledge both of these views. Certainly Amanda Root does not enhance her natural sweet looks, and she does look a little too old for the part of Anne Elliot, but mon dieu, her acting! That is something else again. In terms of the emotional involvement and the ability to subtly create this gentle and loving character, no better actress could have been found. If only she'd  been permitted to ""youthify"" her looks a little... After all, in the novel she is described as a very pretty girl - although it's true her looks had faded somewhat, her appearance revives mid-way through the novel to the point where she has enough beauty to attract the admiration of passing gentlemen - but to be honest, I do prefer superb acting to superb looks, and that is why I find Amanda Root's portrayal so very moving and real.\n\nCiarn Hinds is excellent as Captain Wentworth, Anne's love whose proposal she rejected some years ago. He is not movie-star handsome, but a well-looking man whose serious demeanour is not cloaked by his occasional more lively ripostes. In personality and character, he is undeniably the right match for Ms Root's Anne. The interaction between the two of them is so gracefully subtle that it might be missed by viewers who expect a more obvious approach. He is very deliberately ignoring Anne, although with perfect politeness. More and more, the appreciative viewer will notice that there is a quite remarkable sensitivity between the two of them, and the beauty of Anne's character is so wonderfully brought out by Amanda Root's acting that the love between these two characters is truly and fully realised.\n\nThe sub-plots are also superbly explicated. Anne's selfish and heedless father (Corin Redgrave) and monstrously insensitive and vain sister Elizabeth(Phoebe Nicholls), not to mention her laughably tiresome sister Mary (Sophie Thompson), are so well played that one becomes genuinely outraged on Anne's behalf as one sees their carelessly selfish behaviour. Mr Elliot (the brilliant Samuel West) doesn't really get enough storytime in this adaption, unfortunately - I do think the script didn't quite manage to include his motivations and personality well enough for a proper understanding of his character. But the wonderful Fiona Shaw is perfect in the role of Mrs Croft (Anne's put-upon friend who has fallen upon hard times), and Lady Russell (Anne's mentor) is just sheer delight in her well-meaning snobbery as played by Susan Fleetwood. I also found absolutely perfect the self-seeking Mrs Clay (Felicity Dean) and the thoroughly nice Charles Musgrove who, having been rejected by Anne, decided to wed Mary instead (very, very well played by Simon Russell Beale, who makes this sort of role look completely effortless).\n\nThe look of this film is lovely in many ways. The lack of makeup may take some getting used to, but there's no denying it's authentic, and with such excellent acting from everyone involved, the dynamics of the film are unsurpassed.\n\nThe truly magnificent singing of opera singer Rosa Mannion in one of the scenes is the first truly appropriate musical performance in any Jane Austen film. (All too often, the standard of singing or playing in this sort of film is clearly 'quite nice', but certainly not the result of natural talent honed by years of training - as would indeed have been the case with young ladies of the genteel class. Or... if no natural talent was possessed, perhaps the young lady in question would learn the harp instead of singing. But music was an essential asset for any damsel of the period who had any pretensions at all to social graces.)\n\nTo sum up: for those who want a film that is purely escapist, that is full of lovely-looking people floating about in 18th century clothing and that is ""exciting"" to watch, this is probably not a film that will appeal to you. For those, however, who are willing to plunge solely into the subtleties of this film and its beautifully moving performances, there will be great enjoyment for you.";A beautifully subtle and genuinely emotional film

Root and Hinds really capture the weariness and hopelessness (and great integrity) of Anne and Wentworth as we begin the story. Of all of Austen's leading characters, these two so deserve a happy ending.\n\nThe Elliot family and the countess Dalrymple are buffoonish, but really so awful it's hard to laugh at them as Austen wants us to -- maybe we are looking at them through Anne's eyes.\n\nThis movie is beautifully filmed on the best locations (Bath is gorgeous!), but the direction and acting is controlled and understated in the very best way.\n\nThere are so many good Austen movies and series out there, but the only one that really compares with this one for dramatic impact is Joe Wright's 2005 Pride and Prejudice with Kiera Knightly.;"One of the best Austen adaptations ever made; maybe the best."

17;15.0;1.0;21.0;-507.7648903878583;"It's been a little while since I first (and last) watched this version of Persuasion, but I remember very well how much I disliked it.  I promised myself as soon as it ended that I would never watch it again.\n\nPersuasion is a late novel, one of Austen's most autobiographical.  It's a story written by and about a woman who'd lost love and reconciled herself to never finding it again.  Nowhere in this adaptation does that idea come about.  And if you've honestly never read the book, I'm astonished you even know what's going on throughout the film.\n\nAnd still more, one of the greatest things about Austen's novels is that they still have the power, even now, to make a reader feel exactly what the character feels.  Unfortunately, this adaptation of the novel has none of that power.  Even knowing how Anne feels in any particular scene (from reading the novel a dozen times), I still couldn't see any sort of emotion from Amanda Root--every emotion seemed to be exactly the same.  But, that said, Root by no means displayed the worst acting in the film.  That dishonor goes to Ciaran Hinds, who can't play a romantic character to save his life.  His acting is based on extremes--there's either too much emotion or too little.  He displays an intensity that's just a little bit too uncomfortable.  And for the two romantic roles I've seen him in (Wentworth in this and Rochester in the '97 Jane Eyre), he introduces a violent and quite frankly frightening side to his characters.  That's fine for a staged adaptation or something, but not for a film--it's a liberty that can completely ruin a character.  Austen's heroines love their heroes not because they represent forbidden pleasures and masochism but because they're men--usually just plain and simple men.\n\nAnd even worse than the poor acting are the horrible age discrepancies between actors and characters.  It's one of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to film adaptations of beloved Austen novels.  The majority of Austen's heroines are in their early twenties--some are still in their teens--but it seems that when these characters are cast for a film, their ages are completely ignored.  In the case of this Anne Elliot, Root fits the part to begin with, but when Anne ""regains her bloom"" in the novel, nothing ever happens to Root, who still looks a little old and haggard.  And Hinds was 42 when he played the part of Wentworth, a character who is in his early to mid thirties, and he looked every day of his age.  I can understand casting for talent more than age, especially with a beloved classic such as Persuasion, but there's no talent here.  They could have hunted down a couple of university students who would have looked their part better and acted much better than the two leads.\n\nFor someone who has read the novel (or even someone who hasn't), I would suggest staying away from this verison of Persuasion.  Honestly, if you want to watch a version of Persuasion, turn to the '07 version.  It's not entirely true to the book, but the majority of the liberties they took with the story are acceptable, and the acting is immensely better.  An adaptation with a few good liberties taken can turn out to be better than an adaptation that claimsm to be entirely true to the novel.";Poorly cast and horribly conveyed

However Amanda Root's interpretation of Anne is so at odds with my reading of her that it spoiled the film for me. While her depressed and downtrodden demeanor may have been at least somewhat appropriate in the beginning, there was no sign of the remarkably improved features and color that Austen described during the Musgrove party's sojourn at Lyme, and there was nothing in Anne's looks, complexion or expression that would have caused the Walter Elliot character to look at her twice, as the novel demanded. The sprightly personality and sense of humor which is an integral part of the character that Austen created was missing entirely. The director also took too many liberties with Jane Austen's story, having the characters behave in a manner which seems foreign both to the times and to their personalities. I am particularly thinking of the way in which Wentworth announces his intention to marry Anne during the gathering in her father's salon. After seeing this movie I intend to check out the 1971 version, which several reviewers have felt was far more faithful to Jane Austen's. And after all, that's why most of us want to view it.;A Disappointing Adaptation
144;18.0;5.0;32.0;-95.05452261306529;"Amanda Root plays Anne Elliot wonderfully, though I think Ciaran Hinds was a bit over the top in his portrayal of Wentworth. I don't think Jane Austen had such a forceful Wentworth in mind when she wrote Persuasion.  All the  same, the BBC has come fairly close to rendering as faithful a rendition of  the book as can be done in a 2 hour film. They do a lovely job of bringing  a sad, worn woman back to youthful bloom as she is more in the sphere of  her old love. The actors who played Anne's sisters were terrific, but her  father wasn't near the ""fop"" in the book as portrayed in the  movie. The story is a terrific one, about love lost and re-won, and what  can befall you if you do not trust your own judgment even when it is  superior to those around you.  This is one of Jane's rare novels where she  takes you to different areas of England...from the countryside to Bath, to  Lyme Regis. It makes for lovely photography and creates visual interest.  This is one of those movies you'll be drawn to watch again and again.";Another BBC Winner

Unlike some other reviewers on this site, I found Amanda Root to be a perfect choice for the role of Anne Elliott, who had ""lost her bloom"" at age 27. At the beginning of the movie, Root's Anne is timid, often self-effacing, and her physical appearance is, frankly, plain. Thoroughout the course of the film, as she rediscovers her feelings for Captain Wentworth (Ciaran Hinds)she becomes more animated and self-assured, and by the end of the movie, sure of the captain's love, she positively blooms again. I liked the cast in general, although I thought that Hinds may have been an older Captain Wentworth than Austen envisioned. Corin Redgrave gave his usual excellent performance as the vain and foppish father of Anne and Elizabeth. I did not care for Phoebe Nicholls interpretation of Elizabeth Elliott, however. Ms Nicholls, who was so brilliant in ""Brideshead Revisited,"" played Elizabeth (who is in her late 20s) as a spoiled teenager who would have been more at home in the Los Angeles of the 1990s than early 19th century England. Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma) and Fiona Shaw were outstanding as Mary Musgrove and Mrs. Croft, respectively.\nThe film makers did take some liberties with the story....it has been commented on several times by critics that Anne and the Captain never kissed in Austen's novel. While this is true, most of the film adaptations of Austen's works that I have seen include scenes of kissing between men and women who have come to an understanding of their love for each other. ""Persuasion"" is certainly a more faithful adaptation of Austen than is ""Mansfield Park,"" which was released about the same time, probably because it does not have a political ax to grind.";A Worthy Adaptation of a Favorite Book

Or will she cave in yet again to her families wishes?\n\nOne of the delights of this film, as well as the darker aspects, is the unvarnished look into the lives of the families around Anne. We see her own family's problems, and we also see what could have been had she married someone else and made other choices. Anne herself is well respected by many who frankly, are people in this day and age would be well liked!\n\nThe main reason I love this film besides how well the characters are defined is that the atmosphere created is so real.

She also displayed a subtle strength which I did not see in the character at all. Obviously the movie cannot go into the same depth as the book but I found at times they movie veered from the book too much changing the characters in ways that did not do the story justice.

The reason for this being that story is about love lost and the fear that it might never be able to be regained, two subjects that are difficult to portray without great acting, scenery and music. Luckily for the viewer, this adaptation of 'Persuasion' has all of that.\n\nIt really resonates with you from how it just captures each character perfectly and displays how aggravating the unbearably suffocating social etiquette of Regency England truly was. This might have seemed 'romantic' and 'emotional' in some overly sentimental Hollywood period films but in this adaptation, you see how heartbreaking it is. It is a raw and unflinching portrayal of how Regency England would have been like for the debt-ridden landed gentry yet it is a subtle and almost repressed tale of the choices we make.\n\nThe acting is sublime, I cannot applaud it more and other reviewers agree with me so it just can't be dissed! The music was beautiful and I loved the attention to detail that the camera gave - it just shows that the BBC weren't trying to make an adaptation that would make loads of money, they did it to fulfill what Austen wanted us to see.\n\nI can see why some enthusiasts of the novel would feel that better looking people should have played the two main characters because that is Austen describes it in the book but don't be put off! The choice of actors actually works better because it is just about pure emotion, not how fit they are in the book.\n\nLast Thought: This adaptation won't be for everyone but if you just want to appreciate matters of the soul without having image or superficiality in the middle of things, don't be dissuaded - watch 'Persuasion'.;''Wentworth, he's a nobody''

I thought the script was a real work of art and talant - so few words (sometimes not even words, but only looks) and so much meaning is relayed.\n\nActors (particulary Ann and Captain Wentworth) are magnificent - they capture their characters so true to the novel - the filmmakers were really lucky to find such fantastic cast.  Why hasn't Amanda Root been seen in any other movies is beyond my imagination, she was amazingly genuine.

The movie is shot in a way that is more keeping with what the time period would have really looked like.  The cast is not a typically beautiful Hollywood group and look like they could live next door.  Amanda Root does such a wonderful job of making Anne's transformation from the workhorse spinster sister to an independent (as much as possible at the time) happy woman.  She conveys the change in Anne when she goes from being a victim of heartbreak to moving on and finally to happiness.  All done without makeup.  Ciaran Hinds is brilliant as Captain Wentworth who is also heartbroken and is able to mend his heart and love again.\n\nThere are many film adaptations of Jane Austin's books and I enjoy them all but this quiet story is touching in a way unlike the others.

103;26.0;5.0;21.0;-698.874329896907;"""Persuasion,"" the film, is a faithful adaptation of Jane Austen's final completed novel, and to my mind her finest book. It is directed, with subtlety and brilliance, by Roger Michell. The film is quite able to stand alone, on its own merits - you don't have to know Ms. Austen's work to be captivated by the pure magic of the romance, the Regency English period history, brilliant characterizations, color, music and costumes of this extraordinary drama brought to life on the screen. The movie deals with the same social issues as the book, especially the British class system. Rigid social barriers existed - and everyone wanted to marry ""up"" to a higher station - and into wealth. This is also a very poignant and passionate tale of love, disappointment, loss and redemption. The point is clearly that one shouldn't ever be persuaded to abandon core values and beliefs, especially for ignoble goals. There are consequences, always.\nSir Walter Elliot, Lord of Kellynch Hall, is an extravagant, self-aggrandizing snob, and a bit of a dandy to boot. He has been a widower for many years and spends money beyond his means to increase his social stature. His eldest daughter, who he dotes on, is as conceited and spoiled as he is. The youngest daughter, Anne (Amanda Root), is an intelligent, sensitive, capable and unassuming woman in her late twenties when the film begins. She had been quite pretty at one time, but life's disappointments have taken their toll and her looks are fading. She and her sister are both single. Anne had once been very much in love with a young, and as yet untried, navel officer. A woman who had been a close friend to Anne's mother, persuaded Anne to call off the engagement, convincing her that she could make a much better match. After much consideration, Anne did not follow her heart or her better instincts, and she and her young officer, Frederick Wentworth (Ciaran Hinds), separated. She has never again found the mutual love or companionship that she had with him.\nThe Elliot family is forced to financially retrench because of their extravagance. They lease Kellynch Hall to...of all people...Wentworth's sister and her husband. Elliot, his oldest daughter and her companion, move to a smaller lodging in Bath for the season, leaving Anne to pack up their belongings before joining them. She gets the Cinderella treatment throughout the film. Anne chooses this time to visit with her middle sister, an abominably spoiled, whiny hypochondriac, Mrs. Musgrove. She has made a good, but not brilliant match to a local squire. Charles Muskgrove, her husband, his parents, and their two younger, eligible daughters, Louisa and Henrietta, are delightful. There are wonderfully warm scenes of family and friends dining, dancing, hiking over the gorgeous countryside, and at the seashore, that bring the audience smack into early 19th century English life. It is at the Muskgrove estate that Anne meets Frederick Wentworth again, after his absence of seven years. He is in the neighborhood, because his sister is now in the area, residing at Kellynch, of course. Wentworth is now a Captain in the Royal Navy and quite wealthy. When their eyes meet for the first time, you can absolutely feel Anne's longing and remorse. Intense. I cannot imagine a better actress to play Anne than Amanda Root. She slowly transforms herself from a sallow, aging spinster to a luminescent woman in love - and this is Not just the makeup. Wentworth/Hinds is aloof with Anne, although civil. The man was hurtfully rejected once before and it appears that he still feels the sting of her snub. Now Wentworth is on the marriage market and Louisa sets her cap for him. Accidents and various adventures ensue, from the resorts of Lyme and Bath to the Muskgrove estate, bringing Anne and Wentworth closer together. The passion between the two is palpable, although Very understated, (this is Regency England after all). If Ms. Root is the perfect Anne, then Mr. Hinds is the best possible Wentworth. He is as large and virile as she is petite and feminine. He oozes sexuality...but again, he portrays his character with great subtlety. The entire production is brilliantly cast and the acting is superb\nI think this is Ms. Austen's most passionate piece. Some scholars say that she modeled Anne Elliot after herself.\nThis remarkable film, like the novel, and the issues it tackles, is just as germane today as it was when written. Each time I view it, it just gets better. And the romance...well, no one does romance better than Jane Austen.";A Superb Film Adapted From A Literary Masterpiece
145;27.0;4.0;22.0;-663.9625675675675;"If you like Jane Austin's style of romance, character development, and plot construction, then you will probably like this film.\nThe story involves the possibility of a second chance at romance conflicted with the  resentment left over from the first attempt. The result has been described  as ""an adult fairy tale"" or the perfect ""chick flick.""  To a degree I could agree with either description, but the story's conflict  is a bit more complex then one would expect for an ""adult fairy  tale.""  The conflict between the romantic and rational is  demonstrated: Lady Russell attempts to influence Anne to marry Eliot for  rational reasons all while Anne feels romantically inclined towards  Whetworth. Lady Russell has succeed before since it was her ability to  persuade Anne to turn Wentworth's proposal of marriage down eight years  before. The world's repeated intrusion especially at points when the two  are about to reconcile is contrasted with an unusual scene when a circus  (symbolically the world) finally passes them by when the conflicts are  finally resolved.\nThe character development is subtle. My wife and I have  watched this film many times, and each time we have noticed something new.  Wentworth is resentful, but he still loves Anne (but he goes out of his way  not to show it). Anne still loves Wentworth, but is being careful because  she doesn't want to be hurt. Her comment that her sex will still love  longest when all hope is gone is a perfect summation of her attitude. Most  of the characters are three dimensional, with a couple of intended  exceptions: Anne's father and sister are amusingly single dimensional. The  unintential one dimensional exceptions are Mr Eliot, Lady Russell, and Mrs.  Smith for reasons that will be covered later.\nThe plot construction  involves a series of social reversals that have taken place in eight years:  those reversals involve the economic situation between Wentworth and Anne's  family, the romantic reversals, and the social reversals. The social  reversals are particularily amusing as one observes Anne's father and  sister's obsession with rank and connections. This behavior is reasonable  since the father and sister seem to have lost everything else.\nThere are  several additional things that I like about this film. The photography is  excellect, the sound is good, and the music is simple. The music is  especially good being made up of period pieces played on original  instruments (original instruments have an unusual twang not present in  modern versions of the same instruments).\nThe things that I don't like  might be slightly minor to most audiences: Lady Russell is portrayed  unusually harsh in this film. In other versions of Persuasion (1971), I  believe her character is treated more fairly, yes, she has persuaded Anne  in the past, but not strictly for monetary and social reasons. In the book  and the earlier film, Lady Russell's behavior is motivated by Anne's  happiness and makes her judgments accordingly. The character of Anne's  friend ""Mrs. Smith"" is portrayed positively in this film (1995)  than in the book or the earlier version of this film (1971). Mrs. Smith is  in a nasty economic situation created by Mr. Eliot. She has a vested  interested in seeing that Anne marries Eliot because it might help her out  of her situation. The 1995 film discards this entire relation and makes the  only connection one of gossip. It makes Mrs. Smith look much nicer, but it  loses yet another view of Mr. Eliot's character. As a result Mr. Eliot and  Mrs. Smith become single dimentional characters and it detracts from the  story. Austin always has at least one rogue in her story. Her rogues  usually have one dark secret which is revealed at some point in her story,  and Persuasion is no exception. But Mr. Eliot's motives, and actions seem  strangely disconnected until nearly the end. Even his relationship with  Mrs. Clay (which is a significant point in the 1971 film and book) is  glossed over. One has to read between the lines to infer his intentions in  regard to Mrs. Clay.\nI highly recommend this film. I especially recommend  the DVD version with a small amplifier and a pair of external speakers  since some subtle statements, background noise, and music could be lost. I  know since I have watched this film many times on VHS and DVD.\nMy wife  and I love watching this film";A Film that Needs to be Watched Carefully

Yet Roger Michell's adaptation of ""Persuasion"" for the BBC is perhaps the most faithful of the many Austen adaptations that followed, and is still simultaneously the best. Like Patricia Rozema in :""Mansfield Park,"" he brings great intelligence and brings forth certain latent ideas in the text that speak to the era in which he filmed it: he shows the grubbiness of the Regency era, and emphasizes the differences in class relations. But unlike Rozema, Michell has the good sense to trust Austen and allow his heroine to be as quiet and as patient as the author wrote her to be. Amanda Root, with her beautiful undertsanding eyes that speak volumes, is as faithful to Austen's conception of the role as could be imagined. The rest of the cast is terrific: Corin Redgrave enjoyed some well deserved praise later in his career for his snobbish and empty headed Sir Walter Elliot, and Phoebe Nicholls is just as good as his eldest daughter (given to fits of pique against her sister Anne).

Ms. Root wonderfully portrays the disillusioned yet romantic Anne, and captures the essence of her being, which you can see in the touching metamorphosis she goes through, both  touching and empoworing. Mr. Hinds brings subtlety to the dashing Captain Wentworth and the sense of reserve and resentment he harbors for Anne is all but broken through his acquaitance with her.  But the beauty of the film lies in the way it presents British society, and the interaction between the classes for power, love and money. The supporting cast brilliantly contrasts the fickleness and superficiality of the titled, with the more greagarious, engaging, and friendly non-titled-- the rich landowners, the educated, the Navy, and the working class...\n\nThis gem of a film brought to us by BBC Films is beautifully shot, and the restraint that true lovers have with one another is one of the most poignant episodes in the rocky courtship between Anne and Wentworth.\n\nLess comedic than Ms. Austen's other works, Persuasion really is about knowing what you want, and be pursuaded to pursue your happiness.\n\nI loved this film for its beautiful lighting, its dialogue,and the way it depicted relationships between people, romance, courtship and marriage, and ultimately society and social etiquette in the 19th century.\n\nI hope you will too.;19th Century revisited...

But about halfway through the story the script takes a couple of odd turns, departing from the spirit of the novel in ways I found irritating.  These departures seemed designed to hustle things along to fit a movie timeframe, which is unavoidable, but they didn't have to be quite so obvious.\n\nFor instance, Wentworth stiffly requests a private interview on a street corner to ask on behalf of ""my admiral"" whether she'll want to move into Kellynch after marrying Mr. Elliot?!  And declares his intention of marrying Anne right in the middle of Sir Walter and Elizabeth's party--to everyone?!\n\nAusten had written an early ending that used a PRIVATE interview, but she ditched this (for good reason) and replaced it with a chat with the admiral and the letter.  Austen had decided the interview conclusion was too rushed--which I suppose is why they used it for the movie.\n\nOverall, the first half is worth the annoyance of the second. Someone who hasn't read the book over and over won't notice much wrong, but brace yourself, dedicated Austen fan, for a few bumps along the road.  The perfect video adaptation may come along someday.";Strong start, odd finish
53;32.0;5.0;15.0;-269.96279069767434;"As i began this movie, i was disappointed. The main actress did not have the beautious presence of the protagonists in the adaptations of Mansfield Park, Emma, or the A&E Pride & Prejudice. The sets were not particularly vibrant, and the characters were, well, normal people. However as the movie progressed, i became impressed against my own first impression. Amanda Root brings forth the spellbinding silence and oppression of intelligent, regretful young ladies, with smaller claims to youth and beauty than others. Her pain is so tangible, and her loneliness so palpable, you can't help but feel for the accomplished and overlooked Anne. Like Sense and Sensibilities Colonel Brandon, in Willoughby's words, she is ""the man (in this case woman) that everyone speaks well of, but no one remembers to talk to"". As the film progresses she seems to become prettier and livelier, and her repression begins to lift, and you see her true geniality and open-heartedness. As for Ciaran Hinds...well, not only is he handsome, but he plays his part with such feeling and passion that you can't help but wait in anticipation for the inevitably happy conclusion. Both parts are semi-stereotypical...Anne, who mistakenly turned down her true love due to the faulty advice of her friend, pines and diminishes, becoming quiet and somber in near self-induced solitude. Wentworth, being the man, seeks occupation overseas and tries to forget her. He can't, however he is less forgiving, being the one spurned so many years ago, and you spend half the movie agonizing over his attentions to the unaccomplished, flirtatios, more beautiful Louisa. All in all, a good watch, with the feeling and sad repression of true love that makes Austen amazing. Anne and Wentworth are not as funny as Darcy and Elizabeth, but instead are reminiscent of the sensible, quiet adoration of such characters as Elinor and Colonel Brandon...not ostentatious, not overly flirtatious, but sensible and sad and loving and repressed.

It isn't exactly poorly done, but it could be far far better, and suffers badly from comparison with Emma Thompson's ""Sense & Sensibility"" and of course with A&E's exquisite ""Pride & Prejudice"" but it could be far, far better. I too had high hopes after reading so many glowing reviews, the story will always be memorable, but it is almost a filmed version of Cliff's Notes on Austen's original tale. It runs 104 minutes to S&S 136 to P&P's 6 volume set. Why? Perhaps it was designed around television commercial space.\nWhat particularly grated was the casting and much direction which was strangely off. The eldest sister Elizabeth is pissy and crude although she has been in charge of Sir Walter's social responsibilities and second only to him in ""precedence"" since her mother's death. It is not necessary to have her slouch in a chair and throw papers about in a pout to establish her character as a bad egg. Neither one, especially Ann, is believable as daughter of nobility and the upper class. Ann in particular clomps about clumsily, starts, scuttles, and hides. One can hardly imagine her daring to give an order to anyone (other than calling for a doctor after Louisa's fall) although giving orders to servants is her station in life. The very elegant and lovely and believable Lady Russell has been her close companion and surrogate mother since Ann lost her own mother at 14 - and this is the result? Compare to Lady Russell herself, to the S&S apparently lower ranking Eleanor Dashwood (Emma Thompson) saying her farewells to the servants or the elegant creature who Marianne Dashwood discovers to be her replacement, or to P&P Elizabeth and Jane Bennet. Rather than an image of a Lady of gentle quietness, forebearance and resignation, she seems more a scared rabbit. I could see her in the role of the starting, clomping, bewildered maid in P&P being ordered to stop working on Lizzy's hair and attend to Miss Jane. She does the staring traumatized eyes quite well however, so they are featured in nearly every scene. The hypochondriac youngest daughter Mary is well acted - but she even seems older than Ann.\nWhat is NOT featured is any kind of dialogue that would establish the character that is claimed for her. We have only the doormat behavior to establish deference to others; the blandishments of the scheming Mr. Elliott on skill at Italian; the final speech overheard by Capt. Wentworth. We should be allowed to see more of her than what is filtered through her blind and belittling family, not less.\nP&P actually added character development - for example, not until the scene at the Rosings pianoforte did it occur to me that part of Mr. Darcy's problem just might be that he is as naturally shy as his sister, or why Georgiana had specifically NOT been entrusted to the tender care of Lady Catherine. Edward in S&S was beautifully developed through Margaret's Atlas (in a wonderful scene that does not exist in the book).\nI don't suppose I will never ever watch it again, but it has sent me back to re-read the novel. A good thing, that, as is the reminder that a wonderful story does not automatically make a wonderful movie all on its own - and the critical impact of good direction, the overall artistry of casting, lighting, staging, landscape. One of the things I love about DVDs (such as S&S) is the opportunity to listen to scene commentary by the actors and directors, to understand how very much goes into the making of a good or great film, how little into poor or merely adequate ones.";Great story marred by poor casting and direction

This particular film adaptation by Nick Dear of PERSUASION respects not only the spirit of the novel but also the station of the author.  Under Roger Mitchell's keen direction this cinematic reenactment of the belated flowering of a Anne Elliot's eight year thwarted longing for the love of naval officer Frederick Wentworth, all due to the 'impropriety' of Wentworth's financial standings of the past, is placed before us as a quietly gentle song, one that still places the scrutinizing Austen microscope on the social mores of the time and the bows to class distinctions that serve as the matrix for Austen's novels.\n\nThe cast is excellent, with Amanda Root suitably in the background as Anne Elliot and Ciarn Hinds as the wise and slightly weathered Captain Wentworth.  But their superb performances would not be as credible were it not for the large cast of fine actors playing the superficial silly sisters and cousins and the haughty ladies as well as the warm and worthy ones.  This is first rate ensemble acting, allowing the quiet pulse of Austen's Anne to beat softly behind longing eyes, making her plight and ultimate reward for perseverance step stage front at the end of the film.  The music of Chopin and Bach flavor the score by Jeremy Sams and the presence of Rosa Mannion, soprano, singing arias and songs lends both an aural and visual credibility to the atmosphere so ably captured by cinematographer John Daly.  This is a satisfying Jane Austen adaptation.  Grady Harp, January 08;A Suitable Persuasion

That one I've read more times than I can count. I also own a copy of this movie, and I've watched it more times than I can count. Never have I seen a movie adaptation that was so right on with every step it takes. Beginning with the casting, (which is superb, from the leads down to the one-liners) and continuing through the script, direction, and acting, this movie never misses. If you're a lover of the book, you'll love this masterful adaptation. The writer includes just the right parts and leaves out just enough. The meticulous attention to REAL period detail ( only candlelight at night, characters with a limited number of items in their wardrobe, period faces unadorned with modern makeup, etc.) sink you wholly into Austen's world. This is not a movie that shows off it's period finery, and that's as it should be. Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds might as well have been born to play these roles. Anne reading Wentworth's letter at the end of the film is so romantic that it still makes me nearly swoon when I watch it. (You listen to Ciarin Hinds say ""You pierce my soul"" and see if you don't feel the same). This film was so successful, that evertime I re-read the book now, I hear those voices and see those faces in my head. Truly one of the most underrated and best films I've ever seen.";Five stars aren't enough
84;36.0;1.0;15.0;-67.2872727272727;Ok... I am very dissatisfied with this movie. I had just watched Sense and Sensibility in previous days, so I expected it to be that Excellently Done. Boy, was I wrong. This movie (Persuasion) really erased the wonderful scenes and scenarios that I had created in my mind after reading the book.\n\nAmanda Root is so very unconvincing and wrongly cast. While I will not criticize her God given physical appearance, I will say this... she made horribly annoying facial expressions. She also looks oh so much older than 27, she looks pretty much close to 20 years older than that and I am not being mean either. There is absolutely nothing wrong with looking one's age, she just was not suited for such a young part and like wise neither was the actor that played her former suitor (Wentworth).\n\nIn other words, I am not even writing a review, I am VENTING.... AHHHHH, I felt like screaming as I watched this.;YUK!!
11;37.0;1.0;8.0;-106.48765306122444;Luckily, I red the book first. Otherwise, I would not understand the plot. Actors  are so much older that their characters!\nAlso, I did not understand why we have to see almost 2 hours Amanda Root and Ciarn Hindsye  crooked teeth , and constantly consumed by everybody a large amount of food. I did not like the casting of Frederick Wentworth at all!\nYes, even Ann's beauty was gone, she should not look like a 50-years old cleaning lady.\nIt captures Jane Austen's story, it fails in its spirit. Anne is perhaps the most difficult character in all of Austen to portray. Her quiet strength and intelligence are hard to exude on screen. Amanda Root is simply not skilled enough to pull off such a challenging role, where the majority of her lines are unspoken. She portrays instead a dull and vapid creature, almost devoid of personality, When the character actually does have lines, her persona is so very different from the sullen woman portrayed through the rest of the film that it feels utterly incongruous. One of my favorite's from Jane Austen, but sadly the film does not live up to its source.;Horrible version of Persuasion and I did not like the casting of Frederick Wentworth at all
121;38.0;1.0;16.0;-10.434455445544529;I was anticipating watching this movie ... and i was really disappointed by the fact that the casting was completely horrible.  Anne was cast badly, Captain Wentworth was cast badly...in fact the whole cast just seemed out of place. There was no good music in the background, not a significant, good amount of development about Anne and Wentworth's feelings.  Lady Russell was cast badly as well.  This isn't just a biased opnion, i'm sure many people would agree if they saw this movie just how badly it was cast and that the actors just ruined the beautiful story.;Extremely bad casting
92;39.0;4.0;14.0;-2.8480769230769027;Out of the recent film adaptations of the Jane Austen's novellas, this one tops them all. It's not to be compared to BBC's Pride and Prejudice as that's not a film. But when compared to Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility, Gwenyth Paltrow's Emma and Francis O'Conner in Mansfield Park, this film adaptation of 'Persuasion' is my favourite.\n\nI found it difficult to accept the actress as Anne at first,  butshe does grow on you. I found this film exquisite and true to the spirit of the novel.  This version delivers in quality above all the rest.;True to the spirit of the book
100;40.0;5.0;14.0;-276.74203296703297;Persuasion is a masterpiece of subtlety, a fine example of\nthe kind of film that can be made when all involved place\nquality over market value. The film is not for the dense, as it requires patience and the understanding of an era, challenging viewers to read the subtext and to listen to Austen's richly written characters. Notice (those who've seen the film many times) how lines giving away important details are thrown away, spoken in a matter-of-fact manner, so easy to miss if you're not paying close attention. It took me several viewings to\ngrasp every detail of the story (haven't read the book).\nIn fact, it took me a couple of viewings to even like the film, much less love it as I do now!\nI wanted it so much to be as electrifying as Pride and Prejudice. I wanted fireworks from these two lovers, the kind of impassioned conversations you'd hear from Miss Bennett and Mr. Darcy. But it's just not that kind of romance. Anne and Wentworth have a private and painful history that nobody seems to understand but them. There is the surface knowledge between the other characters, but then such a heavy, quiet knowledge between the main two. They are NOT meant to engage in a battle of wits or lash out at one another in fits of anger. They are meant to rekindle the deep, meaningful feelings they once had for each other, but delicately, gradually, and almost as secretly as their initial engagement.\nAmazing how this dashing, macho Captain of the Navy becomes stifled around Anne. Love is so much scarier to him than any sea battle. At first he is aloof, avoids her, downright ignores her. He comes around so gradually, yet so inevitably, as does Anne's soul. And nobody notices the reasons for their respective transformations, their growing attachment, but them. Their affection for one another is their own little secret shared only with the most sensitive viewer.\nI urge those who didn't like it to watch it again. There is so much beauty and grace in this film. It is a rare and genuine treasure.;brilliant and beautiful
91;41.0;5.0;13.0;-27.14859504132228;"I happened across this movie in, of all places, a bargain bin several years ago. This is one of my all time favorite movies. Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root give knock out proformances, the supporting cast is just as high caliber, the sets are accurate and visually stimulating and the film, IMO, is on par with A&E's Pride and Prejudice.\n\nI recently began switching my VHS over to DVD. While this DVD has no special features, it was great getting a more accurate cover than the old VHS had (an embarrasing ""clutch"" shot of two models who aren't ever in the movie!). If you love the Regency period or an ""Austenite""-you cannot pass this film up:)";perfect regency drama...
23;42.0;1.0;10.0;-37.34999999999995;"Having very much enjoyed recent (and not so recent --- 1940's P&P) film versions of my favorite Austen books (P&P, S&S, and Emma) I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, since Persuasion is probably my ""favoritest"" Austen of all. How disappointing!  I have no quarrel with the casting or the costumes or the sets or the scenery; BUT it seems to me that anyone who hasn't read the book will have little or no idea where the title comes from.  Lady Russell's persuasions eight years before the novel opens are only alluded to in passing, and those during the course of the movie itself seem more like intimidations.\n\n  Rather they should have titled this particular film ""Family From Hell, after an idea of Jane Austen's""";How disappointing!
63;43.0;5.0;12.0;-409.0566867469879;"I love this movie!  Amanda Root (forgive me for saying this) is a plainer and slightly older Anne than I had envisioned, but her acting is so wonderful, that we soon forget the physical discrepancy between the book and the movie. (Don't get me wrong, Amanda Root is in no way unattractive, but in the novel, Anne is constantly praised for her beauty/handsomeness, although at the ""ripe old age"" of 27, she is apparently past her ""bloom."")  Ciarin Hinds played the jilted lover to perfection: he all but ignores Anne during the movie's early scenes and never betrays the feelings he tries fruitlessly to supress. He woos Louisa Musgrove as a ruse to deny his own feelings for Anne.  It isn't until Captain Wentworth observes how fatigued Anne is during a long walk with his friends and acquaintances, that we see his concern for Anne's welfare is still intact. Anne is very touched by this gesture of Captain Wentworth in securing her a space on his sister and brother-in-law's carriage where there is room for only one lady.\n\nAnne and the nouveau riche captain are given another chance at love, despite interferring friends and dubious circumstances. Anne's cousin, Mr. Elliot, suddenly feels the lure of social respectability.  I don't think the screenwriter needed to change Mr. Elliot's financial circumstances in order to make him appear more odious to the audience.  In the book, Mr. Elliot had more than enough money, but he thought marrying Anne would bring about the appearance of social respectability. He unsuccessfully tries to woo her (""Really Mr. Elliot, this is too much flattery"").  It is too bad he didn't set his sights on Elizabeth Elliot, as they seem cut from the same fabric.  Captain Wentworth misinterprets Anne's feelings for her cousin (thank God we don't marry our cousins anymore!).  However, in one of movie history's most beautiful scenes, Captain Wentworth subtly gestures to Anne that he has written her a letter. I cry every time I watch Anne read about Wentworth's true feelings for her and how he could never forget her, try as he may.\n\nOne part of the movie that I didn't quite like was the portrayal of Lady Russell. Yes, she was officious and misguided, but she was like a second mother to Anne (in the book).  In the movie, she is practically demonized as an unrepentant social snob, whom Wentworth ""will find difficult to forgive.""  In the book, Wentworth and Lady Russell are reconciled, and she recognizes the error of her judgment and short-sightedness. She did try to act in Anne's best interest, but like our charming and irrepressible Emma, ended up being completely in the wrong regarding matters of the heart and matchmaking.\n\nI loved the soprano (Rosa Mannion) who sang during one of the concerts in Bath. What a voice! I'd love to hear more from this singer.";A Beautiful Adaptation
142;44.0;4.0;15.0;-378.16199566160515;"Bear in mind that I am one of those to whom every omission from the book in filming is a misdemeanor and every addition a felony.  Having indicated that bias, I will omit the list of the corresponding crimes committed in  filming ""Persuasion.""  Some compression of action is inevitable, and some  thoughts must be expressed in words.  I admit the necessity while I deplore  it.\nThe price paid by streamlining action and painting characters in  broad strokes is that one loses the hallmark of a Jane Austen novel: the  masterful development of character by the careful drawing of one fine line  after another.  The film takes care with Anne Elliot and takes liberties  elsewhere.  Anne is my personal favorite of the Austen heroines, and I was  pleased by the manner in which she is brought to the screen.  I found  Captain Wentworth an acceptable, if tongue-tied suitor.  So much for the  principals.  I have small reservations with most of the supporting cast.  Sister Mary whines appropriately, and her husband Charles is rendered  fairly.  The Lyme household is suitably pleasant company, and the Musgroves  come across well.  Changing Charles Hayter's first name to Henry was a good  idea.  There are five people named Charles in the original novel.  There  was no good reason to change Fanny Harville's name to Phoebe, but no harm  done either.  The Crofts have more dignity in the film than in the book  reducing a desired contrast with Sir Walter and Elizabeth Elliot.  William  Elliot is too young for my taste, and the film fails to define Lady  Russell's role clearly.  Short shrift is given, necessarily, to minor  characters such as Mr. Shepherd, Mrs. Clay, Mrs. Smith, Nurse Root, and the  Dalrymples.\nI think the film failed with Sir Walter and Elizabeth.  Sir  Walter had many faults, but he was entitled to be satisfied with his  appearance.  The film's Elizabeth Elliot resembled Lydia Bennet more than  the very superior, elegant baronet's daughter whom Jane Austen gave us.  Elizabeth set my teeth on edge every time she lounged into the room or  opened her common mouth.  We have ample reason to dislike her for her  neglect of Anne.  The caricature was  distracting and unnecessary.  Fortunately, the film can get by without an accurate portrayal of these two  whose facade was so much more pleasing than their substance.\nThose coming  to Jane Austen for the first time through the movie have a treat in store  for them.  Those who love ""Persuasion"" will be glad to have it on film, but  will not find this one of those rare cases where a film is able to do  justice to a book.  You haven't read the book?  Don't wait a minute longer  to do so.";Great (if you don't love the book)
80;45.0;5.0;12.0;48.053684210526335;What a great direction of Jane Austen's Persuasion!  The actor's and actresses chosen brilliantly. If you truly love this era of life, and love Jane Austen, you won't have regretted buying this version.  I can't tell you how many times I've watched it, and I've only owned it for 3 weeks.;Great movie for Jane Austen fans!
13;46.0;1.0;7.0;43.148979591836756;I would have to agree with those who questioned the casting of this wonderful book.  The characters of Anne and Captain Wentworth as they were portrayed in this version simply don't work.  There is little emotion and they appear too old.  Jane Austen's wonderful writing deserved better.;Disappointed
135;47.0;5.0;14.0;-495.09556338028165;"""Persuasion"" is Jane Austen's most romantic and most overheated novel, which admittedly isn't to say that it's exactly ""Wuthering Heights"" - but it does carry a stronger emotional undertow than any of her others.  As such, it also makes for a great movie.\nIt was also her last novel, and if you want to be crudely autobiographical about it, it's a rather wistful revenge fantasy.  Anne Elliot, the only decent and sensible member of the cringingly awful Elliot family, has been fading into regretful spinsterhood ever since she refused marriage to a handsome Navy officer seven years earlier.  Now that her mother is dead and her snobbish roue of a father down on his luck, the family has to rent out the ancestral home (oh, the shame) to a crinkly, friendly Admiral, whose wife happens to be the sister of the man she turned down.  No sooner has Frederick Wentworth, the former suitor, now a successful and dashing Captain, strode back into Anne's life, than all her repressed feelings start to surge back.  With mortifying consequences.\nNick Dear's adaptation was made for the BBC in the shadow of Andrew Davies' much more well-known (and more expensive) version of ""Pride and Prejudice"".  It's far better.  ""Pride and Prejudice"" ended up as an exercise in set dressing, with good performances defeated by lavish frocks and relentless background music.  ""Persuasion"" was shot entirely on location, using only natural light (the evening parties are all in authentic sepia-toned candlelight), and almost all the music is being played in the scene, instead of swamping bad writing with mood.  The characters get wind-blown and muddy and wet.  This isn't really a costume drama at all; the only things that seem alien are the manners.  A lot of this is presumably due to Roger Michell, the director.\nYet Michell also throws the responsibility for conveying this almost entirely unspoken story onto his actors, who excel.  Amanda Root is superb as Anne.  She starts out as a red-faced, mildly haggard-looking spinster and blooms into a radiant heroine, and yet seems to do it entirely without makeup; her manner changes, her gestures and range of expressions become freer, and as her love gains control over her sense of duty, she turns, as it were, into her real self.  Ciaran Hinds is equally good as the impressively sideburned Wentworth; he goes from brusque and almost rude to desperately sincere.  The rest of the cast are distinguished; John Woodvine as the genial Admiral Croft, Fiona Shaw nicely underacting for a change as the Admiral's wife, Corin Redgrave as Anne's risibly pompous and snobbish father, Samuel West as the oleaginous creep of a suitor, Sophie Thompson as Anne's sniffy and hypochondriac sister, Simon Russell Beale as the bluff and endearingly clueless brother-in-law...everybody is good.\nThis is a story told almost entirely by looks alone, and is as such a masterclass in acting, directing and editing.  Easily one of the best Jane Austen adaptations ever, and incidentally one of the most satisfying British films of the 90s.  You can watch it again and again and keep picking up on something you'd missed before.  I'd even say - and you're entitled to shriek and storm off in a petulant frenzy - that in its technical excellence and emotional generosity, it's a better work of art than the original novel.";Shamefully underrated
47;48.0;5.0;11.0;-169.23400778210112;"I'm a late bloomer when it comes to some pieces of literature,  and when I finally started reading Jane Austen in my 30's,  this book stood out as my definite favorite.  I bought a video of the movie when it first came out,  and feel that it captures perfectly the subdued mood and mature humour of the last masterpiece of this magic author.  I recently got the movie out again,  this time because I'm introducing Austen to my home-schooled 12 year old daughter.  Hopefully she won't be the literary ignoramus her mother was,  she already ""gets""  the perfect phrasing and subtle humour that I probably would not have appreciated at her age.\n\n  I've not seen other adaptations of Persuasion,  but don't see how another could so perfectly capture the essence of the novel.  The performances are perfect,  with Anne being transformed from plain neglected spinster to beautiful beloved wife before our very eyes.  The movie portrays Austen's characters as they surely would have been,  no makeup,  a bit dingy in spots,  surrounded by farm animals in the country,  fishwives in Lyme,  and the elegant viciousness of the first circles in Bath.  I think Ciaran Hinds is one of today's great actors,  and watch him every chance I get,  and he and Amanda Root are fabulous together,  both in this and in ""The Man Who Cried.""  For anyone who appreciates Austen,  as it took me so long to do,  this movie is an absolute must for their collection.";My favorite Austen
59;49.0;1.0;11.0;-109.64842364532018;This film makes you believe no attractive people could be found in England to play these parts. Besides the obvious lack of beauty throughout the film, it is boring, dull, and downright laughable at its production attempt. There is no musical score which is excrutiatingly noticeable - particularly during that ridiculous falling off the wall scene. My friend and I love Jane Austen and lap up all period pieces - but sat through this one at the artsy theatre in Atlanta in 1995 and couldn't stop snickering at how horribly done it was. The screenplay might have been a good adaptation of the Jane Austen novel, but this film was terribly executed. Maybe they have done some post-production to enhance it, but I doubt it and I can't bear to watch it again to find out. Do yourself a kindness and get the 6-hour Pride and Prejudice A&E version with Colin Firth - it is perfect. Or Emma with Gwyneth Paltrow or Sense & Sensibility with Emma Thompson - those are great. I keep waiting for A&E or Hollywood to remake this one - it needs help. Good luck getting through it.

111;52.0;5.0;12.0;-245.3639940828402;"Oh yes, this is my kind of movie!! It is a film that requires your complete attention to the actors on the screen; you've got to pay close attention to them because there is not any overt display of feelings/emotions until the very end of the movie. No chewing of the scenery--just superb acting! The eyes of Amanda Root and Ciarian Hinds (as Anne and Captain Wentworth) express a world of emotions--they simply speak volumes. There is not a great deal of ""physical action"" in this film. On the surface, everthing is sooooooo proper, refined and controlled; however, there's ""loads"" going on emotionally inside the characters and that is expressed completely through the actors' eyes and facial expressions. Amanda Root and Ciarian Hinds performances just blew me away! If you are not watching Root's eyes (as Anne) when she first sees Captain Wentworth, you will miss completely what he has meant to her, what he still means to her and what the movie is about--it's all portrayed in her eyes. Ciarian Hinds, as Captian Wentworth, at first keeps ""his cool"" doing the macho thing and not giving the audience a hint of what Anne has meant and stills means to him. But watch that facade start to crumble--again portrayed in his eyes. Some reviewers on this board find Hinds' portrayal of the captain as too distant and cold. I don't. Remember, he was the one rejected by Anne and, to me, he's putting on that ""I'll show her"" routine. But as I previously stated that soon changes and you really find out how much he still loves her.\nI just love acting of this caliber. For me, you can forget the actors that chew up scenery. Give me the ones that can stun you with their depth of emotion and feeling through subtle means of expression--Amanda Root and Ciarian Hinds are such actors. In fact, everyone, in Persuasion, gives superb performances!\nIf you are into wonderful acting, buy this film!";The eyes have it!

The actors are all ""regular-looking"" people without a gorgeous, Hollywood face in the bunch, but the acting is first rate. Amanda Root is brilliant as the faded heroine Ann Eliot, and I really connected with her interpretation of a somewhat shy, intelligent, and often overlooked ""woman of a certain age."" Ciaran Hinds plays Captain Wentworth as stern and serious but then lets you see his vulnerability as he gradually drops his defenses and admits his true feelings. If you're looking for a slick and sexy modernized Austen, this one isn't for you, but if you want a true adaptation of a wonderful story with great acting and a beautiful conclusion, this may turn out to be your favorite, too.";Atypical Beauty!

124;57.0;2.0;12.0;-433.21032629558533;I was thouroughly dissapointed with this film.  I had very high hopes going into it, especially after reading so many glowing reviews.  Jane Austen is my all-time favorite author and Sense and Sensibility is my all-time favorite film.  As I excitedly opened the box and popped the DVD into my machine I was all a flutter, but as the movie progressed my enthusiasm quickly diminished, and until the terribly wrong ending I still had hopes that it could redeem itself.\nI must admit that the acting was good, but the casting (Anne's father being an exception) was all wrong to me.  It seems like they took a crop of well-known, critically-acclaimed British actors and made them fit into the parts, whether they looked and felt right for them or not.  It may be that I'm used to hollywoody pretty people, so I probably could have excused this point if it weren't for the fact that the score was dissapointing and the adaptation was terribly wrong.  Why is it that screenwriters feel they have to make the characters say and do things that Austen would never have made them say and do in order to relate to present-day audiences?  This was a big problem in the recent Mansfield Park as well.  The screenwriter remained faithful to the book in parts where it caused the film to drag and deviated when a faithful adaptiation would've shone.  The ending was the worst example of this, though I will not elaborate for those who are planning to see it.\nAs I said, Sense and Sensibility is my favorite film of all time, and unarguably the perfect Jane Austen adaptation.  If only Emma Thompson would write all of Austen's novels!  Although she didn't copy the novel exactly, one would never know it.  It deviates from the text but still remains faithful to Austen's style and spirit.  Not once do the characters kiss or embrace, but it is still extremely moving and completely romantic, not to mention beautifully directed by Ang Lee.  I highly recommend Sense and Sensibility on DVD if one is looking for an Austen fix.\nPersuasion, on the other hand, was very painful for me, especially as it is my favorite of Austen's novels.  It nearly destroyed the novel for me.  I still have to concentrate very hard to picture the characters as I originally envisioned them.  I wish I had never seen it.  It also has made me reluctant to see other film adaptations of her work.  I am itching to watch the BBC/A&E miniseries of Pride and Prejudice, but I am afraid that it will be just as bad, despite all the good reviews I see.  I relied too heavily on the good reviews I read for Persuasion.\nI may be too critical, or maybe just crazy.  So far I am the only one I know who disliked it so much.  Still, I dissuaded my mom seriously from watching this movie and I would caution others to watch at your own risk.  You may think it is wonderful, but I didn't.;I may be overly critical, but...
127;58.0;5.0;12.0;-184.57487364620937;"Who could fail to be moved by this subtle adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Persuasion""? Of all the Jane Austen features of the last six years or so, this is my personal favorite; in fact, it's one of my ten most favorite movies. It has an intimate feel to it that the other films, good though they are, lack. A wonderful example of this is the scene at the Great House, where the characters are assembled for a dinner given by the Musgroves. The flickering of the candles and the low ceilings convey a gathering where good conversation among genial people flourishes, somewhat reminiscent of ""Babette's Feast"".\n""Persuasion"" concerns Anne Elliot and her lost love, Captain Wentworth. Eight years before the start of the picture, she had refused his marriage proposal, having been persuaded by a family friend that it would be an unsuitable match. Anne, you see, is the daughter of a baronet, while Edward is of no particular lineage. During these years, she has lost both her spirits and her looks, we are told. Then, chance brings Edward back into her life, but as the suitor of a family friend, a much younger woman who is quite vivacious--and he bears a grudge against Anne for her lack of personal conviction. Like all Jane Austen novels, the story then hinges upon whether a hopeless romantic situation can be brought round to our satisfaction.\n""Persuasion"" is the sort of film you can watch again and again, just as if you were visiting with an old friend.

Just a snippet of odd gossip which has nothing to do with this movie adaptation - which I loved.\nAmanda Root was just perfect as Anne Elliot, the woman who had followed the good advice of her friend some seven years before and refused to marry a suitor without many prospects - Captain Wentworth. By sheer coincidence he returns to the neighbourhood with his sister and her husband. Partly to show Anne what a fool she has been in the past he starts seriously flirting with her two sisters-in-law (the sisters of her wife's brother) however it takes a near disaster to show that their feelings for one another haven't changed. Root plays Anne in beautifully - she is quiet, subdued, yet there is an elegance to her, and slowly her bloom returns.\nI also really liked the production - the cinematography struck me as less colourful and bouyant than other recent Austen films (Emma, Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility) - in fact the skies often feel low, or crowded with clouds, the costumes dark and rooms not quite so brightly lit. Well until Anne gets to Bath that is where her father's extravagance seems to be shown in endlessly bright rooms. I really liked the production but I know that some people found them too authentic to be really enjoyable - things like hair being not quite clean or the small dark and rather claustrophobic rooms at Lyme. It is definitely a matter of taste.\nA nicely unfolding film.;Quiet romance in Regency England

Jane Austin's stories are always a favorite, but I find this one to be especially appealing. The themes of debt, social status, and the conflicts within a woman with a sound mind in a society that doesn't know any better are good therapy.  The sound track itself is part of setting the mood for the quiet conversations that belie the powerful message. Definitely give it a try.  If you can't take the antiquity or the understatedness of the film, o.k.  As for me, I'm still watching it again and again--and loving it.";Strangely sedate and addicting
86;62.0;4.0;10.0;-65.98232394366195;Persuasion is perhaps Austen's most atmospheric novel. Her last completed novel, it is pervaded by melancholy. This film expertly captures the moods of the novel, by means of powerful performances from the leads, perfect detail and a pointed yet simple script.\n\nThe heroine, Anne Elliot, is an intelligent and gentle woman, whose sense and generous spirit are slighted by her vain and vacuous family. We see that, in spite of having been persuaded not to marry a poor sailor eight years previously, her steadfast nature eventually convinces the hurt and stubborn Wentworth, now a naval officer, to rekindle the romance after many obstacles have been overcome.\n\nThe production values are not lavish, but seem very real. Bath, Kellynch, Lyme and Uppercross Cottage are just as the audience can imagine Austen to have envisioned them. This film is a treat.;An atmospheric and true adaptation

I did not know the movie is out and this is the first time I've seen it and it was brilliant.  I always loved Pride and Prejudice, and Sense and Sensibility but I think I have a new favorite now and I do not think I will be confusing this story with anything else again. Amanda Root portrays everything with just her facial features, and body language - no words are spoken and there is no need for any. Ciarn Hinds also does very well as the previously thwarted lover. The two of them manage to create tension out of almost nothing.  Then there is Sophia Thompson, brilliant. Anne's father is also played very well.  Its nice to see an alternative to the usual physically blemish free Jane Austen.;Loved IT!
9;65.0;4.0;5.0;-660.5917408906881;"This movie, though it does end with a matrimonial  ""happily ever after"", invokes such a feeling of sadness, loneliness and regret, that when you think it was written by a 40 years old spinster ( in 1817,  40 was considered OLD )  on her death bed It's difficult to think of it as any other thing accept regretting what could have been.  Perhaps Austen had given her Heroin the life she would have wanted for herself, perhaps not, but the similarities between her and her protagonist made me look on this film very differently than other  novels.\n\nThis is a very nuanced and  slow adaptation of Austen's last novel, publishes after her death in 1817. Unlike other Austen's protagonists who are young, energetic and beautiful, Anne Elliot  is 27 years old, her youth and charms already fading away. In the terms of those times she is way passed her prime and is quickly entering the phase when she'll be considered a spinster unfit to be married. Ann has quietly resigned to spending the rest of her life in the service of her self centered father and sister, unappreciated and overlooked.  But Her quiet existence is completely shaken by a the return of Capt. Wentworth, whom she turned down 9 years ago, following advice from her friend, who thought he is not socially and financially suitable.  Wentworth is now a successful and wealthy officer, having made his fortune, and is sought after by much younger and prettier woman than Anne. Still - hopes and feelings Anne worked hard to abandon rise in her, despite herself. Capt. Wentworth, though cold and resenting at first, seems to have the same inner war with his feelings.\n\nThe power of this movie adaptation lies in the way it portrays the small, stifling country life of women in that class, much similar to how Austen herself lived  - limited to a small circle of friends and family, mundane and uneventful. We see how The whole production accentuate this mundane existence in the ultra realistic  way it presents the people and their life -  the actors appear ""au naturel""  without makeup,  ( like ordinary people look ) their hair kind of sweaty and disheveled. This could actually put you off, as some look like in dire need of a bath. I myself had the urge to grab a bottle of shampoo and a hose and to give them that bath. This strips the actors of all the glory and romanticism  we usually adore so much in period movies. We do not get stunning cinematography of mansions and gardens, but instead we see people as they were then, so much similar to the way we are now - their house is messy, the breakfast table not clear yet, their children running around annoying them.  We get a close look into their lives - there's a wonderfully comic scene in which Ann, visiting her married sister, listens on 3 separate occasions to her sister complaining about her in laws, the in laws complaining about her sister, and the sisters in law complaining about both. It's very amusing but at the same time you feel how horrible it must have been for people to be trapped in their dull lives this way, and appreciate why a simple visitor  or a stranger could stir so much excitement . On the other hand - Capt. Wentworth and his colleagues from the Navy are the opposite of confinement and dull. They have ventured beyond the strict social and financial hierarchy and have the power to alter their status and future. Their lives are free and full of possibilities. We see how envious Ann is of them  taking charge of your own fate, in a way, she, as a woman, can never take.\n\nCasting  of the actors goes hand in hand in the realistic feel of the movie. Both Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds ( playing Anne and Capt. Wentworth ) are not what you would  normally call pretty or handsome. Hinds, though Manly and quite impressive in his quiet way, is no dreamy Mr. Darcy, and Root certainly looks like a 30 year old  woman who gave up on herself, which gives their romance and happy ending so much more power and truth  than glossy Pride and prejudice. Love is not only the privilege of beautiful heroins and their gallant admirers, it is a miracle that happens to the most ordinary of people. We all have hope yet :)";"Cannot help but feel this movie should have been called ""Regret"""

When I first saw this adaptation of the film, I'd just hopped across the lobby of my local theatreplex from a happy screening of the 1995 Sense and sensibility adaptation. The opening scenes of this film apalled me. The projectionist was probably to blame for much of this, but even if it were projected flawlessly, i don't think i could have forgiven the director for not being Ang Lee. ;o) The opening is dark...overcast...the camera angles are shaky. Amanda Root's Anne is small, mousy, and meek - the complete antithesis of my beautiful, spirited Marianne Dashwood and my energetic, naive Emma Woodhouse. Since that first viewing, my opinion of the adaptation has completely changed. This story is remarkably satisfying if you give it a chance...much like Anne, who is a little too easy to dismiss when you're enraptured by Marianne. It has a quiet strength and an understated elegance you'll come to love, as the scenes and those in them become brighter, steadier, and more wonderful to watch as the film progresses.";This one really grows on you!

By the same token, this film version of Persuasion, while perhaps lacking the glamourous faces and costumes that adorn the flock of Austen films produced in the mid-1990's, is far and away the most faithfully adapted movie of the lot.  Nick Dear's script is beautifully spare, relying on the subtly expressive faces and gestures of a cast that is absolute perfection.  Filmed completely on-location, and using only natural light, every scene seems to have been painted directly from Miss Austen's imagination.;Best Austen film adaptation, bar none.

114;70.0;4.0;10.0;-703.9241139240505;"""Persuasion"" is one of Jane Austen's loveliest tales! Indeed, one full of hope and second chances. I think everyone can relate in one way or another, because we all have made decisions (which later we discovered were actually MISTAKES!) that were partly based on outside influences and opinions, and have lived to regret them. :`(\nThis is precisely the case with sweet-tempered Anne Elliot (Amanda Root), a not-so-young woman in her late twenties, who chose (in her younger years, when she was about nineteen) not to marry the man she truly loved, Frederick Wentworth, because he was thought to be ""unsuitable"" (by some anyway), for no other reason than his lack of fortune and connections! He was just a sailor, with nothing to offer- if LOVE and COMMITMENT are nothing (gee! the English were really shallow!). Her young, inexperienced heart was led, or ""persuaded"" if you will, to believe that his seeming lack of position in society would interfere with her happiness, and that opinion, which was not her own, no doubt contributed to her decision to turn down his proposal. As the years fly by, Anne is left to bear the burden of her choice. In her household she is made to feel less than appreciated, considered by this time to be an ""old maid"", she is not thought to be as pretty as her sister Elizabeth, and is generally neglected by her father (her mother died). Add to that, the fact that her family is teeter-tottering on the edge of financial ruin, and Anne has quite a load to bear! All her hope of finding happiness, love and contentment, is seemingly dead until... the once ""unsuitable"" sailor returns (this is eight years later mind you) as a Captain, of rather large fortune I might add! Captain Frederick Wentworth, charmingly played by Ciaran Hinds (gotta LOVE Ciaran!). He is yet unmarried, and is quite dashing, quite the talk of the town, quite the gentleman. As you can imagine, plenty of YOUNG ladies (younger, fresher than Anne) are more than willing to become Mrs. Wentworth. Could Anne be a consideration still? At her age? With their history? Just as Wentworth reappears in her life, and she is forced to look her past straight in the face, another man, young, handsome, seemingly wealthy Mr. Elliot (her cousin) also appears, and takes an interest in Anne! (When it rains it pours, huh!?) Could it be Mr. Elliot is right for her?\nAh, and here's where second chances come into play. What to do? What to do? Is it possible Wentworth could still love her after so many years? She has certainly never forgotten him. Could it be that her heart which was once ""persuaded"" to let him go, could now be ""persuaded"" to reach out to him again? Would HE be receptive after being rejected so many years ago, by the one he truly loved? Could he be ""persuaded"" to forgive her? Wouldn't YOU like to know? You have to see the movie! I won't give it away. But, let me just say it is quite rewarding, because too often in life (and even in movies/books too I suppose) those worthy of second chances do not get them, or, they are too blinded to recognize them when they come back around. Even worse, they may be too hesitant to go for it when they do recognize! Love though, ""persuades"" us to do what we never thought possible! It emboldens us, encourages us, and pushes us to go after our dreams!\nTo be honest, parts of the film are a tad... well, dull, but the overall theme, the storyline, allows you to endure them in order to see the outcome. Ciaran Hinds, and Amanda Root have a good chemistry. So often in the movie Anne has this wide-eyed, ""I think I'm about to faint"" expression on her face whenever she sees/talks to Wentworth... it is quite funny to see. And Wentworth's stares are enough to make any woman feel that way! This is a beautifully done adaptation, and you can't help but adore Ciaran Hinds! ""Persuasion"" is the perfect name for this story, because though our thoughts and opinions, and as a result our actions, can be influenced by others, it is really the heart that is the most persuasive influence! Really, each person must decide for THEMSELVES what is best and right for them. Love is never of little importance, but of the GREATEST, and a heart that has known true love will be persuaded to seek it again! All-in-all this movie is great! Why rent it when you can own it? I hope I have persuaded you (pun intended) to do so. Enjoy!! :-)";Second Chances

43;72.0;3.0;8.0;-512.824859967051;I am sorry to say that I was slightly disappointed with this adaptation of one of my best Jane Austen's novels. I heard so much praise of it so I was really excited to see it. But we all have different sensibilities and for me, the adaptation didn't manage to reproduce Anne's inner world and the depth of the love between Anne and Wentworth.\n\nFor me, the beauty of the book relies on the tension between Anne and Wentworth and on the looks that they can't help exchanging despite their long time of separation and despite Wentworth's resentment. Eight years ago, although Anne fell deeply in love with Wentworth, she was persuaded by her father and her deceased mother's friend to refuse his proposal, on account of Anne being too young and of Wentworth's lack of fortune. The story starts when Captain Wentworth returns to the country from the war with the intention of living peacefully and of finding a wife. They are to meet again unexpectedly as Anne's father, Sir Walter, is a heavy spender and the family has to let the family house, Kellynch Hall, to the Crofts who are closely related to Wentworth.\n\nThis love-story is really wonderful as it is all about undying love and about meeting again the person that you fell in love with so many years ago and in the case of Wentworth, meeting the woman you loved but broke your heart by rejecting you...These questions are still relevant today and that is what makes this story so original. Not only, Austen manages to create an incredible tension between Wentworth and Anne but also to describe to the perfection Anne's feelings of sadness, of solitude, of regret, of distress at seeing Wentworth for the first time.\n\nBut somehow, I didn't see any of that tension in the BBC film or Anne's real suffering. I am sorry to say so but I was not convinced by Amanda Root's performance as Anne Elliot. And it is not merely because she seems a little too old for the part, it is just that her face didn't display any emotion. I am probably shallow, but I need to see on the actress's face that Anne is very much affected by Wentworth's return. Unfortunately, I didn't feel any connections to this Anne. I really couldn't relate to her. I was not overwhelmed by the adaptation. I just watched it but I didn't feel the incredible urge to watch it again as I have felt for other period dramas like BBC North&South or BBC Pride &Prejudice.\n\nHowever, I put three stars because I thought that Ciaran Hinds was rather good in the part of Wentworth and I liked the settings for the film. I have watched the 1995 version only once and I will try to make the effort and watch it once more. But I've seen the 2007 ITV adaptation and in my heart, this one has already met my expectations. Even though it is not as faithful to the book as the 1995 one and despite the poor performances of some actors, the 2007 version has blown me away, simply because Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones are perfect in the parts of Anne Elliot and of Captain Wentworth!!!\n\n This BBC version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds is not a bad film in itself. But it is just not 'my' adaptation of the book. Just see it for yourself and maybe you will be 'persuaded' by it.;Not really persuaded...but that is just my opinion!

Persuasion tells the story of lost love renewed, and gives the viewer a taste of the grandness and degradation, of 19th century England. Diverse lifestyles of classes clash and we see the prejudices come forth when a lady: Anne Elliot( Root) rejects a dignified but penniless naval officer Capt. Wentworth (Hinds).\n\nEight years later, Anne's father's extravagant lifestyle catches up with him. And, Anne must face a truth-- that the man 'beneath her' was the man 'for her.'Obstacles arise, preventing Anne and Wentworth from declaring their feelings at first.

72;77.0;4.0;8.0;-82.9931578947368;The adaptation in many ways is faithful to the book certainly in intent. Persuasion is a relatively short book so the movie is not that long either.

Like many Austen adaptations I feel that the movies loose some of the richness in language and personal interactions. The scenery and Bath, as in any Austen adaptation, are breathtaking.\n\nI found Anne father (mr Walter Elliot) and her sisters, Elizabeth and Mary, just as annoying as I expected. Specifically Elizabeth is a real nasty creature.\nThe initial discomfort between Captain Wentworth and Anne is palatable. The scene where Anne first gets to meet the Musgroves in the big house again, is very funny, very Austen. Anne's friend Mrs Smith is so nice, would have loved to have seen those scenes expanded a bit.\n\nAll in all an enjoyable evening when watching this, but the book certainly wins hands down.;Very enjoyable adaptation
116;78.0;5.0;9.0;-199.19540816326526;I've seen my fair share of period romances and I think this movie just about blows the rest out the water.  It's certainly a great deal better than the over-hyped Sense and Sensibility (1995) and Pride and Prejudice (1996).  Everything about this movie is a thumb up.  I don't understand why people have problems with the cast, the story, or the music.  The leads are definitely not the regular Hollywood types, but that only makes them that much more believable.  I think this production is the finest showing of ensemble acting I've seen.  The script is a rather faithful rendering of Austen's novel (e.g., 90% of the dialogue comes straight from the book) and so I don't understand why some people say that they like Persuasion, the novel, but find problems with this part or that part of the story of the movie.  And the music is by the Romantic period composer, Chopin -- enough said.\nThis is not a movie to watch just once.  In this regard, it's like a book.  I watched it several times before I was able to pick up on how effectively the relationship between Anne and Frederick is juxtaposed against the various other relationships in the movie.\nI read the novel subsequent to watching the movie, and I found no jarring differences in the stories of the two mediums, with the exception of Mr. Elliot and Mrs. Smith.  The book presents Mr. Elliot far more critical light.  And I think Austen's alternate ending was very well integrated into the movie.  The brains behind the movie really did their homework in selecting the cast and condensing the novel to a script that still retains much of the nuances of the novel.;A Great Movie

I just accept that I often feel like Anne Elliot, and have been often treated like her by family members (""Ask Anne for advice?  Why?"").  It's also the most profound of her books, with themes of lost love and disappointment mixed in with the haunting images of Lyme.  This movie (a superb DVD transfer) simply astonishes on every level.  The acting is superb down to the smallest role (Mrs. Smith's nurse is a hoot!).  Amanda Root captures Anne's intelligence and lost bloom without ever begging our sympathy; she's too accomplished and intelligent a creature to enlist simple bathos.  Her transformation is so subtle, from sad soon-to-be spinster to woman in love, and yet so complete that she literally seems to come alive right before our eyes.  Ciaran Hinds is a very likeable Captain Wentworth, a true man's man but with enough sensitivity to love his male friends and not shrink from saying so--a true sign of masculine strength and security.  Sir Walter is a vain, abrasive fellow, but in the hands of Corin Redgrave remains watchable and funny; Fiona Shaw is a marvel in her few scenes as Sophie Croft, Wentworth's sister, and it's always a treat to see Judy Cornwell away from the low class frump she played so well on ""Keeping Up Appearances"".  Great, spare music and gorgeous cinematography complement director Roger Michell's sure hand--he never steps wrong in this splendid adaptation. Though 1995's ""Pride & Prejudice"" is a classic also, with Emma Thompson's ""Sense & Sensibility"" not far behind, this one stands a bit taller than the others, like Anne Elliot herself.";My Favorite Austen Becomes My Favorite Austen.

The actor portraying Anne's father is a case in point. Maybe if I were from England I would better understand him.

87;82.0;4.0;8.0;-274.87511049723753;"Jane Austen's Persuasion, her last great novel, comes to life in great perfection in this 1995 film version. Starring Amanda Root as Anne Elliot and Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth, this version of the classic is certainly admirable in both performance and faithfulness to the work itself. While the story is both a satire and a drama, the pervading question that surfaces is: what can we do when we let someone important slip away from us? For Anne Elliot, she must not only live in the present, but deal with a past love when Captain Wentworth resurfaces in her life years after their failed love.\n\nOne of the great things about this version is not only its succinctness, but the great effort by the cast. While the movie is barely over one hour and a half long, it still keeps much of the relevant plot within the script. There is not a sense of dragging the story around; we get right into the main issues of the work and the story shifts rather quickly. The cast itself was also commendable-for instance, Anne's sister, Elizabeth, who is played by Pheobe Nichols, comes across perfectly as someone who is a bit snobbish and only concerned with the issue of class and reputation for both herself and her sister.\n\nAnother successful aspect of the film is the ability to depict accurately the social values that are so crucial to the book's relevancy. For example, we really get a true look at how much family pressure made a difference in determining marital values, as is demonstrated in the case of Anne Elliot and her family's wishes that leave her feeling guilty and frustrated years later.\n\nThe most essential aspect of filming a classic is to bring forth the vitality of the book, and this one does this successfully. We see the story of a woman who must try to put her family's wishes and other's interferences aside in order to find what is truly essential to her well-being.  Anne must also fight through the frustrations of others interfering in something that is paramount to her own life-love.";Successful adaptation of Austen's work

139;85.0;5.0;9.0;-429.0290909090909;"A young woman, Anne, is persuaded by her close friend and surrogate mother, Lady Russell, to reject a young sea-man's offer of marriage because he is poor and without prospects. Eight years later, now a prosperous  ship's captain, he comes home and is looking for a wife.\nThis must be the  definitive adaption of Jane Austen's novel Persuasion. I cannot imagine any  future adaption surpassing it. Every actor is the very embodiment  of his  or her character. Jane Austen, I think, would have recognised them all.  Amanda Root is particularly good as Anne with her large expressive eyes.  She is exactly the way I imagined her to be. And Fiona Shaw as Mrs Coft and  Susan fleetwood  as Lady Russell are both excellent.\nHowever, I have some  slight doubt about Ciaran Hinds who played Captain Wentworth. He certainly  looked the part, though why they allowed him to appear in his first scene,  when he should have been at his most impressive, wearing a  filthy looking  top-coat and a scruffy cravat I've no idea. But, as a ship's captain,  Wentworth should have been portrayed as a strong man  with  an easy,  confident manner and Ciaran Hinds it seems to me was a little lacking in  that respect. At the dinner table when he was flirting with the Musgrove  sisters, Louisa and Henrietta, and should have been at his most charming,  he seemed to have some slight awkwardness and impediment in his  speech.\nAnd the scene at the recital when he storms off in a jealous rage  was a bit over the top. A good man, even in a jealous rage, would never  treat the woman he loves so unfeelingly, particularly after she has shown  she cares by abandoning the other man and chasing after him. It was  childish behaviour and heroic ship's captains are not normally prone to  childish behaviour. But this scene is false to the novel and falsifies both  the character of Wentworth and Anne. In the novel she does not chase after  him; no woman at that time would have dreamt of doing such a thing in a  public place. It would have been unthinkable. He comes to talk to her and  it in only when  Mr Elliot approaches to urge her  to return to her seat  that he allows his jealous feelings to show and, saying goodbye, leaves  abruptly. But not in anger. More in sorrow than anger.\nThe novel of  course is much richer than the dramatisation could ever be in its allotted  time span. In the scene where Wentworth hands Anne into the carriage  alongside Admiral Croft and his wife, we are left to infer Anne's feelings.  In the novel, Jane Austen devotes nearly a whole page to expressing those  feelings.\nThe film has a very moving ending. It made me cry. But then I  cry whilst reading any of  Jane Austen's novels or indeed whilst watching  any good adaption. The very best, the unbeatable dramatisation, of course,  is the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice - though even that is not  without its flaws.";Love lost and Refound

This Jane Austen story is very sweet and moving and the heroine is particularly  worthy.  Amanda Root did a wonderful job playing this role.  Ciaran Hinds  did very nicely as the suitor, but his character doesn't shine quite as  well as in the book.  Overall, a pleasant and touching film.\nSome of the  negative reviewers below compare this film with Emma and Sense and  Sensibility and if you are looking for high-gloss, Hollywood Austen, then  you might agree with their opinions.  But this is not a high-budget movie,  and as enjoyable as those movies are, this one gives another perspective  into Jane Austen's world which is probably more faithful.  To true fans of  Austen, this film will hold its own.;Well done adaptation of an Excellent Austen novel
102;87.0;4.0;8.0;-459.6032014388488;Although I have read several Jane Austen books and then saw the movie, that was not the case with Persuasion.  I didn't know the story and so didn't know what to expect.\nI watched it the first time and was a little let down because at first it really DID seem a little boring as other viewers have mentioned in their reviews.  But then on a rainy Sunday afternoon (isn't that the best times to watch romantic movies??) I watched it again and LOVED it this time!  I think I had just missed a lot of the subtleties the first time around and think that must be the case with the viewers who submitted poor reviews...they just missed all the undercurrents and subtleties.\nThe first time I saw the movie I did not see the handsomeness or beauty in the Captain or Anne but by the end of the second viewing I was in love with the Captain and finally noticed that although Anne is mousy, she is the prettiest female in the movie.  Especially at the end when they both were just glowing.  Is that glow, especially on Anne's face, just a good makeup artist's trick or fine acting...or just a projection of how you, yourself feel about the characters by the end of the movie??  All the characters are really not very attractive looking in this movie, but I loved that because it seemed mover REAL.  How many times have you heard how beautiful some historic figure (Anne Boleyn, Marie Antionette??) was supposed to be, then saw a picture of them and thought...uggg!  Different time periods have different ideals of beauty.  From pictures that I have seen of this time period, the women really DID look like this, not like so-called modern beauties like Gweneth Paltrow as she was in Emma.\nA couple of the scenes that I absolutely adore are where Anne is at the opera.  She is there with Mr Elliot, who wants Anne also, but only for what a marriage with her can do for him.  She is ignoring Mr Elliot, who is trying to tell Anne of his feelings and intentions, because she can see that Captain Wentworth is leaving because he can see what is going on between them.  She runs to stop the Captain from leaving begging him to stay which he will not due because of his jealousy of Mr Elliot, who is also standing there with them having this very passionate conversation.  Everyone is watching them instead of the singer!  Little, meek, spinsterish Anne now has TWO men wanting her! The other scene I love is the one where the Captain is coming over to ask Anne's father if he can marry Anne.  Her self-absorbed sister who seems to despise Anne and lords over her, and almost treats her as a servant throughout the movie, actually tells her to try not to monopolize the Captain's time when he arrives...probably so that she may have a chance at him. And when the Captain asks for Anne's hand in marriage, her father is actually in disbelief that it is Anne the Captain wants.\nSo, if you watch this the first time and didn't like it, watch it again and you will be very pleasantly surprised.;Watch it a second time

Some scenes just did not make sense...almost as if some part of the story was missing. I can count the number of scenes with Anne and Wentworth together and worst still, in the few scenes where they did appear together, they barely spoke to each other, until the tail end of the movie. If we (the audience) were to gain some inkling of their feelings from their body language during these scarce occasions, then that too was sorely lacking. I have not read the book yet but I am a great fan of the author. This adaptation left me with a bad taste and no longer wanting to read the book. If it were not for the several reviews I've read about what the book is supposed to be about, and the praise in such reviews, I'd have just resigned to being perhaps the only Jane Austen fan who never read Persuasion. I don't think this adaptation truly conveyed the essence of the story and indeed, I was very disappointed with this particular adaptation.;Disappointed

It was a good thing I did, because without doing that there would have been no way to discover what was going on or where the plot would lead.\n\nIn short, the hero of the story returns to find the woman who'd refused to marry him several years before still unmarried and with few prospects.  After some awkward encounters they're thrown back together and the spark returns to their relationship.  Apparently, this is not far-removed from Jane Austen's own life story and maybe why she was able to write about it so well.  Jane never married but her heroine in this story does and may go on to live happily ever after, last time we see them aboard his ship.\n\nThis DVD is worth having and re-viewing, but buyers shouldn't expect a ""Pride & Prejudice,"" or even an ""Emma.""  Whoever did the film editing removed about 30 to 45 minutes more than they should have to make a complete story.  Acting, scenery, and character diversity are fine.

18;93.0;5.0;5.0;-260.1255813953488;"This ""Persuasion"" is the standard by which all other adaptations of britlit should be judged. Amanda Root is flawless as the faded and resigned Anne who has already accepted her fate as spinster aunt and put-upon companion to her uncaring family. Ciaran Hinds wonderfully brings to life Captain Wentworth who made his fortune during the Napoleonic sea battles and is now ready to settle down. They are both tragic victims of the standards of the time,  separated while in their early twenties by class consciousness and lack of money (his). But the Fates have destined that they meet again years later and despite the wounded pride of the Captain, and Anne's fragile feelings that threaten to overcome her at a moment's notice, they do find each other once more.\n\nThis is a movie about hidden passions: about Anne's repressed and fragile feelings, and about Frederick's channeled passions and wounded pride which have become duty to king and country.  Jane Austen's brilliance lay in using words to imply the bubbling cauldron of emotions beneath the surface of good manners and this movie shows these passions in a rapid glance, a trembling hand on a chair, a guarded comment. But beneath the happy story is the sadness we feel when we realize that fictional Anne is just one of thousands of real young women who had been destined to remain spinsters at home, burdens to be tolerated but not loved. Anne is lucky and we know it.\n\nThe mastery of this film (including its acting, costumes, lighting, direction, and even its slow pace) is seeing ghostly Anne change from a pale shadow that haunts her family home, wearing washed out colors, going through her days unloved and unwanted, to a young woman who literally wakes up to life and love, a bloom in her cheeks as she herself blossoms into the passionate woman she always has been under her sadness. She alone of her family is deserving of this monumental and deep love and we are happy for her.";"""I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late..."""

I had never read the book and I didn't know the story, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie-- almost as much as Pride and Prejudice!  As with all of Jane Austen's works, I could barely keep up with the names of the people and families involved in the story, which is imperative to understanding the story as it unfolds, so pay close attention to the names of the characters as they come into the film.  Amanda Root does a splendid job of playing Anne, who is not a traditional beauty, but who is loved by several men for her intensity, intelligence, and of course her golden heart.  Ciaran Hinds stole my heart!  When he confessed that his love for Anne had never died, I was jumping up and down with happiness.  Or perhaps it was jealousy...  He is handsome and, of course, a perfect gentleman.  The characters we love to hate also get the chance to spice up this story.  Anne's father is terrible.  He only cares about appearances.  He endlessly talks about the women and men of his acquaintance and all of their physical flaws.\nThe costumes, old-fashioned homes, and acting in this film are all superb.  I liked this movie even better the second time through, probably because I could associate each character more readily with his or her name.  Rumors and gossip make so much more sense when you know who people are talking about...  I loved this movie because it made my heart leap for joy as Anne and Captain Wentworth fell in love all over again, and I also loved it because Anne was so easy to love as a character.;Absolutely superb!

Both Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds are very attractive and look like REAL people--not ""Hollywood Movie Stars"".  You can believe they were people Jane Austen knew personally.\n\nThe supporting cast is equally exceptional.  Sophie Thompson's portrayal of Mary Musgrove is spot on.  (I reread the book after watching this DVD again, and the scene when Anne goes to visit Mary at the beginning of the movie is almost word for word Jane Austen.)

But she was once a pretty girl and she's also supposed to have a sense of humour, and have enough manners to hide her own feelings in a social setting.\nAmanda Root's Anne in this movie is seriously plain/unattractive, and one can't imagine how she could ever be considered pretty 8 years ago with her long nose, plain eyes, and indeterminate jawline. But that's not the problem.\nThe problem is that in every scene in which Captain Wentworth's name is mentioned, her eyes go all big, her jaw drops, and she goes all pale and frozen and can't function in a social setting. She becomes a total dumbwit. When Wentworth's name is mentioned, Anne is supposed to be stricken, barely functioning mentally, yet also hiding it beneath her manners and continuing to attend to others in conversation. Furthermore, Amanda Root's Anne doesn't show any conversational ability until she's talking with Mr. Elliot in Bath. A little late in the movie, isn't it?\nThe Anne portrayed by Ms. Firbanks in the 1971 version of Persuason is at least 10 years too old, but I preferred that Anne's social adeptness. Even when stricken, she tried to hide it and spare the people around her from being worried about her, and acted graciously.

The story is full of distinctive characters and every actor does a wonderful job of capturing them.  At their center is Amanda Root as Anne Elliot who slowly, quietly, hopefully escapes a bleak and nearly friendless solitude to recapture the ""bloom"" she lost as eight years of broken hearted loneliness withered her away.  Ciaran Hinds is handsome, hard-hearted,  dashing and tender as Frederick Wentworth.  All of the supporting players are a delight.  Sophie Thompson and Phoebe Nicholls are  Anne's insufferable snobbish sisters, Simon Russell Beale is comical as Anne's long-suffering, clueless brother-in-law,  Corin Redgrave is hilariously narcissistic and pompous and Fiona Shaw plays Mrs Croft with easy elegance.  Also love the way the film looks,  not so highly polished as ""Sense and Sensibility"" or ""Emma"" , as though there was a lot less money to work with and the happy result is that the audience gets a truer picture of a certain kind  of early 19th century life in England.  Too many great scenes and pieces of dialogue to single out but watch for: the faces of the servants and local folk as the Elliots depart for Bath, hypochondriac Mary on the couch,  Anne greeting Mr. Musgrove,  Mrs. Croft describing her travels to Mrs. Musgrove, the massive oak on the ""long walk,""  Anne and Frederick's voices intermingling as she reads his pleading letter.

They were both Victorians by birth and temperament. My grandpa reading his newspaper and puffing on his pipe.  My grandma lost in her needlepoint.

My boisterous presence interrupting their quiet contentment: the murmured conversation between them both and the cheery talk with welcome visitors.

It's fairly faithful to the novel, it offers lush cinematography, and just about every performance is remarkable. My favorite is the ever-brilliant Sophie Thompson as Ann's whiny hypochondriac younger sister. It's possible that people who haven't read Austen's contemplation on the fate of aristocrats without money and a spinster of 27 won't love the movie as much as I do.

It is a definite must-have to round-out your Austen collection--not a waste of money by a long shot.\nThe overall mood of the film is hushed and a little brooding, but not boring in the least.  A caveat--any Austen fan will certainly endure, but non-Austen companions may not have the patience.  Try having a Jane Austen party with your most refined friends, as this one may not fly with a wood-chopping, motorcycle riding husband or boyfriend.\nThe camera angles and lighting are reminiscient of other British productions, markedly different from ""American-made"" films. For instance, the rooms are not always well-lit, but this is more realistic to the era of candle-lighting and actually enhances the viewers understanding of the setting.  As well, the camera techniques appear a little distracting to the average viewer, such as remaining fixed upon the actors' faces a little longer than ""American"" films and, but this is useful because it helps the viewer to feel what the characters are feeling.  I'd have to say that this film is shot in a method that is somewhere between a stage-play and a typical movie.\nThe costumes and settings are authentic and believable.  Every attention has been paid to period details and never does one think that it is all a hoax, I promise.  Nothing is worse than seeing a telephone pole in the background or asphalt roads when you're enjoying a period film!\nAmanda Root, who plays the main character of Anne Elliot, is an excellent actress and is very convincing as the broken-hearted spinster whose undeserving family cruelly mistreats her. She has a unique brand of beauty and elegance and pulls off her performance impeccably.\nAs the story unfolds it seems that Anne is destined to live a lonely life forever, until someone from her past unexpectedly enters the picture.......there are some surprises, but ultimately a satisfying, semi-vengeful ending.

We all know that true love will win out in Austen but the glory of her writing was in the details of how that love is accomplished in the face of overwhelming obstacles as personified in unforgettable personages who create unbelievable situations (the proud and the prejudiced if you prefer).  Mary the hypochrondiac sister is a character for all ages; Sir Michael Redgrave, in my mind, will always be remembered for his full-frontal face camera shot, looking like a nineteenth century Donald Trump as the word is spit from his small mouth: ""RETRENCH?""

Many critics say that this novel was written in a new style and much of the situation and places are highly connected with Austen's own life so involves much more mature emotions ,and if we consider that this is one of the oldest protagonists of  Austen's novel and has suffer a vast deal more than any other character, it is absolutely rational to expect a much more serious movie with deep ""hidden"" feelings in which the audience can understand and connect with Anne's feelings.\nI absolutely think that Amanda Root's performance is superior, it has credibility, and most of all she is capable of expressing  the love, and passion that she feels for Cap.

The two play off one another beautifully.  All the actors do a truly magnificent job.  The settings work well, and the final scene continues to delight with surprise.

Wentworth in front of the whole concert audience as they watch...but now I like seeing just how little she cared about others' opinions and how impulsive she becomes toward the end of the movie; I didn't like how they emphasize Mr. Elliot and Mrs. Clay's complicity...but now after thinking about it, this *is* implied strongly in the novel.  One of the best parts of the movie, however, are the significant looks exchanged between Anne and Capt. Wentworth -- one of the best happening when Anne is discussing love and loss with Capt. Benwick.  It is so subtle but so heavy with meaning.  It is not so surprising to me to find out that both Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds have acted with the Royal Shakespeare Company as they both do superb jobs here.";I can't stop watching this movie...
119;112.0;3.0;7.0;-276.0681147540983;Don't let my rating of 3 stars mislead anyone...this is a good movie. There is no fault to be found with the story line. The movie sticks fairly close the the original Jane Austen novel, while taking a few, acceptable, creative liscences with the plot. It is wonderfully cast (almost perfectly cast to be precise) and it is shot beutifully. The scenery is inspiring and the costumes are elegant without being overdone. However, I have some complaints about the quality of this production...needless to say, this story deserved better then what was done to it. First of all, the story starts so slow that I could barely keep my interest (I find this a screenplay error, the original novel doesn't start out so dully and slowly). Luckily, the plot picks up after about half an hour and the rest of the story was wonderful, romatic, and interesting. Secondly, the sound on the entire procuction is terrible. In almost every key point in the plot I had to turn the volume to the maximum just to try and hear what the characters were saying, and even then I could barely understand them. During the climax of the movie, which involves one of the most moving and romantic love letters ever written, two voices read it at the same time, making the letter incomprehensible. I had to rewind the video and watch it at least three times before I understood what the letter even said...poorly done. For a movie where dialogue is the driving force for the movie more attention should have been given to sound quality.  The good news is that I was at least interested enough in the movie to be drawn into reading the book, which was a million times better and a lot more interesting so I must give that credit where credit is due. My basic opinion of this movie is that it was a good idea and well done from the standpoint of the story, but more time should have been given to certain production details. The lack of such attention only frustrated me as a viewer when it was clear the movie was a good one.;Lovely to see, difficult to understand

After watching the DVD, I must say that I am still unsatisfied with the performance by the leading actress Amanda Root. As many reviewers have said before, she's totally unattractive no matter it's in the beginning or in the end where some reviewers have said that she has ""blossomed"" or ""transformed"". Beside her apparance, her acting skill was not impressive, either. She just had her eyes wide open at almost every shot. As to Capt. Wentworth played by Ciaran Hinds, I have to say that he's totally charming and handsome. He steals the show. Whenever he appeared in any scene he's the focus. No question asked. I love watching Jane Austin's movies very much. I have BBC's Pride and Prejudice, BBC's Emma, Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility and I just need to add the Persuasion to my collection. The story itself was extremely romantic. The casting and the set are wonderful, too. However, I just can't help but wandering if Anne Elliot was portrayed by a slightly younger, more eye-pleasing actress, then this movie might have been my favorite Jane Austin movie of all time. Hope there will be another adaptation (maybe on the big screen) in the future.";Almost my favorite Jane Austin movie ever

When I saw it in DVD it was an easy decision to add this to a collection worth archiving.  The DVD is far superior in audio quality to the VHS. One can actually understand the rapid style of speech and the words are far clearer in the important moments where the plot line is revealed.\nIt is a sweet story of a ""spinster"" who is forced to bypass two offers of marriage by an interferring socialite neighbor who has placed herself in the advisor role since the death of the girl's mother.  Ann Elliott is pale, withdrawn and very sad as she watches her life pass her by, lost in regrets over refusing the hand of a man she truly loved.  The socialite wants her to marry a cousin who has another agenda entirely.\nThe story unfolds as her lost love, Captain Wentworth, reappears in her life and one watches a very gifted actress, who is a member of the Royal Shakespearean Theater in England, literally come to life again as she reawakens to the love lost and the promise to regain it.  Watching her transform from drab to glowing is simply wonderful in this engaging story of the eternal quest for love and being loved.";Delightful

Being 19th Century people the simmer slowly over events that would overwhelm and excite modern day folk and the characters are polite and understated.\n\n Root and Hinds are pivotal in driving this drama with accuracy and excellence but the nature of their simmering stoicism has perhaps made this an overlooked drama. It is beautiful in it's comments on the coming good of the human conditon and the historical placement and projection is stunning.

27;117.0;5.0;5.0;-435.3519291338583;"Amazon reviewers in noticeably large numbers are wholly in the right for lavishly praising this BBC version of Jane Austen's final novel. Of the spate of Austen adaptations released in the past two decades, it's arguable that this particular one is the finest. First of all, it takes striking advantage of TV's being so good a medium for the adaptation of manners novels. Pretty much void of grand vistas, this version focuses on expressive close-ups, raised eyebrows, revelatory tete-a-tetes, and the tinkle of teacups. Amanda Root is wonderfully adept at showing us the painful consequences of Anne Elliot's refusal of Captain Wentworth years earlier. Her face in the early scenes is one with an appropriately faded bloom, and her unhappiness is signaled through her nervous, furtive glances and the almost cringing manner in which she enters rooms. She is the consummate solitary heroine of this potentially tragic, mature Austen novel. At home, she experiences what has been called the tyranny of neglect, being regularly passed over or unexpectedly offered to others for ""use"" by her self-absorbed father and older sister. The tinkle of teacups in these family scenes reveals to the shrewd observer that some of the hands holding the cups might as well have been claws and the noses snouts. Jane Austen clearly in this film is revealed as a specialist both in domestic humor and domestic horror. With the exception of Anne herself, the other Elliots inadvertently illustrate the truth in G.B.Shaw's witty paradox that ""the human family is the greatest instrument of torture the race has so far devised.""\n\nThe Lyme scenes of the story are especially well-handled. A combination of the fresh sea air and a growing restoration in the returned Wentworth's good opinion combine to change Amanda Root's face to one of bright-eyed hope ""after all hope has been lost."" Also, the encounters here between Anne and the heartbroken Captain Benwick have been successfully dramatized and are moving in their rich irony. Having lost his beloved Phoebe, but ignorant of Anne's own lost love, Benwick tells Anne she cannot understand what he has lost. She responds beautifully and powerfully with the quiet rejoinder, ""Oh, but I can.""\n\nIf the film has any flaws, I would say they lie in the denouement which is truncated and rather abrupt and in the characterization of Sir Walter and his oldest daughter Elizabeth. These two Elliots are too monotonously drawn in their repetitive self-absorbtion, the father caring only for looks and the daughter for rank. On the other hand, Mary, the hypochondriac Elliot middle sister, played with great skill by Sophie Thompson, is a wholly successful characterization, being more than one-dimensional in her awfulness and thus more unwittingly comical - she's a snob and doting mother as well as a hypochondriac. But these flaws, after all, are relatively small ones when taken in conjunction with the understanding and respect for the novel this adaptation shows and for the excellence of the acting in evidence throughout.";"""Cinderella of Kellynch Hall"""
136;118.0;4.0;7.0;-319.0854999999999;"Although it does not compete with the elegance of the theatrical releases of ""Sense & Sensibility"" and ""Emma,"" this 1996 BBC Films production of ""Persuasion"" has its own place in the Jane Austen revival of the past decade.  With Anne Elliot (Amanda Root) and Captain Wentworth (Ciarn Hinds) we have the longest suffering set of lovers in all of Austen's domestic novels.  Eight years early Anne had been persuaded by a snobbish friend of the family to reject Wentworth as a suitor since he was a young naval officer with no prospects.  But now the financial fortunes of both parties are reversed, with the Elliots on the verge of bankruptcy and Wentworth a successful captain in the war against Napoleon, but their feelings for each other are unchanged.  It is just a question of when the two lovers will figure this out.\nRoot and Hinds, both members of the Royal Shakespeare Company, bring the requisite maturity to their roles.  Anne Elliot is the quintessential Austen old maid, with a resigned acceptance of her fate and an inherent dignity in the face of life's little quirks that makes the happy ending all the more enjoyable.  This is one of those steady, unremarkable performances where you really forget Root is acting.  She simply is Anne.  Hinds has a marvelous scene where he puts aside the requirements of polite society to tell off the woman who thwarted his happiness.  As is a requirement with all BBC period piece productions, the supporting cast is superb, especially Sophie Thompson as Anne's hypochondriac sister Mary (this is another one of those Austen literary families where the heroine is the only worthwhile one in the lot).\nTo me the most intriguing part of this adaptation is that it manages to incorporate both Austen's original and revised endings for the novel.  I must admit that I prefer the revised ending because for once she has the reconciliation of the two lovers be the result of one of them having the courage to tell the other one how they feel (albeit in a letter rather than face to face).  This was certainly quite different from Austen's usual tack of them accidentally learning about their true feelings for each other (e.g., ""Pride and Prejudice"").  I always considered this to be evidence of Austen's maturity as a writer, but unfortunately the work was published posthumously.";Solid BBC Production incorporating BOTH of Austen's endings

The actors fit their characters so exquisitely that I could not imagine anyone else playing the roles, and certainly there are none that could come close to Amanda Root and Ciaran Hand playing the leads.  Their respective transformations from rundown to radiant, and aloof to passionate were subtle and spot on, and completely matched my personification of the characters as I read the book.  I watch the final scenes every time I need a romantic ""high"" - Wentworth realizing Anne still loves him has he hears her say that women love the longest when there is no hope, and Anne reading his amazing letter that brings her total joy then madly trying to be alone with him to say ""yes"".

Also, Root portrays Anne Elliot as a more mature and maturing woman, yet one who reveals strong emotions (her surprise at encountering WEntworth, for instance)with a great deal of subtlety and dignity (unlike the PBS version which has Anne Elliott running up and down the streets of Bath, unescorted, breathlessly searching for Wentworth). Finally, this version (the one with Amanda Root)incorporates lavish cultural detail--candelabras attached to music stands, for instance, to remind the viewer that all was not (fluorescently) illuminated during the Regency era.;Great adaptation

There were things one simply did not speak aloud; decorum and restraint were the rule. I felt the actors rose extremely well to the challenge: their gestures, expressions, and tone conveyed effectively the meanings the characters couldn't say outright, given their time and place.\n\nA particular treat was seeing how the dialogue allowed both Anne and Captain Wentworth communicate their feelings ""between the lines"": Captain Wentworth speaking of Captain Benwick and Phoebe, says, ""A man does not recover from such a devotion to such a woman..."" and *clearly* he wants Anne to understand that he is describing his own feelings for her. Similarly, Anne sends a message to Captain Wentworth when she speaks with Captain Harville by the window: ""It would not be in the nature of any woman who truly loved...""";Need to understand British Culture in the 1800's

One of my favorite college professors had a sentence on a piece of paper on his office door.  It said, ""I'd rather be reading Jane Austen.""  In the early 1800s, before psychology was a science, Jane Austen, an unmarried young woman, had the audacity to publish her thoughts on the workings of the inner mind.\n\nThis is an excellent movie adaptation of Austen's final novel, a novel she wrote when her health was failing and she probably knew she had little time left to express what she had to say.  Reading the cast list for this movie is a ""Who's who"" of great actors:  Amanda Root, Ciaran Hinds, Corin Redgrave, Sophie Thompson, etc.  The acting is terrific.  There are certain movies that are so good that I don't wish to comment too much on the movie itself because it is not improved by my commentary.  Other movies in that category include Emma Thompson's Sense & Sensibility (to which Ms. Thompson added many of her own sensibilities to the screenplay).\n\nAusten's characters are often caught up in an internal dialogue, constantly re-evaluating the decisions of the past.  In Austen's era, these thoughts were made more desperate and consequential because romantic love could only be found in one other person.  Her characters are constantly jockeying to gain power, stature, & wealth through social, exclusivity contracts.  For Austen's characters, the one person is usually separated by distance, time, or rules of society.  Austen comments on how the mind seems to concentrate on the imprinted loves of the past (See Spielberg's ""A.I."").  Her heroines tend to think there was a person in their past whose character so well matched their own, that to be reunited would bring some fulfilment.  And in her novels, often the two are combined in the end, defying the odds and rewarding their moral behavior and steadfastness.  The reader can see that the two are not just imprinted on each other;  rather, there are many good reasons why their chemistry works well.\n\n""Captain Wentworth . . . You have an extraodinary ability to discompose my friend sir.""\n\nThis is true.  The book is titled ""Persuasion"".  It is not titled ""Control"".  The protagonists in the movie argue regularly with the intent to be persuasive, not to be controlling - and that is an essential distinction.\n\n""Perhaps you have not been in Bath long enough to learn to enjoy these parties they give.""\n\n""They mean nothing to me.  Those who hold them believe the theatre to be beneath their dignity, but I am no card player.""\n\n""No.  You never were, were you?""\n\nJane Austen, as a young woman was a genius ahead of her time, and in some ways is still ahead of our time.  Great authors and artists find a way to speak to their generation in a way that both respects the status quo, yet somehow uses metaphor or narrative to look on the status quo's priorities from a new perspective.  For example, Willa Cather's ""My Antonia"" may be one of the first great works of lesbian literature (although most people would probably disagree with me).  That book certainly is not written from an ordinary male ""voice"", even if the narrator is male.  Similarly, Jane Austen questioned every social construct around her and tried to illustrate the conflicts that the social systems created against the natural, moral drives of the human psyche.  Her debate has fascinated us for hundreds of years.\n\nThe movie is not about ""old, boring people who lived hundreds of years ago.""  Like all her novels, this movie is robust and a worthwhile social discourse today.\n\nPlease comment, express feedback, or suggest related works.";Persuasion

Anne Elliot (Amanda Root) was in love with a common man and was forced to give him up - leaving her so many years later classified as a 'Plain Jane' and 'Old Maid'. Amanda looks the part and acts is perfectly.\n\nUnexpectantly he returns, no longer a commoner but a Captain - Captain Wentworth (Ciaran Hinds). But he shows no interest in Anne, but the younger prettier girls.\n\nOf course, he can't deny his true feelings forever and has to make a move or leave.\n\nMy only slight disappointment was that there is no bonus on the DVD, but I recommend it all the same.;Great casting = Great film

The  characters never engage one's interest, and the influence of Anne's friend  is underplayed so much as to leave the viewer wondering why Austen titled  her book ""Persuasion"".  Primarily missing is the tension  between characters and subtle interplay that make Austen's novels such  page-turners.  Austen is a master at showing the social complexity and  background of the early 1800s which this movie mainly misses.";Dissuasion
83;142.0;5.0;5.0;-29.030232558139488;Well, they've done it again--even Jane Austen would be proud.  The movie's adherence to the book is refreshing but the movie adds so much more.  Hinds and Root have a great electric charge which makes them a joy to watch.  The movie does such an excellent job of making the audience wait and wait and wait for any sight or word of the Captain that we truly feel the plight of our poor heroine.  Her life is one of domesticity and sequestered emotions.  On the surface all is placid, but beneath beats a tortured heart and mind.  Through the movie's smooth pace, its music, scenery, and script we are able to feel these emotions as Anne does and so we all go on a journey together.;Picture Perfect

Strong, yet soft in the heart, this is another love story with a woman, "" poorly chosen for the part"". The story is lacking some connection between the two, but you won't mind if your a lover of Ciaran.";Another Ciaran Hinds Great!
106;144.0;3.0;5.0;-308.9749999999999;"First of all, if you haven't read this book, I strongly recommend that you DO NOT see this movie.  I don't think it would give you a very good impression of what is one of my favorite books.  The pacing is wrong, it  manages to jump around and drag on seemingly without going anywhere at the same time.  I also think that they expect you to infer quite a bit about the characters and events prior to the movie, but don't do a very good job of setting them up.  Also, the sound quality of the dialogue isn't very good. Basically, if you don't already care about the characters, you still won't; if you don't already have some idea of the plot, it will be confusing and move incredibly slowly.\nIf you have already read the book, I would suggest seeing this movie, it is a decent adaptation (not as good as both recent Emmas and the most recent P&P, but to each their own).  As far as I can remember, the two most major changes made were that the alternate ending (Wentworth speaking on the behalf of the Admiral regarding Kellynch) was added, and Mrs. Smith's story was changed to be much, much shorter and more straightforward.  I think that both of these changes worked fairly well.  What I couldn't stand about this version was its drab personality and horrible miscastings.  Ciaran Hinds plays a dull (and unattractive) Capt. Wenworth.  Amana Root is almost always too passive and serious as Anne (why is she such a good companion? why does everyone like her so much?) and spends half the movie staring sad and confused into the camera.  She never gets her second ""bloom"" either.  Mrs. Smith is laughably goofy.  Elizabeth slouches and chews loudly and snorts and isn't at all elegant.  Still, I think the Musgroves and Crofts are played well, as are Harville and Benwick.  Also, the letter scene was completely ruined for me...they both read it aloud, but not perfectly in unison.\nOverall, I gave this movie three stars because even though it's not done at all how I picture it, and is very unclear in parts, it still tells the story faithfully for those who have read it, and it's such a great story....for all of its shortcomings I've still seen this 3 times.";Decent adaptation...ONLY SEE IF YOUVE READ THE BOOK
108;145.0;5.0;5.0;-192.2102527075812;"Jane Austen's wonderful novels have been adapted many times over and many recent adaptations have been excellent. ""Persuasion"" is one of those heartwarming and romantic love stories that you'll want to revisit again and again.\nThis is a story of Anne Eliott, second daughter to a debt-ridden baronet.  She fell in love with the dashing and handsome Frederick Wentworth at age 19 but was persuaded to break the engagement because of his limited prospects.  She is, after all, from a noble family while he has a far humbler background.\n9 years later, Anne is still unmarried and considered a spinster at age 28.  A visit to her younger sister Mary puts her in the path of Frederick - now a successful navy captain.  She discovers that she is still in love with him but he appears civil but cold (not having forgiven her for breaking his heart).\nYou'll have to watch the movie to find out how it all turns out but I guarantee that you will find this a thoroughly romantic and enjoyable period piece.  The acting is topnotch and it has the high production values that you would find in an A&E or BBC production. If you've read the book, you will find that this adaptation is very faithful to its source.\nI would also recommend ""Sense & Sensibility"" (Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet), ""Emma"" (Gwyneth Paltrow) and the fantastic ""Pride and Prejudice"" (Jennifer Ehle, Colin Firth) to round out a great selection of Jane Austen films. Be sure to check out ""Wives and Daughters"" (Justine Waddell, Keely Hawes) for another splendid romantic adaptation (this time from Mrs. Gaskell's early Victorian novel).";True to the spirit of Jane Austen. A gem!
126;146.0;5.0;5.0;-16.114545454545436;"""Persuasion"" is fantastic -- you won't find a finer Austen adaptation, or a truer film, or a more romantic love story.  The characterization is uniformly superb -- Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds are absolutely perfect as the leads, and the supporting cast is equally excellent, with Sophie Thompson turning in a great performance as Mary Elliot.  Of especial note, though, is the actress who played her mother-in-law, Mrs. Musgrove -- she was an absolute *delight*, and I wish I knew her name.  She captured the role beautifully.  Wonderful wonderful wonderful.";the BEST austen adaptation i've ever seen
128;147.0;4.0;5.0;-429.19272727272727;First let me state the obvious: I am a fan of Jane Austen, and have been for 30 years.  Secondly, let me state that the first viewing of this adaptation had all the charm of an impacted wisdom tooth.  Unless you are well acquainted with the story, you will be monumentally confused the first time you see it.  This is not a film you can go into blind, because it won't give you any help with what is going on. Oh how the British  love the device of implication and assumed history.  Neither will be much help in understanding this.  The people that I watched this with found it extremely confusing and discordant, and I did too, even though I have read the book many times over the years.  Most of my audience kept complaining that the people looked too British.  If ever there were a cast of singularly unattractive people, this is it.  Anne Elliot looks not so much faded, as enbalmed and brought back from the dead for this performance and I found Frederick Wentworth podgy, buck toothed and very unappealing.  And those were his good points.  This film is chock full of people who seem able to vent with great abandon unless honesty would clear everything up in two seconds flat.  At which times they look tortured and constipated.  The director and writer also saw fit to change things from the book, and none of the adaptations were an improvement.\n  Having slammed their physical appearance, I must say that the people in Hollywood would have cast actors with physical appeal and no substance.  The British cast on the basis of talent, and even if the actors are not particularly handsome, they grow on you.  I can not think of one person who did not do a very good job,  and although I found Anne and Frederick's tortured looks, gaping, gawking, and inability to communicate, extremely irritating, I am inclined to blame the director more than the actors.  Captain Benwick was very good, but he reminded me of the Pillsbury Doughboy playing dress-up.  Anne's eldest sister, Elizabeth, was shrill, annoying and petulantly unattractive.  In short, perfect for the part.  The murkiness and evocative moods, reminded me of Wuthering Heights meets Frederico Fellini.  Brooding and bizarre.\n  If you can over-look dentition, physicality, and mood swings, you will like this movie.  It has a certain  jarring charm, mostly superb acting, interesting wardrobe, and it is unpretentious.  It doesn't care whether you like it or not.  I did, and although my daughter will not watch it with me, my husband very much enjoyed it, and he has watched it with me more than once.  This is the only  Persuasion that I could find, and if you can overlook some things, you will find yourself drawn to it again and again.  The ending is not what I would have done, nor do people in Austen novels kiss on the streets of Bath. In the book, Anne did not seem as wimpy and  irksome as in this.  I frequently wanted to slap her. Hard.;Wuthering Heights and Fellini, meet  the Pillsbury Doughboy
138;148.0;2.0;5.0;18.04470588235297;"This was one of the most boring and tedious videos I have ever seen.  I agree with Leonard Maltin that the film ""demands patience.""  The  two lovers showed very little passion.  Root had almost the same expression  on her face throughout the whole story. The actors spent more time eating  than talking. And there was an overall feeling of heaviness. The book is  far better than the movie. The only good thing about the movie was the  scenery, and so I give it 2 stars.";Sorely disappointed
0;149.0;5.0;5.0;-151.16913793103447;"Apparently the viewer from Baltimore is not the nuanced fan of Jane Austen she (or he) would like to think she is. Perhaps ""fans"" such as this would prefer, say, Leonardo de Caprio and Cameron Diaz in the lead roles. I do not, however, believe this is what Austen would have wanted. ""Persuasion"" was Austen's last novel, and it is her most deeply felt and serious as well. It is often thought to be a reflection of the middle-aged and unmarried Austen's own experience of missed love, but in her case it never had a happy ending. There is a more sombre and bitter-sweet tone to this novel than to her others, and only the coarsest reading of it could miss that atmosphere. The film perfectly captures the feelings of an earnest woman who is beautiful in her own right, and attractive due to her intelligence and gentleness of spirit. She is clearly made of higher stuff than most of those who surround her, yet the brilliant actors and direction never resort to obvious or heavy-handed caracatures of types. Captain Wentworth is not pretty and is, thankfully and quite rightly, not attractive in the glossy, big-toothed Hollywood sort of way. He is, instead, handsome in his dashing and forceful character. Both Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds are perfectly cast in this wonderful and faithful adaptation of Jane Austen's masterpiece.";A film that captures Austen's rich depth of emotion

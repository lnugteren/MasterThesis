5;1.0;4.0;6.0;-167.43455598455597;"The Cobra 18 is a handy little radio.  It sounds good on both ends, has a front firing speaker for installation in cramped conditions, has weather band, channel scan, and dual watch.  It seems to be a quality product that would make a good choice for somebody to put in their off road vehicle.  It has a bright channel display with LED meter lights instead of a needle, which means you can beat it up a little more without worrying about your needle getting stuck after a while.  I only have two real complaints.\n\n1) I would much rather have had an NB/ANL switch than ""SoundTracker"".  ""SoundTracker"" doesn't seem to do a whole lot except maybe sharpen voices a tad, but without an NB/ANL to help even out spikes and fluctuations from mechanical interference, this thing can get pretty annoying.  Driving through a construction area with power lines, construction equipment, fluorescent lights, etc. is down-right painful because even with the squelch cranked to the max I still get occasional spurts of static breaking through.  I can drive through these same areas with my Cobra 148 GTL and get a lot less static and interference, while still being able to communicate effectively.\n\n2) The front-firing speaker is nice for cramped installations, but it isn't much.  In a loud vehicle like a bus with a diesel engine right under my feet and 3 or 4 different heater blowers going, it can get difficult to understand people even with the volume turned all the way up.";Great Radio, Needs ANL/NB Capability
53;2.0;3.0;292.0;-885.8634536082474;"I purchased a Midland 75-822 CB first and then a Cobra 75WST about 5 months later, they are both designed with most, if not all, of the electronics built into the handset type of CBs.  I wanted to use an external speaker with the handheld CB for better sound clarity.  The Cobra's external speaker jack is in a more covenant, out of the way location, with possibly easier to operate with one hand controls than the Midland CB.  On the Cobra the remote speaker plugs into the remote adapter and not directly into the handset as the Midland unit must.  This eliminates that extra (in the way) wire running from the Midland handset to the external speaker and places the extra wire out of the way connecting it directly to the remote adapter of the Cobra, not to the handset.  With an external speaker plugged into the Midland CB its on/off volume and squelch controls are even more difficult to access.  The Cobra handset has a longer coiled cord that's nice but its handset is a little overly large but not unworkable.\n\nThe Cobra volume and squelch controls are more conveniently located but don't have any mid range markings.  This makes it hard to see where your settings are until something comes in too low to hear or screeches out too loud.  They are also a little hard to reach and work with, with your thumb, especially with the on/off volume control which is a little hard and stiff to switch off.  The Midland's controls are on top and kind of a two handed operation, neither manufacture's design is a clear winner while driving a vehicle but maybe the Cobra is a touch ahead here for one handed use.  By the way, when I purchase hand gloves, they are the extra large size.\n\nThe Sound Tracker system appears to work but maybe a bit of a scam from my informal tests.  When you turn the Sound Tracker on, the signal is noticeably quieter but the Midland is always just as quiet in my comparison tests and nothing to switch on.\n\nEach time when you turn your Cobra unit on to listen or talk you have to remember to push a button to activate the Sound Tracker and if you disconnect the 12 volt power all the CB's settings are instantly lost.  The Midland CB retains its settings if it's turned off, and also as long as the 12 V is connected plus even for a period of time even if the 12 V supply is disconnected.\n\nThe Weather Band stations in my area seemed to come in better on the Midland but not much better, I will call this a near tie.\n\nNeither CB radio is a clear winner in my mind.  I think if I were purchasing CBs again it would be the Midland 75-822 because Midland also offers so much more with their CB than the Cobra.  The Midland unit comes with a bonus of two different battery packs, one for regular batteries and a second one for rechargeable batteries plus a rubber ducky CB antenna.  That makes the Midland fully portable allowing you to use it away from your vehicle, not requiring the vehicle's 12 V supply and the vehicle's CB antenna.  Sometimes Midland also offers a power supply brick with their CB to charge the batteries. It's not a very sophisticated charging unit; it does not shut off or tell you when the rechargeable batteries are fully charged.  This leaves you to guess at the time and if they are fully charged.  A fast external charger would probably be a better option.  The Cobra is missing most if not all of these features and from my Internet searches the Cobra cost more.\n\nBoth of my CB radios had electrical problems when first purchased.  The Midland came new from an e-bay purchase and I had to return it directly to Midland for repair/replacement as the display did not work when it got to around 45 degrees in temperature outside.  When the unit warmed up all was OK and in June, July, and August it took a while to notice the problem.  It was cheerfully replaced (not repaired) and they sent me back several more parts than I sent them.  The Cobra unit received signals OK but would not transmit right out of the box.  I did not notice it right away as I assumed since the receiver worked OK and I was reusing an existing antenna all would be OK.  I had the option to return it to the seller or mail it in for, I guess, replacement just as Midland's offered but the Cobra CB came from Amazon.  Returning to Amazon turned out to be a wonderfully simple and fast exchange process.  All my friends have been really impressed when I explained the exchange.  Fortunately I returned the complete Cobra CB, not knowing Amazon would cross ship me a complete and completely new unit, with Amazon paying all the shipping both directions.  As I remember it took just around a week, maybe one or two days longer than the original delivery, I guess they waited just long enough for them to determine my unit was in the mail and on its way back before they sent the replacement.\n\nAgain both CBs are very comparable with no clear winner in my mind but I think maybe Midland has the edge but not enough for me to return my Cobra and order a Midland.  By the way I have no ties to any of the companies in this review.\n\nThis is from my best memory, I hope this helps in your CB radio decision.\n\nDennis";Cobra 75WXST falls a little short
4;3.0;5.0;285.0;-195.34749999999997;The Cobra 75 WX ST Weatherband CB provides an incredible amount of functionality in a very small package.  Installation is fast and easy - with a couple tools, your antenna mounted, and little skill, you can have this radio up and running in an hour or two.\nCB radios are limited to low-power broadcasting at 4 watts or less.  This radio provides maximum power allowed by law and is capable of some pretty incredible range under the right conditions.  With a properly tuned, high-quality antenna, I have had coversations with others using the same radio up to 9 miles away.  Under normal circumstances, 1-2 miles is more realistic.\nAs for features, this one has several:\n- Scan (all 40 channels in sequence)\n- Dual Scan (two channels of your choice)\n- Memory\n- Lock (so the hand controls don't get reset by accident)\n- Weatherband (10 NOAA frequencies)\n- Last 3 channels\n- SoundTracker (like Dolby noise reduction)\nI use mine in a 1999 Jeep Wrangler where there is little extra space for another device.  It fits perfectly on my console with the small box hidden away inside.\nI can listen to truckers while I am on the highway, talk to my friends when we go off-highway, or scan the channels for both when driving to and from the trails.  In the two years I have used mine, it has never given me any problems.  It is very sturdy and should stand up to hard use.\nI purchased the optional external speaker so that it would be easier to hear but many people find the unit works well right out of the box!\nThere might be bigger, badder CB's out there, but this one is a peach!;Quite a Handful
2;4.0;5.0;234.0;-440.6606505576207;This original review was written for the Cobra 75WXST 40-Channel CB Radio.  I don't know what has happened, but the review is now also showing up for the Cobra 18WXSTII Mobile CB Radio with Dual Watch, which is completely different in design, and is a CB I do not own.  If you are reading this review and it's attached to the Cobra 118WXSTII, please disregard it.  On the other hand, I'm still quite happy with my 75WXST.\n\n------------Original review for Cobra 75WXST--------------\n\nAfter looking at multiple CB systems, I finally decided upon this little number for a few reasons.\n\nOriginally, I wanted a CB that would fit in my dash above my radio (I drive a 4Runner) so the CB would look nice and integrated.  I was told by many installers that I didn't have enough depth in my empty slot above the radio.  One installer recommended this CB, but I was skeptical about the small, all-inclusive package.  One thing I did like about this CB right from the start was that it's easy to hide from view, thus reducing any potential break-in for my CB or my Radio.  When I'm not using this CB I slide it under the front seat and it's completely hidden and doesn't bother any passengers.  Another HUGE benefit to this radio that I didn't discover until I used it was that everything is on the handset, which means that everything can be adjusted VERY easily while driving.  In fact, after a few uses, you'll know all the buttons, so you no longer have to take your eyes of the road or bend over to grab the radio or change channels.  I just keep the radio next to my leg and operate it without have to move or look away.\n\nI use a 6ft magnetic mount/unscrewable whip Wilson antenna.  With direct line-of-sight, I can get about 11 miles, significantly farther than I had expected.  In actual use, I get about 4 miles or so.  Also, I typically only use it on the highway.\n\nThe weather band has been especially nice.  I've driven all throughout the south from Arizona to Florida and I've been able to pick up weather stations almost everywhere.\n\nI had my doubts at first with this unit, but after having used it for two years, I've come to really love it.  I would definitely but this CB again.\n\n--------------- 6 years of use update ----------------\nThis CB still works great and I've had absolutely no problems with it.  It's very much a quality product.  Like I said years ago, I keep the CB under the passenger seat when not in use, so it does slide around a bit and gets knocked around from time-to-time.  But still, with 6 years of that kind of abuse, it still works flawlessly.\n\n---------------- 12 year update -------------------\nI live in a hot climate, and the heat has finally taken its toll on the coiled cord.  Although the CB still works fine, the cord is cracking, so I'll probably just buy a new one, or whatever new model has replaced this one.;The Cobra 75WXST is a great little CB!

6;6.0;4.0;11.0;-48.57807692307688;This was my first CB radio. I have several HAM radios but my friends don't have HAM radios in the off road vehicles. They all use CB. So I took the plunge and bought this CB. I bought it because it is so small. And it is the perfect size. It installed very quickly hidden within my dash. All if the controls are in one spot. IT works extremely well. I have to knock it though because the speaker is not great. It becomes very difficult to hear when driving. I recommend looking for an external speaker or buy a CB with a better speaker. Also the controls are very small because they are all on the handset. So short pudgy fingers like mine make it hard to deal with the controls. Otherwise I love it and would buy it again. I do use it allot too. It meets my expectations accept for the speaker.;Great device but speaker lacks
9;7.0;5.0;16.0;-297.1857372654155;"It is virtually impossible to find the Cobra 75WXST in a store or on the sales floor of a truck stop (where CB equipment flourishes).  I would never have know that this particular radio existed except that I owned a similar Cobra handheld product back in the 80s.  This motivated me to check the Cobra website.  The Cobra 75WXST has every necessary feature right in the palm of your hand.  Many vehicles (other than semi's) simply do not have the space to conveniently mount a traditional CB radio chassis under the dashboard.  This unit completely solves this dilemma. The unit is made very robust and every feature that an operator needs to access is right there.  The Cobra 75WXST has a channel scan mode that continually scans all 40 CB channels & stops on each channel that has an active broadcast.  The unit also quickly accesses any 1 of 10 National Weather Stations (I believe there are actually 7 National Weather Stations presently available).  This feature is invaluable for checking regional weather conditions including temperature, precipitation, and wind conditions; particularly if you are pulling a boat, trailer or RV; or driving a motor home.  The install is relatively simple if you have done things like this before.  I have a 1/2 ton Chevy Avalanche and mounted a 4 foot Firestik CB antenna behind the left, rear turn signal using a Firestik SS-204A antenna mount bracket, a Firestik K-1A Push-n-Twist antenna quick disconnect, and an 18' RG-58A/U Coaxial Antenna Cable w/ molded PL-259 connectors (routed from rear bumper location, over the rear axle, along the running board mount brackets, and through the engine compartment firewall).  This amount of cable enabled the Cobra microphone to be in proximity to the driver but I soon added a 5-pin 4' mic cable extension (sold by Cobra as an accessory to this CB model) to provide more convenient access.  The 4' microphone cable also allows the user to easily disconnect the Cobra 75WXST and secure it in a convenient locked compartment in or about the vehicle.  This system architecture also allows the operator to carry the Cobra 75WXST with him from vehicle to vehicle as long as the remaining system components are installed in each vehicle.";Excellent Product
15;8.0;3.0;16.0;-121.94049327354256;I've been using it for a while now and I like it - BUT, the power out is NOT the 4W they advertise. Before anyone jumps the antenna reflected power bandwagon, I'm in electronics and have tested this unit with a spectrum analyzer and dummy load for perfect matches - have yet to see 4W. With absolutely 0 reflected, I peak at 2W. I read some material where it talked about LOW power out, but the display never shows LOW power mode. I will put it back on my lab bench and use bench top DC power supply and provide the highest DC power it's rated for to see if that finally produces full power. If that solves the problem, then I'll look at returning the product. It should be made to handle a normal vehicles alternator output.\n\nAs already mentioned - the speaker leaves A LOT to be desired. They should include an external speaker as part of the CB for the price paid. I'll search for an external, but just because Cobra doesn't already provide one with an expensive CB that they know has speaker issues, it won't be a Cobra speaker.\n\nI do like the small form factor, especially for my JKU. It just needs some improvements to really be an awesome Jeep solution.;Nice, but needs work.
11;9.0;3.0;13.0;1.7450000000000188;ConsumetADVOCATE is a user of cb equipment since the late seventies. This hideaway model is basically a walkietalkie with attached combo power and signal coax. It has a fair noise suppression ANL but the squelch control is touchy. You must watch your matching with your antenna. Use a K40 or Wilson 1000. Install is simple. You can use a cigar or acc port. The display is difficult to read in daylight. It has green backlighting which could be better. I do think this unit is superior to Midland's offering.;Ok buy
7;10.0;5.0;11.0;-210.01747572815532;"Installed this radio on my 2009 Wrangler 2 door and love it so far. I recommend getting Firestik antenna 4' minimum if you are doing a spare tire mount and the 18' Fire-flex Cable Assembly low-profile Fire-ring and Stud.  You can route the cable behind the rear sub and all the way under the carpet/door trim, then mount the box/base unit behind your glove compartment with zip ties. Routing the cable through the rear cargo door is a bit tricky and may be the most time consuming task in the entire project, but be sure to SWR tune your CB BEFORE you zip tie it or you'll be taking it back out again. It's not so easy to access.  Remember- it's the ANTENNA, not the CB that determines your signal range. However- my experience was that the 4' firestik was that it was reasonably close to tuned with about 1"" of antenna extender out (SWR of 1.5 on both channel 4 and 40)- real world highway results of 2.5-3.5Miles of range. You'll need a bigger antenna if you want improved SWR/better range- up to 11miles on a 102"" antenna.\nFor mounting, I can also recommend the RoadPro RP-232 CB Microphone Holder, Black Plastic- at $3 vs the $30+ alternative it works well and if you mount to the passenger side just left of the glove compartment allows the glove compartment to be opened without contacting the CB or cable AND doesn't affect shifting on a manual tranny BUT- you'll need to upgrade to a heavy duty two sided adhesive tape. That's an easy fix.\nI LOVE having everything on the handheld. Key features for me: Compact form factor, Scanning, fingertip access to squelch,  Weather radio, Illuminated display (backlit, which isn't the best but works acceptably).";Great product in tandem with Firestik cable and antenna!
54;11.0;4.0;35.0;-285.36435483870963;"First, a little about my background.  I am an amateur radio operator (ham radio), and an electrical engineer.  So, I know a little about radios.  I got another car, and decided to put a two-meter mobile and a CB in it.  Since the 2M mobile takes up all available space for mounting a radio, I decided to choose this model as my CB.  I have had it going for a few days now and it seems to work just fine.  The advantages of this model, besides the obvious one of being easier to mount, is that it also includes weather reception, a scan mode, and an actual frequency display (a rarity among normal legal CB's).  About the only bad points that I can see is that the unit itself is somewhat large and looks awkward on my dash, the speaker does not sound fantastic (but not too bad considering the size), the knobs are a little difficult to adjust while still attached to the dash, and the cable is coiled and flexible but it is so thick that you have to really tug on it to get it to extend.  The thing that amazes me is the marketing hype.  The ""soundtracker"" technology is close to useless.  If you power on the radio without and antenna, soundtracker sounds great.  However, if you turn it on with an antenna attached while truckers are talking all over the state, soundtracker does nothing for that type of noise.  The problem is that, with CB, you never really get quiet conditions.  If soundtracker is so great, why even include a button to turn it off?  Why not just leave it on all the time?  Soundtracker also claims to increase the transmission strength.  There is really only one way to transmit at full legal power.  If soundtracker does actually improve transmission, that means that they intentionally crippled transmit when soundtracker is turned off.  So, the whole soundtracker thing smells to me like a bunch of marketing hype.  This is still a good choice for a CB, though, if you cannot mount a regular-sized unit in your vehicle.  Just make sure to get a good antenna.  I chose a Larsen designed for 11-meter usage in an NMO mount.";Decent radio, some marketing hype
14;12.0;1.0;13.0;-774.8845075318654;"This radio is only good for the weather radio function and talking to someone within 100 yards if you are tired of yelling back and forth.  This is the third one of these radios I have owned, I bought the first one used and it was a very poor performer.  I would only get about a block away transmission and then it would be very hard to understand, there was basically no modulation, I sold that Jeep and I am sure that poor fella has ripped it out and thrown it off the nearest bridge. The second was in a class A motor home and came installed from the factory, and I always assumed it was a poor performer because I bought this rig used, again this was sold with the vehicle (why would anyone take the effort to take a turd sandwich out?)

10;18.0;4.0;8.0;-267.74680327868845;The CB radio is packed with a lot of great features in a box that doesn't take up space on your dash or elsewhere in your vehicle where it might be in the way.\n\nThe mic is larger, heavier, and unlike a traditional CB mic. This all makes sense since the controls for the entire radio, along with the speaker are all housed in this unit. The buttons on the side for channels and PTT are more like what you find on a handheld CB radio.\n\nThere are some nice features on this radio including the Cobra Soundtracker feature that removes static (works well), and weather bands, channels 1-40 scan, custom 2 channel scan and more. I do wish it had a PA function.\n\nInstallation of this radio itself was as easy as it gets in my 2014 Jeep Wranlger Unlimited Sahara. I've mounted the control box to a bracket behind my glove box. I still haven't decided where to mount the mic but there are many aftermarket options if you don't want to use the little clip that comes with the unit.\n\nSome have complained about volume of the speaker when receiving transmissions. My Jeep is equipped with a soft top. I have not as of yet had the top down since installing and cannot speak to the volume levels while in an open air drive but with the top up, the volume is perfectly loud enough for me to be able to hear the conversation loud and clear. I had purchased an external speaker after reading reviews of low volume but as of yet have not needed to install it. I plan to use it instead while we're sitting around camp and will run the speaker wire out the door to hear transmissions without needing the doors or windows left open.\n\nOverall I am happy with the unit and I think it will serve us well on trips and when traveling off-road. There are cheaper radios out there with the same features so where this unit shines is when you do not have a good mounting place for a standard CB radio control box.;Overall a good radio for compact or tight spaces.

56;20.0;4.0;22.0;-98.33319796954312;"I got this radio as a birthday gift from my wife back in March.  It's been a long time since I've had a CB and I really like this one's features especially the scanning and duel watch features and the ability to easily move it between vehicles.  This week the speaker in the handset died on me also.  However, this unit has a two-year warrantee so I don't understand another commentor's remark that when his unit broke down it would  cost more to have it repaired that the unit originally cost.  As I was driving to the warrantee center, the speaker came back on, but the sound was very scratchy.  It wasn't ""off frequency,"" it's just that the speaker was faulty.  The repair center replaced the speaker in about a half hour and now everything works fine.  You may want to go to the Cobra Electronics web site (Cobra. Com) and see if a warrantee center (not just a dealer) is near you if you have any concerns about this unit's speaker.  I would have given this radio 5 stars if it hadn't been for the speaker problem.";A good Little radio

51;22.0;5.0;19.0;-236.63958456973288;"Being a member of a local Miata club, it is very common for our club runs to use CB's as the form of communication.  Being in a Miata also means there is not a lot of spare room for such things.  After talking to other members and reviews online, I felt this would do everything I needed and then some.  The biggest asset is not having a large ""box"" that would need to be mountet and left in the car.  The second biggest reason I also chose this unit was I needed a CB for our Cherokee 4x4.  By being able to buy a second ""connection"" box for ~$25, I can use the main unit in two vehicles without the full expense of two CB's.\n\nHookup is easy with a power, ground and antanna connections.  The plug for the main unit to the connection box can be run from undernieth the dash or console or mounted in a hole with the supplied mounting plate and grommet.  I used a ""blank out"" panel (unused switch location) in the dash so if I ever remove it, I can just replace this panel with no ill effects.  I drilled a hole in the panel, the same size as the mounting plate and used the supplied grommet in this panel, not using the mounting plate.  It is a very clean installation and when the handheld unit is removed, you never know there was a CB in the vehicle.\n\nThe BIGGEST thing to remember for ANY CB is proper antanna tuning and a quality antanna.  Without this, it doesn't matter how good the CB is.  How important is tuning?  I tuned my antanna for the best SWR readings I could get, which were very good and in our last club run, I was the only person who could talk and receive from everyone in the group.\n\nI am very happy with this product and am looking forward to getting it setup in our Cherokee as well.";Nice and Compact CB That Works Well

I go to remote places and bought this to communicate with others on the trail. I'm no CB expert and this is my first one. I wish more detailed information were included on which antenna to use and what parts were required (mounting options for example). The radio was easy to install and use.\n\nOn my first trip with the radio, the internal speaker stopped working -- less than 20 miles into the trip. I had the top and doors off my Jeep and was on the freeway traveling 70 MPH with the volume turned nearly all the way up. I could hear conversations on the radio for awhile but then silence. When I arrived at the begining of the trail, I looked for what might be wrong. I could see by the signal indicator that the radio was still working but could hear nothing.\n\nI considered calling Cobra to tell them what a disappointment my first experience with them was and to see what options I had. Instead, I bought a plug for the included external speaker jack and wired the radio to my Jeep's speakers.\n\nOverall, I am happy with this radio especially it's size. I also appreciate the all-channel scan and weather channels. I will remember this experience , though, before buying anything else from Cobra.;Internal speaker lasted less than 20 miles

I was pretty apprehensive at first about this CB, as I had used the ""regular"" box-type CBs for 40 years. I bought a Jeep Cherokee Classic that does not have much room to mount a ""regular"" CB, and whats a Jeep without a CB radio?  So I bought this Cobra 75WXST that has all the controls built right into the micophone.  What a great idea and what a pleasant surprise!  This thing works great and is extremely easy to use.  It took me a whole 5 minutes to hook it up (basically plug it in and connect it to an antenna) and it fired right up.  My antenna is a magnetic mount 36"" stainless steel whip Wilson ""Little Wil"". Right away with no antenna tuning I was getting a 5 mile range under hilly, forested terrain.  Out on the open road about 7-8 mile range.  The Cobra is great, has nice sound and easy to read screen.  It scans all channels if you want and has a channel 9 monitor.  The built in NOAA weather radio is a great touch.  This unit has to rank as one of my favorites.  For the money, it cant be beat, especially if you need an unconventional radio due to space limitations.  I would buy another and highly recommend it to everyone.

Bought it because we are leaving tomorrow for 2 months in Alaska towing an RV and I thought this would be good for road info and in case we have a breakdown.  After trying everything to diagnose the problem I sent it back to COBRA for repair.  Turns out it was off frequency.  So they tuned it and returned it.  Upon return, it would not receive as well and I only got acknowledgement of transmission twice out of about 50 attempts.  This was even on major freeway with big rigs going by with the CB antennas on them.  It also would only scan occasionally and would stick on stations where there was no transmission.  Called them and told them I was leaving in a week.  They authorized a return and included a UPS label but for REGULAR GROUND service from Pacific Northwest to Chicago.  I told them at the time I didn't think it could make the round trip in time and he assured me it would.  We were supposed to leave today but delayed a day waiting for this and other items.  A week after shipping there was no phone call,no email and no CB radio.  I strongly urge you to stay away from this unit and COBRA in general.

21;30.0;5.0;8.0;-75.81403614457827;This is an all-in-one unit. There is an advantage and disadvantage to that. Advantage: overall small and no base-unit to mount and find space for. Disadvantage: base units tend to have larger knobs and buttons that are easy to see while driving. The buttons on this are small to keep the overall package small and convenient---this can be like trying to operate a cell phone while driving. Best to set it before you start driving and let it go. Before you buy a CB, however, know that CB's are a dying product. Everyone has cell phones now so there is rarely anyone monitoring the emergency band--not needed. Additionally, there just isn't much traffic to listen to. There are a few people that get on there and use it for their personal rants and not very interesting. I use them for off-roading. Everyone on the trip can tune in to the same station and one-touch comm. Cell phones are not good for instant, mass comm.;Overall pleased

I had a CB radio about 10 years ago with a K40 antenna and remember that the range averaged around 10 miles down here in the SC Lowcountry. I could get 40 - 50 miles if I got down near the water. So I went looking at CB's. After much research and consideration of all the radios available I purchased the 75 WX ST. The main reason is that the mounting options in a Toyota Tacoma is very limited. I received the radio today and was immediately impressed with the solid feel of the unit. I did a quick hook up by plugging it into a battery jump box after attaching a cigarette lighter adapter to the power leads and then plugging in an antenna.\n\nThe sound quality is more that adequate, be sure to take the sticker off the front that covers the speaker holes.\n\nThe controls are nicely laid out and pretty easy to get at. The ""microphone"" is somewhat larger that a standard CB microphone but not too large. The controls can be used either right or left handed.\n\nThe backlight is nice and bright and the display easily viewed from any angle.\n\nThe Sound Tracker function does a good job of pulling the audio out of the background noise.\n\nBecause all CB radios are essentiallty the same with respect to output power I have no doubt that this radio will have transmitting range on par with my previous radio. The quality of any radio transmission is very much dependent on a good antenna/coax with the antenna proprely mounted and tuned. Just connecting a cheap[..]magnetic mount antenna to the radio without adjusting the SWR will make the best radio into a piece of crap.\n\nBuy this radio and hook it up properly and you will be happy.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI've had the radio about 3 weeks now and have had no problems. I would recommend an amplified external speaker though. R/S has them on sale now. Make sure that you get an amplified speaker and not just an extension speaker.";Very nice radio

I often have to have the squelch set so high to block static (from everywhere), that I don't get reception anyway.

40;37.0;4.0;9.0;-73.61251497005986;Great little CB radio. Overall once you get used to what function -is-where, it's easy and comfortable. With these newer compact CB radios SWR tuning is very important. Ive read where many people have difficulty after about one month--the older CB's had larger final transistors which were capable of handling more abuse- these newer ones have smaller, easier to burn out transistors and making sure your Whip and cables are tuned properly is an absolute must(if you want it to live a while). This unit will still talk if not tuned properly, however it won't last very long.

22;38.0;2.0;6.0;-1212.9460973724883;"I ran this CB dash-mounted in my truck for nearly a year.  The following sums up my experience with it.\n\nThe Good:\n\n-The matte finish black radio and mic blends in really well with most dark car interiors.  I liked the way this radio looked installed.\n-The front mounted mic, front-facing speaker, and standard DIN size make it perfect for dash-mount installations.  I installed this radio right beneath my car stereo, in the space where the little ""cubby"" was supposed to be.  It screwed right into the available slots in the radio bracket.\n-The channel display is easy to read, and shows both the weatherband and the cb channels.\n-With the combination of dual watch and the 9/19/Normal button, you have a lot of options for monitoring different channels.  You can run on a certain channel, use the 9/19/Normal button to flip over and check traffic on 19, then flip back without turning the dial.\n-It has battery power input and remembers what the cb and weather channel you were on, so you don't have to flip to it every time you turn on the ignition.  Some of the lower-end radios ""forget"" and reset to channel 1 if they only have one power wire and you want to have the radio come on with the ignition.\n-The scan feature works well if you are in unfamiliar territory or feeling particularly social.\n-The speaker is clear and loud.  I didn't have any problems hearing or understanding people.\n-The stock microphone is pretty decent for a low-end stock mic.  It comes with an adequately sized cable, good connections, and it picks up ample signal.  The transmit is as strong as your average stock radio, and the decent mic signal makes for good modulation.\n-The meter is very bright and easy to read.\n-The radio has a fairly sensitive receive.  It picks up ample signal, basically the equivalent of a stock cobra 29 with the rf gain almost all the way up.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-Soundtracker feature is useless.  From what I understand, it is a compression technology that improves transmission between two radios, but they both have to be running soundtracker for it to work.  Most of the truckers run old cobra 29's, unidens, galaxies, strykers, and so on.... None of which have soundtracker.  The only thing soundtracker does to those signals is compress them.  It makes them seem louder, but it takes out a lot of the highs/lows in the vocal inflection, and actually makes them a little more difficult to understand. I left it turned off, which is just as well, because the radio turns it off every time you turn off the ignition.  Maybe the radio doesn't like ST either :)\n\n-No good place to hang a mic.  Cobra built the radio to be mounted in a dash, but they included a standard mic clip that screws onto the side of the radio.  How are you supposed to clip your mic to the side of the radio when its in your dash?  I would have rather seen them use a spring-loaded lanyard attached to the front, or some other mounting option.  The way it sits, you have to screw your mic clip into something else - and put permanent holes in your vehicle.  Yikes.\n\n-The radio doesn't have a control for RF gain.  As I said, the receive is fairly sensitive, which is typically a good thing, unless you don't have an RF gain, and you drive through noisy environments like cities, highways, or basically anywhere people live and use CB radio.  Having that control over how much signal to pick up is critical in being able to hear the person you intend to hear, especially in radios as sensitive as this one.\n\n-The radio is a hair wider than a standard DIN unit.  I had to shave plastic out of my mounting bracket to get it to fit.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n-After a few months of owning this radio and running it every time I had my truck on, I started to notice a peculiar sound coming from the radio.  It sounded like a tuning fork, and it would gradually get louder and louder until it started to drive me a little batty.  After I turned the radio off for a little while, it would disappear, but only if I let the radio sit.  It seemed to be heat-related.  In colder weather, it wouldn't do it until the truck warmed up, then sure enough, it was at it again.  I turned the radio in for a new one, thinking it was a defective unit.  I was wrong.  The new one did it as well, just like the old one, but only after a few months of use.  I learned after a while not to use the unit full-time on long trips.  I would use it for a while, then give it a break, then turn it on again after some time.  The breaks did the trick, because it wouldn't make the noise as long as I didn't work it too hard.\n\n-The thing that did me in on this radio (and the reason I finally decided to replace it) is the amount of noise it picks up, that I have no control over.  When I first put this radio in my truck, I was using a magnetic antenna, and it was perfect.  Eventually, though, I upgraded to a Firestik and tuned it with an SWR meter, and as I upgraded, it seemed like the radio was no longer a match for my antenna.  Don't get me wrong, it picks up everything now.  That's the problem.  It picks up everything.  Transformer stations, power lines, people with swing kits five states over, my windshield washer motor - everything.  And I have no RF gain to control the noise, and no ANL or Noise Blanker to fight it, either.  With my new antenna, the radio was doing a better job scaring me than helping me talk to people.  So, I had to turn it in for a model with more control.  It got to the point where I had to have the squelch nearly to the stop, just to cut out the noise, and the noise itself was registering at 5-7 db on the meter!  By the time I got all the noise squelched off, I couldn't hear anything else that was going on.\n\nThe Bottom Line:\n\nIf installing a radio in-dash that blends with your car interior is an absolute must for you, this is about as close as it gets, excepting perhaps the one other front-facing speaker unit I've seen by Uniden.  But, be warned - you are going to have to control your signal level with your antenna instead of your radio.  If you only ever plan to run this radio on a run-of-the-mill 3' magnetic antenna, you probably won't have the problems I had.  But if you upgrade to something better down the road, be prepared to hear a lot of noise.  This radio has no defense against it.\n\nAnd last but not least, if you plan to use it daily, choose a different radio.  This would probably  be an ideal radio to throw in an RV or some other vehicle you travel with a few weeks a year, to check the weather and channel 19 once in a while.  In my experience, however, it isn't designed to be a daily beater.\n\nWith the right application and matching antenna, this radio might be a good choice.  If using a CB becomes part of your daily routine, however, you will ultimately outgrow this radio.";Cobra 18WXSTII

The replacement radio was just as bad.  Getting zero help from Cobra, I phoned a wonderful resource, Ken at CB World.  He pointed me to CBTricks.com, where I looked up the radio and found its schematic and factory alignment procedure.  Using a power meter I tuned inductors L17, L19, and L21, to reach a power of 3.5 watts, which I settled on.

If you want a CB for road trips, with weather band you should consider the 75 WX.\nIt has a great scan feature for CB band and 10 weather channels. I have owned the 75 WX for over 10 years now, I have traveled coast to coast with this radio and never had a problem pulling in a weather station anywhere along the trip. This would make a great RV option for a CB or for any vehicle limited on space to mount a conventional CB. Yes, it may not be the best rig for long distance reception or transmission, but so much of that is dependent on the antenna. I use it with a Wilson 1000 magnetic mount antenna with amazing results. The soundtracker feature works great in noisy city areas. If you need a CB for road trips, or where space is at a premium, you will not be disapointed. Surprisingly enough, the built-in speaker works really well, if you need something louder, the radio features a remote speaker jack. I highly recommend this radio for those looking for a good 40 channel CB with weather band.;Great CB for it's intended purpose

You can mount the junction box under the front seat then adjust your channels from the handset.\n3. Has ""scanner"" functionality\n\nCons:\n\n1. Poor signal discrimination. It picks up lots of noise from the environment that comes out as static. You can stop a lot of that with a filter on the incoming power. Which makes you wonder, why didn't they put a filter on the incoming power *inside* the base unit?!\n2. The built-in speaker is useless. You'll need an external speaker.\n3. Even with an external speaker,  it sounds really tinny. I tried both Cobra's own recommended speaker and a random speaker from the Ham Radio Store. Both sounded like the radio was attached via string and tin can (but either speaker sounds fine attached to the ham radio).\n4. Bumping the channel selector is easy to do while reaching for the microphone where it's hung probably near your knee (depending on how cramped your dash is). Then you wonder why the channel has gone so quiet and why nobody responds to your calls. Erk!\n\nAll in all, it's a mediocre radio, which makes it fairly typical for CB radios, which are built to a price point rather than to a quality point. (Sorry, I use $500+ ham radios regularly, compared to that quality of gear any CB radio I've used has had all the quality of a children's toy guitar compared to a Strat or Les Paul). So that's a 3 star review EXCEPT: It's pretty much the only CB radio that'll fit in many modern cars, which have dashboards so crowded that you can't even mount a CB on the kickpanel anymore because of all the wires and such blocking your way. If CB radios came with detachable face plates like ham radios that wouldn't be a problem, but they don't. So for a significant number of people, this is the most useful CB radio in the world -- because it fits, whereas no other CB will.";The One for cramped cockpits

36;43.0;1.0;7.0;-220.60328075709776;I received this item in November and used it maybe two or three times. It should be noted that the scanner functionality never worked, after repeating the instructions multiple times. I confirmed it was the fault of my individual unit by comparing it to a model purchased the same week by a friend.  I went to turn on the unit a few weeks later (sat idle most of the time, power off) and there was simply no sound output. Lights and display worked fine, but no sound of any kind. I removed it from my car for a few months, and finally contacted Cobra. They instructed me to ship it to them (at my cost) and they would repair or replace at their discretion.\n\nI received this item last week (2/17/11), reinstalled it that same Friday (2/18/11) at which time I tested it. Both the scanner and the audio worked! I turned the unit off, and drove my vehicle normally over the weekend. This morning (2/21/11) on my morning commute, I smelled a plasticky sort of melting smell, one that turns the hair of anyone with any tech background. I was afraid it was from my car and did not make the connection. This evening I turned on the radio.....and no sound. Just for kicks (as I was already pretty furious) I tried the scanner. No scanning functionality. The unit up-close smells of burned electronics, the same as it did the first time.\n\nI would rather not have to send this in again, as I have absolutely no confidence left in Cobra. The return period has long since past, and it costs me about $9 to ship this back. The features of this radio are great on paper, but the quality is not there. I will likely go to Midland for my next CB.\n\nRemember, caveat emptor.;Good idea, very poor quality

I really wanted to have a CB because of the nature of my work but felt limited due to space.  I didn't want to stick a radio on the passenger side like everyone suggests because I knew it would be in my wife's way when she rides with me.  I got the 75 and it has been great. I mounted the connection box between the passenger seat and the center console. From there i have plenty of cable with the radio to hang it just under the passenger side air vent.  I got an external speaker but really don't need it.  The Jeep is a little noisy but I can hear the radio just fine, even better than the external speaker.  I have a cheap mag mount antenna on the roof and I'm pulling in conversations around ten miles away.\nGreat, great, great purchase.\nThe weather channel is handy too.\nI really like the ""dual watch"" capability which allows me to monitor two channels or I can scann through all 40.\nBuy this one.

28;46.0;5.0;6.0;-43.928760330578484;Jeep Wranglers have limited space so this CB was an easy choice. I've owned full sized Cobra CB's installed in full sized pick-ups and they never let me down & always performed better than I expected. This little Cobra 75WXST compact model also performs exactly as advertised. It scans, receives weather broadcasts & installation was easy. The tiny speaker is functional but with windows open on a noisy highway, hearing can be difficult ... but it has an audio out mini-jack so it can easily be connected to a radio that has an audio input mini-jack. This is a great accessory for emergency, off-road or just listening to & chatting with other drivers on the road.  It's also much safer than texting :);Quality Compact CB For A Small Vehicle
24;47.0;1.0;5.0;-11.873983050847428;Save your money do not buy this POS!!!!!!!!!!!\nFirst trip out with my four wheel club where a CB radio is mandatory the POS worked for the first hour. The mic for some reason will automatically key its self, So if you weren't paying attention nobody would be able to talk and it pissed everyone off. Sure if you reset the damn unit it would work for about a hour at a time, then same old s*** would happen.\nI wish i would have read some of the reviews before i had purchased it.\nI bought this unit because a friend of mine had one. He said he loved it. Guess mine was made on a monday.;POS
25;48.0;5.0;5.0;-494.5839795918366;"Works great as a CB radio and NOAA Weather radio in the car.  Mine's squeezed into the double DIN stereo slot in the dash of an Accord along with an aftermarket head unit (stereo).  I was able to screw the factory side mounting brackets into both the head unit and the CB radio to hold them together and then I just slid the whole thing back into the slot.  There is an almost unnoticeable gap on either side of the CB radio that doesn't concern me in the slightest.\n\nI connected the power wires (constant power and ignition) into the harness for the head unit and grounded the CB radio to the head unit.\n\nI'm using it in conjunction with a Little Wil 36"" magnetic mount antenna (very well reviewed smaller antenna) and it performs wonderfully.  A good antenna will make or break this and any other CB radio - I had it hooked up to an old un-tuned 12"" Radio Shack job and switching to a longer, tuned antenna made all the difference.  I ran the antenna coaxial cable under some trim panels and then behind the stereo console to plug it into the CB radio.  If mounted in a stereo slot, the antenna cable might just have enough room on one side or the other to squeeze out the front, but running it from the back is probably the best idea not only for looks but so the antenna cable doesn't get crushed or stripped/cut on sharp metal dash parts.\n\nDual Watch and Scan are nice features and Sound Tracker definitely seems to boost transmission as well as receiving, though I don't have a SWR Meter to test for sure.\n\nThe Mic seems a little plasticky-cheap and bulky, but works just fine.\n\nNo function for Public Address despite amazon's Product Description last line: ""...CB/PA Switch..."".  Unless I'm reading that wrong.  At any rate, there's no output for a PA speaker, and no switches/indicators on the face of the CB radio for PA.\n\nWhat I'd change if I could:\n-The LED indicators for Dual Watch, Sound Tracker, and Scan are directly underneath each corresponding button and installed in my Honda Accord underneath the already low positioned stereo head unit this causes the LED indicators to be hidden by the buttons.  I can't see them without ducking my head.\n-It's a little pricey for a CB with Weather, I guess you pay for the novelty of mounting it in a single DIN stereo slot.  I decided it was worth it when I bought it, and I think I'm sticking to that decision.\n-It'd be nice to have different color options, especially since this unit is intended to be installed directly above or under a head unit which all seem to have different color options now.  LED technology has come so far, but it could just add price to an already fairly expensive radio.\n-No dimmer.  It's a bit hard to read what channel you're on when in direct sunlight, but fortunately it's not too bright at night to cause glare.\n\nNone of these small inconveniences cause me to knock off any points from 5 stars - it does what it's supposed to do very well, and the convenient option of single DIN mounting to add function to a clean look is worth it to me.\n\nI'll update this review if needed.";A little pricey, short on options, but good tool and great convenience
33;49.0;5.0;6.0;-67.43841463414631;I have had these installed in every vehicle owned for several years now. They hold up over time and have not failed me yet. The CB handset has all features included, the power and antenna connector boxes can be bought separately, and are easy to install. Just be sure to use a good antenna. Weather feature and noise canceling work as advertised. The black plastic of the handset, while looking somewhat cheap has held up well. The yellow back light could use a brightness setting though. Very nice radio. I have replaced all others with these.\n\n4 watts output, loud audio, easy to use and install. Will last for years of use. You need these in all vehicles!\n\nWorks well for logging roads and back roads.

Reception and transmission is excellent. I have a Wilson ""Little Will"" magnetic mount antenna fixed to the top of the tool box in the bed of my truck.  The SWR's were very easy to set and almost perfect as was out of the box. A slight adjustment to the height of the antenna and I am at 1.1 to 1 at channel 19.  I am receiving transmissions up to twelve miles away and I am transmitting up to eight miles regularly. I added a external speaker which greatly improved my ability to understand transmissions.

Unfortunately I was also unable to contact Amazon in time to have it replaced and am now stuck with a very expensive paperweight.

38;53.0;2.0;6.0;-181.95779720279717;Ok, So I setup this radio in my 09 toyota tacoma. I set it up with a 5 foot firestick antenna, and firestick cable. I had to ground the sheet metal on the toyota and the mount to bring my swr down. I got it to 1.1 to 1. I only used it for testing the SWR and receiving until it was kosher. I didn't want to burn it out. So after 2 weeks of use once the Antenna system was all setup it burns out. It was a slow steady burnout. Over the course of an hour. I started hearing a LOT of static that progressed into a hiss and when I keyed up it flickered and was done. I checked the fuses and no such luck... Its done. So should I bother taking it to a cb shop and getting it repaired? Well over the last 2 weeks I learned something. First off a gain adjustment would have been wonderful, It would allow me to fine tune reception to eliminate the Electro Magnetic Interference that I hear when driving by the malls or under power lines. Second I had been eyeing the cobra 29 wx as it will interrupt and bring through weather warnings. I commute 140 miles a day and go through some canyons that reach 4500 feet, they are prone to snow in the winter.. So should I spend money to get it repaired or buy something better? Buy something better. Kick down the extra few bucks and get a more durable radio with a few extra features. Buy quality the first time and it lasts a long time. Buy cheap and you replace it many times. My 2 cents...;Sad
27;54.0;4.0;5.0;-146.9735714285714;"Works fine, I like all of the features that I've tried. I don't need to monitor 2 frequencies at once so I don't use the ""dual watch"" feature, nor have I used the scan feature. I love the ""SoundTracker Noise Reduction System"", it has the ability to simultaneously reduce some background noises, while amplifying the incoming signal. The main reason I selected this radio was the immediate access to NOAA. I commute about 45 minutes one way in mostly rural areas, and bad weather can come up quickly. At the push of a button I can be informed of dangerous weather. I like the channel 9-19 quick option, but I doubt if anyone is Monitoring 9 in my area; but I wish that every  time I turned the unit on, it wouldn't be on 9. I have not used the External Speaker, but I can't figure out why Cobra didn't add a P A output too. A few more things, this unit has 3 wires on it and they recommend wiring one to a fuse block, my fuse block is under the hood. I tied the Red and Orange wires together, and ran them to a Cigarette lighter plug. The second thing is my Cigarette plug has an LED indicator light on it, and when I leave the unit plugged in and OFF, it runs my Battery down. I don't believe it's the LED doing it.

39;55.0;4.0;6.0;-51.98999999999998;I BOUGHT THE COBRA 75WXST PRETTY MUCH KNOWING THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME COMPRMISE COMPARED TO A 'REGULAR BOX TYPE ' CB. DUE TO SPACE RESTRICTIONS THIS WAS THE BEST WAY FOR ME TO HAVE A CB IN MY TRUCK. I OWN A FORD F-150 2004. THE ONLY PLACE I COULD POSSIBLY MOUNT A BOX TYPE CB, WAS AT THE FEET OF THE PASSANGER SIDE OF THE TRUCK. THIS OF COURSE PUT IT OUT OF SAFE REACH WHILE DRIVING. I WENT WITH THE COBRA DUE TO THE FACT, ALL CONTROLS WERE IN THE MIC AND I WAS ABLE TO LOCATE IT CLOSE TO MYSELF. THE UNIT ITSELF WAS ALOT SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. I GUESS THIS IS DUE TO IMPROVED ELECTRONINCS AND THE ABILITY TO PUT ALOT INTO SMALL PACKAGES. THE CB DOES WHAT I NEED IT TO DO. I MAINLY USE IT ON LONG TRIPS FOR MONITORING ROAD AND TRAFFIC CONDITIONS. I FIND THE MIKE A LITTLE BIG AND THE VOLUME/ON/OFF AS WELL AS THE SQUELCH CONTROLS SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT, BUT MANAGEABLE. THERE IS A BUTTON THAT IS SUPPOSED TO 'QUITE DOWN' BACKGROUND NOICE WHEN THE SQUELCH IS MINIMIZED, BUT I FIND THIS DOES'NT SEEM TO WORK ALL THAT GREAT [ MY OPINION ] THAT SAID THE UNIT DOES WHAT I NEED IT TO DO WITH THE ANTENNA CONFIQUERATION I USE.

I liked being able to monitor 2 channels at the same time.  I also liked the NOAA weather radio.\n\n This radio had great reception, until... it just pooped out.  I contacted Cobra, they said, just send it back, we'll fix or replace it.  I sent it and got it back in less than 2 weeks, with a note saying that it had a broken wire.  I took it out of the box and tested it.  I had the same basic problem.  The weather channels were not clear, didn't match the channels that are operating in my area, and I had to turn the volume all the way up to hear it.  It didn't work this poorly when I first got it.\n\n  Also just to make sure it wasn't me, I checked this against another Cobra CB that I installed since this radio broke.  I simply unplugged the antenna and swapped it over.  The tune was the same, the environment was the same, but the Cobra 75 WX ST didn't perform as it did when I first bought it, or even as well as my other Cobra 29 WX ST NT.\n\nI'm still working to resolve my issue.

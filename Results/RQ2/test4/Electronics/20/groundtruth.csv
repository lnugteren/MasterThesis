2;1.0;5.0;6.0;-278.1337265415549;"I'm using the RC930 base unit with two RC930 extensions connected to two ViP622 HD DVRs.\n\nAlthough Amazon recommends the RC920 extension, DO NOT buy the RC920 extension if you want Caller-ID functionality.  Since I couldn't find just an RC930 extension for sale anywhere (even eBay), I bought 2 of these ""base unit with extension"" packs.\n\nThey work as advertised, passing Caller-ID as long as you enable the Caller-ID feature on the satellite receiver.\n\nInstallation took less than five minutes in three distinct steps:\n\n1. I plugged in all three devices and connected the phone cords.\n\n2. I pushed the button on the side of the base unit which caused it's green light to power on solid, indicating it was ready to communicate with the extension devices.\n\nNotes: You may have to push that button a couple of times for it to stay on solid, vice blinking.  That puts the base unit into a ""security programming mode"".  It will stay in that mode for 5 minutes while you push the button on the side of the extension device(s).  After 5 minutes the light goes out, indicating it's no longer in the programming mode.  All extensions will have to be programmed during this 5 minutes, or you'll have to start again.\n\n3. I pushed the button once on the side of the each extension device.\n\nNotes: The light should blink once while it synchronizes with the base unit, and then stay on solid for a couple of minutes to let you know the security programming is complete.  If the light on the extension is continually blinking after you press the button, it means for whatever reason, the extension can't communicate with the base unit.  That's usually caused by old/bad house wiring or interference caused by other electrical devices.  I don't know if that happens very often, but I have a lot of electrical devices plugged in and have no problems what so ever.\n\nTo recap, plug devices in and connect cables, push the base unit button, and then push the button on the extension.  That's all there is to it and you're finished.";Dish Network and Caller-ID compatible phone extensions
11;2.0;5.0;56.0;24.481363636363668;I needed a quick solution for my TiVo and Directv video setup.  Both require a phone jack for downloading program data.  This was the solution I was looking for.  It worked right out of the box with about 5 minutes setup time to find the best connection.  There is even some thinking on a major TiVo forum that this product will protect your modem from surges.;A must for TiVo, Directv
1;3.0;3.0;44.0;43.61739130434785;"This is a good product, if you have a modem that's 33.6K and below!  The product description is inaccurate.  When I received the product, the package says, ""Works up to 33.6K.""  It is Caller ID compatible  and you can send and receive data and faxes, but only up to 33.6K.  Well, I  was going to return it, but I could use it for my phone.";Does not connect at 56K, only works up to 33.6K
7;4.0;5.0;21.0;-266.4157142857142;"I've used the RCA RC930 Wireless Modem Jacks to create a poor man's wireless network in my home.  It works!  And I love it!  I can now sit in any chair of my house, surf the web, and print (across the room) to my wireless HP 995 Bluetooth printer.\nMy system consists of two sets of RCA Wireless Modem Jacks (a sender and receiver unit in each set) -- one set for the upstairs and one set for the downstairs (which appear to be on separate circuits and are not connected); a 3Com Bluetooth PC card for my laptop; and a HP 995 Bluetooth printer.\nI now use my laptop in the following manner: first, I plug the RCA receiving unit into the wall outlet nearest where I want to sit; then I turn on the printer; and finally, I extend the little blue tooth-shaped antenna (how cute!) on the laptop's PC card -- and I'm all set to go!\nThe RCA Modem Jack is good up to 56k, which is ok since I don't have internet cable or DSL service in my area.  But I'll gladly trade-off mobility for speed any day.  Here's why.\nMy desktop computers (old and new) are in my upstairs bedrooms -- where I can't use them when my family is sleeping.  They are also far away from where my family spends most of its time -- and that's downstairs by the TV's.\nWith the RCA wireless modem jacks, I can now access the internet --- while watching TV with my family; and I can surf the net long after everyone has gone to sleep -- when internet speeds are fastest.  The connection is fairly clean (free of static); and the transfer speed is nearly as fast as if I had accessed the phone jack directly.\nI've gotten very used to sitting in my favorite chair and surfing the net. When cable or DSL eventually come to my neighborhood, I guess I'll have to set up a wireless network in my home (for a lot more money) -- in order to maintain my mobility.\nUntil then, I'll use the next best thing -- RCA's Wireless Modem Jacks.  They're great!";A Poor Man's Wireless Network -- That Works!
13;5.0;4.0;22.0;22.875000000000014;If you don't want to run a new phone jack to accomodate a PTV recorder such as Tivo or ReplayTV, this jack works just fine.  While it may only be connecting at 33.6 or so, it has been rock solid reliable since I've gotten  it, and saved the expense of installing a new jack.  I wouldn't use this  instead of a real jack for a 56K modem, but for applications where speed  isn't critical (like Tivo), this works great.;Works great for Tivo/ReplayTV
6;6.0;4.0;17.0;-2.0582178217821507;I was having all the same frustrations as the other reviewers.  I had horrible humming and buzzing - it was quite frustrating.  I thought it had something to do with the range, but after playing with it for an hour or so, I discovered that this device *needs* to be plugged directly into your wall jacks to work as intended.  If you plug it into a surge protector or UPS (like I had done), you get a bunch of noise and really [bad] connections.\nNow that I've plugged both units directly into wall jacks, my FAX machine is now happily working.;Had the same problems, but figured it out...
3;7.0;4.0;12.0;-20.99816513761465;I have used this wireless phone jack system to connect a DirecTV receiver for over 18 months (and for three months, a Tivo) without a problem.  The stations are about 20 feet apart with a wall and furniture in between, but I have not had connectivity issues.  I have two wireless networks (b and g)in the same area and have not had the interference problems others have mentioned.  That said, my parents tried using the same system in their home and got lots of static and dropped modem connections over a 15 ft. line-of-sight installation with no other wireless networks, so the system seems to be somewhat picky.;Good for DirecTV
5;8.0;5.0;14.0;-2.3849484536082173;I was quite concerned with buying this based off of the mixed review it has received. However, having used it now for several months, I am totally satisfied with this product. Nightly since I installed it, it has not missed downloading the programming from Panasonic for my Replay TV DVR.\n\nI have it set up all the way on the far end of my kitchen going to the far end of my living room (about 35 feet). I have it plugged in in my kitchen pretty much underneath a flourescent lamp, still with no issues. Recommended.;Used with DVR
4;9.0;3.0;10.0;-49.82246987951805;"I have a limited number of phone jacks in my home, and the RC930 helps out alot.  Without it, I would have phone line strung everywhere.  I use the RC930 for internet access for my computer upstairs.  I usually connect between 33.2 and 34.6 Kbps with the units about 15 feet apart.  I have had fluctuations in the speed from 19.2-37.4 Kbps depending on what I have operating at the time.  It's a little slow, but not bad for surfing the web or playing some online games.  I wouldn't recommend it if you download large files, and I keep a long phone cord for those purposes.  If you don't mind phone cord all over the place, then I'd recommend just purchasing the extra phone cord; however, if you'd like an alternative, then the RC930 works fine.  The price is way too high for what it's worth, though.  This is why I only give it 3 stars.";Not bad for browsing the web
10;10.0;5.0;12.0;33.84646341463417;I frankly didn't think that this product would work in my house, in that the wiring is very old as is the phone line.  But it was easy to setup and worked right away.  Even though I have a 56k modem I was never able to connect faster than 36 bps.  With the wireless I'm getting connected between 26.4 bps and 33 bps.  I'm happy with it.  Still waiting for the day broadband comes to my neighborhood, though.;Easy to setup and does what it says
8;11.0;2.0;10.0;-50.018235294117616;"This product will reduce the connection/sound quality in any and all circumstances, but may also be a useful compromise. If you have decided not to add a new telephone jack, even though you could probably use one; you may want to get this.  The ""wireless modem jacks"" are superior to the less expensive ""wireless phone jacks,"" they provide better sound quality and faster data rates.  I know this from experience(the modulation of the telephone signal into a radio signal is the source of the quality loss). I have also read that nearby ham radios may experience some interference.\nAll in all, I'm glad that I have one but the outrageous prices that are charged for this very simple device prevent me from giving it more than two stars...This price is bad enough.";This product can be a useful compromise
9;12.0;4.0;8.0;23.140348837209316;I thought this product was not going to work well in my house, however it turned out to work better than I expected. I have it hooked up to my modem on my laptop. I download web pages at about the same rate as before (long cord to the phone jack) at times even faster. It does disconnect once in a while but this is a small price to pay when it saves me from dealing with long phone cords. Was worth the gamble for me.;Works better than I thought
12;13.0;4.0;8.0;-37.3813636363636;"Had a small setup problem (I needed to do the security setup before it would let me hear a dialtone), otherwise I use it on my tivo and it works just fine (so far).\nUpdate (several years later). This unit is really lousy. I called tivo for an unrelated issue one day, and the guy on the phone said ""you're using one of those wireless modem things aren't you"" - he could tell because my dialup pattern was an abbatoir. I didn't know because the tivo managed to mask the failures, but after trying several online tivo updates, I got to finding out how much this really doesn't work. I have a series 2 tivo now and am using an 802.11 network which is infinitely better and faster.";It kind-of sucks really
0;14.0;1.0;8.0;39.69591836734697;I can't assess the quality of this product because it didn't work at all. I followed the instructions to the letter and heard absolutely nothing (not even a dial tone) on the remote phone. Obviously, something is sorely  lacking in quality control. I am returning the device.;A Piece of Junk

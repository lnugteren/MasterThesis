97;1.0;1.0;6.0;-24.779067796610136;No doubt Tivo is the invention of the millenium, if you love TV (especially sports) like I do. But Phillips Tivo units are the worst electronic product I think I have ever purchased. There is a reason their warranty is 'limited' and after 90 days you will pay something to get it fixed. Every Phillips Tivo unit I've had, including the new 7000 unit, has broken in under a year, but over the 90 day full guarantee. And don't think you are actually going to talk to someone at Phillips, not without giving them your credit card # you aren't. Unfortunately, it appears the new Directv Tivo units are made by Phillips. Ugh. Bad choice, Directv.;Tivo great, Phillips stinks.
92;2.0;5.0;188.0;-209.60108910891086;TiVo's claim that they'll change the way you watch TV is completely true.  Being able to pause or replay whatever you're currently watching to grab a snack, answer a call, etc. is great.  You can't imagine how helpful it is  to have almost two weeks of programming information available to pick and  chose what to record for the next few days.\nI'd recommend the 30hr unit  over the 14hr if you can afford it.  After you start searching the two week  guide by program name, channel name, favorite channels, or by time of day  you'll quickly find plenty of things you want to record.\nDirecTV viewers  will especially find this useful...it makes all those channels much more  manageable, and I prefer the TiVo on-screen guide to the one my DSS box  provided.\nAll of the TiVo menus are well thought out, attractive, and  *very* easy to use.  They include lots of cables - including S-Video, a  phone jack splitter (nice touch), and other goodies so almost anyone will  find everything they need to hook TiVo up right out of the box.  The User's  Guide is helpful too, for people who are a little less sure of themselves  around stuff like this.\nI picked TiVo over ReplayTV because of their  close alliance with DirecTV (DirecTV has invested in them), and from  reading other people's comments in newsgroups and other forums.  After I  spent about half an hour going through the program guide and giving various  programs 'thumbs up' or 'thumbs down' ratings (one of the cooler features  of TiVo), it came up with a whole bunch of other programs it suggested I  might like.\nI'm probably sounding like a company spokesperson, but I'm  not, I'm just a *very* happy new user of TiVo!;For once, a product that lives up to its ad slogans
94;3.0;2.0;102.0;-205.81377551020404;"I bought it.  I sent it back. The equipment is not completely reliable yet.  I had the system freeze up twice.  I became slow and unresponsive to commands on other occasions.  (Consumer Reports said they had problems with  system crashes on two units.)  Despite the potential unreliability of hard  disks and the cost of the system, no extended warranty protection is  available if you buy online (some brick and mortar retailers do offer them  indepdently of Philips). You have two people to deal with if there is a  problem: Philips and Tivo and they both kept pointing fingers at each other  and claiming it's they other guy's problem.  Hold times were tolerable when  I first got the unit but had become excessive by the time I sent it back.  The TV listings are not up to date -- despite the fact that new program  data are downloaded daily.  I also encounter occasional errors in their  listings. The software still needs work.  The system got better at picking  programs for me at first but as I entered still more thumbs up/thumbs down  data I got more garbage.  The program is artificial stupidity - not  artificial intelligence.  I gave thumbs up to ""Singing in the  Rain"" and started getting everything Debbie Reynolds was ever in. The  Season Pass also needs work.  It's OK for broadcast networks.  But if I  want a season pass for Homicide: Life on the Streets on Court TV, it  records the same episode four times each day (same thing on any cable  channel that repeats broadcasts of particular programs). Even if you're not  waiting for the price to come down, my advice is wait for them to get it  right.  The current version should be labelled a ""Beta"" version.";I like the concept but the technology isn't there yet.
31;4.0;3.0;82.0;-870.5297717842323;"First off, I want to say that I am completely satisfied with my Philips 30 hour recorder, ONLY because of the 100 dollar rebate along with a 100 dollar gift certificate that I had.  So I paid only 200 dollars for a product that I knew I was simply going to use to record just a FEW television shows.  I was not getting tivo because I wanted to pause or rewind live tv or record 30 hours worth of shows.  For 200 dollars and not expecting much from this product, tivo was completely worth it.  I can record up to 9 hours at best quality, which is equal to live tv quality.  I don't like watching recordings at less than tv quality and besides 9 hours is plenty for me; I'm not trying to record every single show being broadcasted!  I hardly ever pause live tv, but occassionally I will rewind a few minutes to catch something I missed or want to watch more carefully (i.e. basketball play).  Right after, I usually fast forward back to live tv (you can skip straight to live tv, but by fast forwarding it's like skimming the show, so that you don't really miss anything).  Another cool thing with tivo is that you get displays like direct tv, whereas you can see the title of the show and read a short summary.  Set up was very easy and straightforward.\nAnd now for the drawbacks of tivo (which far surpasses the good things).\n1. Unless you have a newer tv with 2 video inputs, you can't record one show, while viewing another.\n2. You can only rewind live tv back to the point where you changed the channel.  This means that if you change the channel to Leno and just barely miss the punchline... too bad, you can't rewind.\n3. You can only pause for a max of 30 mins.\n4. You can only rewind to a max of 30 mins, UNLESS the show is being recorded, in which case you can rewind all the way to the beginning of the recording.\n5. If you are watching tv behind real time and want to change the channel for a few minutes, when you come back to the show you were watching, it'll resume at real time and you can't rewind, so you'll have missed however much time you were behind.\n6. The ""Season Pass"" function is supposed to record the selected show no matter what time it plays and no matter what channel.  I got a season pass for Spin City, but I had to set 2 Season Passes... one for channel 13 and the other for channel 7 in order for it to work correctly.\n7.  The Thumbs up/down system doesn't work very well.  For some reason I end up with more Fresh Prince of Bel Air (3 thumbs up) than Spin City (which I have a season pass for).  Also, my tivo likes to record practically every movie on Sundance even though I give every single one of those movies 3 thumbs down.\n8. Since the tivo box is ALWAYS on, there's no way for it to tell if you're actually there watching tv.  So in the middle of a show a message will pop up asking to change the channel so that it can record a ""tivo suggestion.""  Sometimes this is a hassle to find the remote and select ""cancel recording and stay on this channel.""  Also, if you're listening to the tv, but not actually watching it, you may miss the pop up message, in which case it will automatically change the channel and start recording.  This means, that you have to cancel the recording, and then switch back to the channel you were on, therefore missing part of the show you were listening to.\n9. Sometimes you'll be watching a show (which is not being  recorded) and something really spectacular or funny will happen.  You would think that you could rewind and then hit record, so that you could show it to somebody later.  But when you hit record, it'll start recording from live tv to the end of the show.  This is also the same problem if you have live tv paused.  Let's say the phone rings, so you pause the show you're watching.  You realize that you're going to be on the phone for longer than 30 mins, so you hit record.  When you go back to watch the show, you'll find that it didn't record from the point it was paused at, but rather the point of live tv when you hit record.\n10. Shows are recorded based on the tivo programming guide which is downloaded over your phone line.  This means that many times you will miss the intro or last joke of a recorded show.  Or if a game goes into overtime, yep, that's right you miss the whole overtime.  Of course you can always record manually by setting a time period, but that's kind of a hassle.\nTo sum it up, imagine this: You invite a friend over and you begin demonstrating your tivo system.  Your friend says ""do this... do that.""  Well, you can be sure that with the majority of those things, you'll have to reply, ""it can't do that.""\nIf you want something that records shows easily and at good quality and you don't mind blowing 400 dollars plus the cost of tivo service (10 bucks a month), then tivo is for you.  If you're looking for a really cool gadget that has complete control over tv, save your money because you're going to be disappointed.";Good for recording, not worth the money
54;5.0;5.0;77.0;-701.135313700384;"Both are light years ahead of VCRs, both have ups and downs, either will change your idea of how television is watched.  They both pause live TV, find and record your favorite shows without the hassles that tapes create.  They both allow you to pay service costs up front (actually Replay  _requires_ it), and if you do they both cost the same.\nTivo advantages:  Suggestions.  You give shows you like or don't like up to three thumbs up  or thumbs down, and Tivo will look for things that match those preferences.  Note that your preference information is never shared with Tivo Inc.  It  never leaves your house, the box makes the suggestions itself.\nRecording  by date, time, and channel.  Useful for lengthy shows you only want a part  of, events that may run past the scheduled end time.\nReplay advantage:  Theme areas which will record things based on keywords or actors.  Tivo  doesn't yet have this, but will by at least Halloween, probably sooner.  As  with Replay, software upgrades for Tivo are done automatically during the  nightly call so existing Tivo owners will get it free.\nWhere Replay  scared me off was it's labyrinth of complex scheduling and show retention  rules and it's disk management, which essentially chops up the disk into  separate areas for each show.  If you make the shows ""guaranteed""  (which does not actually guarantee the show will record), those areas won't  share space with each other, even if they aren't using it.  For  ""non-guaranteed"" shows space is shared, but no warning about  schedule conflicts is given so you never really know what's going to be  recorded.  Even Replay doesn't know if a show will pass all the tests until  moments before it's on, so it can't tell you in advance.  Think that  Frasier ""show"" area will catch double episodes?  Nope, show areas  only catch one showing per day.  NBC shows Frasier at 8:00 one night  instead of 9, but you're covered, right?  Nope, show areas won't find a  show if it moves more than one slot away from it's normal time.  So you use  a ""Theme"" area for Frasier instead of a ""Show"" area,  another way to do automatic recordings.  Set it for an hours worth of  programming and you're set!  Double episodes, hour long episodes, no  problem, right?  Except that theme areas grab shows from every channel on  the dial, and your UPN affiliate shows two syndicated episodes of Frasier  every night (this isn't hypothetical, mine does), so your Frasier theme  area gets those too.  So what, you say, they'll just get overwritten when  the prime-time episodes run?  Nope.  Replay theme areas won't throw away a  show until it's a day old, so when Frasier comes on NBC at 9:00, Replay  finds the hour-long Frasier area already full of shows it can't delete yet  so it doesn't record _any_ prime time episodes, even if there is space  somewhere on the disk.  The solution is to up the Frasier area to two hours  so it can hold both the syndicated episodes you don't want and any hour  long or double episodes you do.  You actually have to manage and allocate  space yourself, and to do it effectively you have to be aware of when  channels you don't care about show episodes you don't want since they can  prevent Replay from recording or keeping what you _do_ want.  Even VCRs  don't demand that much care and feeding.\nA Tivo ""season pass""  handles this neatly and simply.  It only records from the specific channel  you set it to, but it doesn't restrict the times or number of episodes that  will be recorded and it doesn't restrict shows to sharing a tiny portion  the disk, so you'll get long, double, or moved episodes (unless a moved or  extra episode conflicts with something else - neither Tivo or Replay can  record two things at once, so something won't get recorded if that  happens).  Tivos to-do list shows you everything it will record through  it's 10 days of programming data, and because Tivo projects it's space  requirements throughout those 10 days, it knows it advance when a new  recording would exceed it's capacity, and offers to delete some shows  earlier than planned or cancel the recording.\nWith Tivo you know what  will be recorded, you know what effect additional recordings will have on  Tivos spaces schedule, and recordings are kept as long as disk space  permits.  The Replay and Tivo forums at avsforum.com are an excellent  source of information.";ReplayTV good, Tivo much better
1;6.0;1.0;76.0;-13.35035714285712;TIVO works for some but not for others. The TIVO system is not compatable with the DISH NETWORK better receiver that operates on an FM signal instead of infared. Also it is not compatable with all TV sets and in many cases the signal is not as strong as it is without TIVO. TIVO's advertising is  misleading in that they tell you that it records 14 hours. The reality is  that it only records 4 hours at a  quality that is as good as normal TV reception. My suggestion would be to  wait till all the bugs are worked out and the hard drive capacity is  increased at an affordable price.;not for everyone
0;7.0;4.0;74.0;-451.2748243992605;I have spent the past 30 days evaluating both a ReplayTV and a Tivo personal digital recorder and this is a brief review of my experience.\nIf Tivo did not exist, I would probably tell you that ReplayTV was the coolest gadget that I have ever used. However, Tivo has done such a superior job  designing their user interface and their remote control that there is no  comparison between the two, Tivo is the hands down winner.\nReplayTV's  major problem is that they have no sorting system to help you pick the  shows that you might want to record. To find the shows that you want to  record you must painfully sift through an on screen channel guide one time  slot at a time. Tivo in comparison gives you numerous ways to choose shows  that you might want to record. You can view the upcomming two weeks of  programming in catagories such as Movies, Sports, by channel, or by show  name. Tivo will even automatically record shows that it thinks you might  like based on shows that you have rated with their thumbs up or thumbs down  rating system. At first I was skeptical that I would like this feature, but  after a week I found that I loved it. I would get home from work and get a  whole list of programs that Tivo went out and recored by itself while I was  sleeping and while I was at work.\nWith Tivo I can scan through hundreds  of Movies on my premium channels and in minutes tell it to record all the  ones that I want to record for the next two weeks. With ReplayTV it took me  so long to do this that after the first few days I found myself only  recording shows that were on a regular schedule, like Seinfeld or the  X-Files.\nReplayTV basically has a frustrating user interface that forces  you to constantly look at the remote control to do every simple task. With  Tivo almost all of your options are on screen, so if your sitting in the  dark while you are watching TV you don't have to strain your eyes on what  button you need to push.\nMy ReplayTV seemed to often (at least once a  day) have a playback glitch. The fast forward or rewind would get stuck and  I would have to power the unit on and off to get it to stop.\nOne last  thing, a major one for me, ReplayTV gives you no indication of where you  are when you are watching a show. You can't tell if there is 10 minutes or  an hour left. I was watching Shindler's List a few days ago and I found  this extremely frustrating. With Tivo you get a very helpfull progress bar  that appears on the bottom of the screen whenever you fast forward, rewind  or press slow motion. (ReplayTV has no slow motion or single frame  advance.)\nI just returned my ReplayTV and Tivo 14 hour unit, I ordered a  TIVO 30 hour unit. My advise is to buy a 30 hour unit, you will probably  record everything in a higher quality setting, resulting in about half the  recording time of either units advertised recording capacity.;Tivo vs. ReplayTV

I lovewatching an episode of Trekevery night  before slumbering. The 312 is everything the 112is but double the  recordingcapacity. Be warned that thisis not really a 30 hour unit!

66;9.0;4.0;54.0;-538.0882492113565;"This is a great, revolutionary product.  It's pretty much as great as everybody says.  I've had mine for a couple of months now and have no major complaints.  However, in case Tivo's reading, all my (minor) complaints  follow:\nTivo comes with all kinds of hardware.  Everything except a coax  splitter which you need to buy if you want to continue using the tuner on  your TV.  (Which I think would be just about everybody because you have to  do this if you want to watch live TV while Tivo's recording).\nThe Season  Pass records all showings of a particular show no matter when or what  channel it's on.  However if you pick a show that's in syndication or a  cable show that's repeated often, you'll get many more than you actually  want.  It'd be better if a Season Pass was only good for one channel and  time period.  Also be nice if it were smart enough to not record additional  showings of the same episode.  Another bad thing about this is that it will  not allow you to create other Seasons Passes if it thinks it interferes  with the first one.  (Like say you only want a Seinfeld season pass for a  4pm showing but Seinfeld also runs at 9pm on some other channel; I can't  set up a season pass for some other 9pm show without disrupting the first).  Of course the way around this is to record by time but I think some  improvements can be made.\nWhen watching live TV, it keeps the last 30  minutes UNLESS you switch channels or a new show starts.  This means that  if I stop watching (without pausing) near the end of a show and a new show  starts in the meantime, I'll have lost the ability to go back and watch the  end of the show I was watching.  I don't see why they blow away the last 30  minutes when a new show starts, particularly if it's on the same  channel.\nAs other people mentioned, it'd have been nice to have a  skip-forward feature so you could skip forward in increments of 30 seconds  or something.\nIt'd be nice to have a menu option to have a less  conspicuous play bar (or to put it at the top of the screen instead of the  bottom).  It covers up things like Who Wants to be a Millionaire questions  until it times out and disappears.\nSometimes the sound loses its top  frequencies such that it sounds like a bad speaker.  S sounds sound like  static.  This might be a function of the broadcast but live TV doesn't  sound that way.\nIt'd be great to have a VHS record list feature so you  could record multiple programs to videotape all in one go.  Sometimes I  make tapes for my  overseas friends and having to record one 1/2 hour  program at a time is a pain in the rear.\nWhen scrolling through program  listings, it makes you wait a second before bringing up the next screen.  It should be pre-loading each screen in advance so it doesn't have to waste  this kind of time.\nDue to program scheduling, many times it will miss the  last 30 seconds or so of a broadcast (so you might miss that last joke  while the credits are scrolling).  It should give you an option where it  will always record a couple of minutes before/after a program (if there  isn't another program scheduled to be recorded immediately afterwards).\nI  guess that's about it.  Don't let all this scare you away.  It's an awesome  product and now that I have it, I wouldn't watch TV any other way.";Great Product, could use some tweaks
30;10.0;5.0;44.0;-143.2745121951219;"I started out about a year or so ago with a 14 hour Tivo unit and LOVED it.  The problem was they lie about capacity... sort of.  14 hours or in the case of the 30 hour unit are really more like 6 hours and 11 hours with the recorder set to record at BEST quality...  anything lower and the picture looks bad. I then paid Tivo to send me a new unit that had been upgraded to 3 hours.... Then that was still not enough time with the system set at best quality.\nI finally found out I could upgrade the thing myself... so my recomendation is to get the cheapest on that you can and upgrade it.

My unit had problems with the IR receiver in the unit not receiving the commands. (Yes, it was the IR receiver as I have two remotes and neither worked unless you were 1-2 inches from the unit). It was over 90 days, but I had called several times on this issue and FINALLY got them to exchange it without charging me... But they do not ship the new unit until they receive the old unit.  I sent that to Texas... and received a new one within a week.  The second unit was what they called DOA (Dead on Arrival). It didn't work either. (It says refurbished on the bottom). So now I am sending it back at another shipping cost.  Another issue is that this receiver 'learns' programs, actors, directors, etc. that you like. So, with each exchange, I lose all of the info it has learned. All of this will lead me to send a letter to the President of Philips, but even getting his name took two calls. When I explained why I wanted his name to the person who answered in New York City she hung up on me...;TiVo-Mine has died twice

It normally takes less than 10 minutes to hook up.  You will have to program it upon the first use which will require a 2-3  hour call to a 1-800 number. You can leave TiVo unattended once it starts.  There after TiVo will call a local or 1-800 number to update its listings  and content daily.\nIn my experience TiVo's Customer Care is very good if  your TiVo should develop a problem.;Live the future of TV now, get a TiVo!
69;13.0;5.0;44.0;-669.6965999999999;Some thought HDTV would change the world of TV but promise that is still left unfulfilled.  I would argue that personalized TV, not higher definition, is really what will change the TV medium in the future.  Why  waste time being forced to watch what you have no interest in?  Do you  really want to see that ad with the guy going through the car wash in a  tent in higher definition or would you rather just skip it  altogether?\nLike the Replay, TiVo is one of the first electronic devices  that delivers on this promise.  This is unlike any other component you have  in your AV system and is lightyears of different from a cable/satellite  control box since this is an actual computer, running a real OS, with a  real hard drive.  What does this mean to you?  High quality recording,  recommendations, personalized settings, automatically receive new  features.\nThe configuration of the TiVo box was incredibly  straightforward and easy so that even the most non-technical person you  know can set it up.  The only problem with setting up the TiVo is figuring  out how to wire it up to all your other components.  For the average  consumer this won't be a problem since their setup is relatively standard  and covered in the manual.  However if you have TV, VCR, cable box, DVD, AV  Receiver, etc. you will need to spend some time thinking about how to best  run the wires.\nThe initial configuration takes about 20 minutes of your  time and then it dials into TiVo to get your channel lineup and program  guide.  This is a short, one-time call that is followed by a 1 to 2 hour  initial indexing of all the information to make it easy for you to find  things.  The time it takes to index is based upon the number of channels  your TV/cable/satellite system supports so if you actually only use a small  set of channels then the indexing is much faster.\nI almost never watch  live TV anymore as I usually just pick something that the TiVo has already  recorded.  At Best Quality there is no visual degredation of the signal by  running the signal through the box even when watching live TV.  The  benefits of pausing, rewinding, etc. are just too good to miss out on.  If  you are trying to watch live TV you do pay a penalty of being about a  second behind the actual broadcast...but who really cares about such a  small time delay?\nThe TiVo will automatically record shows it thinks you  will like.  I have had mixed success with this.  It has recorded some  interesting shows for me.  It has also recorded shows that it previously  recorded and I explicitly deleted.  Of course you can always negatively  rate the show instead of deleting so it doesn't show up again but how that  impacts your overall TiVo recommendations is unknown.\nThere is no guide  that comes with the TiVo that tells you how to make optimal use of the  thumbs up/thumbs down feature.  You can give a show up to 3 thumbs up or  thumbs down so you do have flexability but it is unclear what the  difference between 1 thumbs up and two thumbs up are.  The recommendations  can certainly be improved but I think with more people using the service  that these will only get better over time.\nAnother downside is that the  interaction with Digital cable box is less than satisfactory.  You change  channels on TiVo and not all IR commands are received by cable box. This is  mostly not TiVo's fault since the cable box does not properly queue IR  commands.  However TiVo should allow you to specify IR delays in some sort  of advanced menu.\nOn the good side all the problems I have with the TiVo  can be corrected by them through future software releases.  The TiVo  company has been great at responding to customers and focusing on solving  the problems that gives the biggest win to the consumer.\nAll in all this  is a really solid product for being an early entrant into personal TV  technology.  Even at this point I don't think I could live without the  TiVo.  Even though I don't watch much TV is has saved me significant time  since I can fast forward through anything that is slow, boring, or  advertistements and I don't have to worry about rushing home to watch shows  in real time.;Never watch live TV again!
2;14.0;5.0;45.0;-239.71728915662646;So, what does this thing do?  Well, on the surface, it's a digital VCR -- it records programs that you want to watch and it lets you see them without juggling tapes.  But it's so much more:\no  It makes live TV as flexible  as recorded TV.  It's always recording, so if you want to pause live TV  (yes, even when you're not specifically recording something), just push  pause.  You can tend to something else and come back without missing a  beat.  You can also rewind, instant replay, freeze frame or slow mo at any  time.  While you're doing all this, TiVo is diligently recording TV and you  can catch up at your first opportunity (maybe during a commercial  <grin>).\no  It's a program guide -- TiVo downloads program guides  for all of your stations, so you can see what's on for the next 10 days.  You can also search for program titles and record any program that you  find.\no  Because of the program guide, it's a super VCR.  Tell TiVo that  you always want to record a show and it will record it whenever it plays on  that channel.  Special one hour show on a different day?  No problem.  TiVo  will automatically capture that.\no  As TiVo gets to know you, it will  even record shows that you might like (it will never erase something that  you have recorded or otherwise interfere with your TV watching), but based  on shows you have asked TiVo to record in the past, it will record the  occasional show that you might also enjoy.  And if you don't like something  that TiVo suggests, you can easily let TiVo know and you'll never see it  again.\no  The software is updated over the phone, so you don't have to  worry about being left behind -- any improvements in the system will be  automatically sent to you and applied to your system.\nIt's simply an  amazing product!;The Coolest Thing Since the VCR
10;15.0;3.0;31.0;-193.77123711340198;I wasn't sure whether to give this Philips Tivo zero stars or five stars. Zero stars because the quality stinks. Five stars because it's such an amazing product.\nOn the negative side, the modem on my Tivo went dead in just six months. After reading all the Amazon reviews, it appears that this is a VERY common problem that can't be ignored. It wouldn't be so bad if the warranty weren't so short and if Philips/Tivo support weren't so completely incompetent. It's now been five weeks and they still haven't returned my Tivo -- even though I had to pay for them to fix it! I'm told the delay is because they ran out of refurbished units to send me. I don't find that an acceptable excuse.\nSince I still believe that Tivo is the most amazing invention since the personal computer, I still definitely recommend you buy one.  Besides, it's not Tivo, but Philips that seems to have the quality problem (I'm not sure how the Sony versions rate on quality).\nBut there are some steps you should take if you buy one:\nFirst, buy the extended warranty plan that most stores offer. You'll pay extra, but it will still be less then paying $100 for Philips to fix it. And store warranties last 3 years, unlike the awful 3 months labor, 1 year parts warranty that you get from Philips.\nSecond, buy a special power strip that includes inputs for cable and telephone lines. This will stop any power surges from hitting your Tivo, which is what I suspect is causing a lot of these failures. (My Tivo died after during a mild thunderstorm.)\nGood luck!;READ THIS before you buy and SAVE A LOT OF TROUBLE!
36;16.0;5.0;38.0;-275.90390052356014;"I am an early adopter of Tivo and it has completely changed the way that I watch TV.  I'm glad that people are finally catching on to what I've been saying for over a year which is:  TIVO IS THE COOLEST THING EVER.  The main thing that I hear from people when I try to explain the benefits of owning a Tivo is ""But I have a VCR - why would I want this?""  I have put together a brief list of the benefits of owning a Tivo for you non-believers.\n1. I, too, own a VCR.  And with all the good intentions in the world of taping programs that I wanted to see - I NEVER DID.\n2. Aren't you sick of missing your favorite TV shows?  With Tivo you will never miss your favorite shows again - in addition, my little Tivo friend may help you find new favorite shows.\n3. Don't you hate commercials as much as the next guy?  With Tivo, you will never be forced to sit through another minute of those crappy commercials.  You will not even know what people are talking about as they discuss the new Bud commercial...you'll merely shake your head and know that those poor, unfortunate souls don't have a Tivo at home.\n4.  Don't you ever have to go to the bathroom in the middle of watching something?  I won't elaborate on that one - but wouldn't it be nice to pause your TV to jump up and answer the phone, grab a snack, etc... without having to worry about what you're going to miss.\n5.  You'll rent less movies.  Which also means that you'll save more money.  Forget renting.  Just pay for the premium channels that you were always to cheap to pay for before because you figured that you'd never watch that many movies.  Now you can watch them all.\nSo, to sum up my little Tivo review - I have to say that you will completely streamline the way you watch TV when you get a Tivo.  Stop torturing yourself with the network's schedule that doesn't fit your schedule and make up your own.  With Tivo there is always something good on...what YOU want to watch.";Tivo is the best invention since sliced bread
73;17.0;4.0;40.0;-140.22948275862066;"I love Tivo!  It is a wonderful product and for the most part, delivers as promised.  Unfortunately, I have had a series of problems with my receiver.  Software problems occurred almost immediately.  Through a number of  conversations with TIVO and Phillips personnel, I received relief.  Within  three months of buying the product,  the hard drive died.  Again, the  people at Tivo were wonderful, if not a bit bureaucratic (I had to speak  with a series of people).  What I would not accept, and you shouldn't  either, is a rebuilt product!  In fact, the warranty states they have the  right to give you a rebuilt machine, in the first 90 days after your  purchase.  After that time period, they have the right to charge you for  labor.  This warranty is good for one year; at which time you are on your  own.  This is one lousy warranty!  Tivo is a product without moving  parts.  Being an enclosed box, the consumer cannot touch or manipulate the  machine.  Therefore, if something goes wrong with Tivo, it is not the fault  of the consumer!  I hope the decision makers at Phillips read this review  and change their warranty. The next generation of people who want to buy  this fine product deserve a fair warranty.  The  people at Tivo and  Phillips have been great to deal with.  Their warranty should be as good as  their people!";great but here's what you should know
29;18.0;5.0;34.0;-49.75499999999997;I compared TiVo with my friends Replay and Microsofts WebTV versions, and Tivo is by far the best.  Replay is not as user friendly, with the remote a bit awkward.  Also Replay is very loud, and the clicking of the hard drive can be quite bothersome, especially if you have it in your bedroom.\nTiVo's layout is very intuitive and can easily be used.  The recording menu is very simple that I didn't even have to read the manual to understand how it works.  I've had my TiVo for over a year and a half now, and it runs smoothly with no problems or glitches.  It did not crash on me or miss a program yet,  (maybe because it is using the Linux based OS).\nI love Microsoft but WebTV is not up to par with the quality and consistency as Tivo.  I love this product.\n-Mar;Best New Product Out There
41;19.0;3.0;36.0;-127.10189655172411;"Here are thee shortcomings as I have seen them over the past year with  TiVo: 1) It is very sensitive to power surges or little brown-outs. When  the lights blink off in the house, the TiVo tends to lock up, and this  'frozen state' can only be reversed by unplugging it for a few secs and  then plugging it back in and waiting for it to cycle through its start-up  menu (2 mins). 2) ""Pause"", which is by far the coolest thing  about TiVo for me (like ""pizza guy knocks, don't want to miss this  next play""), is pretty time-limited. After 30 mins of pause, it starts  playing again. Once it starts playing again, you cannot get all the way  back to where you paused it. 3) ""Record"" is nice, but nowhere  near 30 hours at any resolution you could stand to watch. Even at the best  resolution, the picture is seriously degraded from the original. 4) I'm  getting a little tired of the $9.95 per month. I know I agreed to it, but  it really seems a little too much, considering I paid for the hardware and  the menu (which is what the $9.95 is supposed to be for) is no better than  what my digital cable provider or DSS system provides.\nOverall, I like  it, but it should be improved before getting 5 stars from anyone.";Great Idea, Still Needs Work.
52;20.0;5.0;35.0;-134.95613733905577;In the past twenty years I've purchased thousands of dollars worth of A/V and PC equipment.  At $399 plus $10 per month for the programming, TiVo is my favorite.  OK, if I want to spend hours every week programming my VCR  (of which I own five), I can record all my favorite shows, but why bother  when TiVO does a much better job virtually automatically.  Since I  purchased Tivo in April, I haven't recorded anything on the VCR's.  I still  use them occasionally to play a rental movie not available on DVD.  For  those of you that may complain about the $10/month (or $200 one time)  charge for the programming data service, I would suggest that this is a  minor cost compared to what you are probably paying for cable or direct tv,  AND I would submit that the TiVo service will greatly enhance your ability  to utilize and manage the 50 to 250 channels that are available with cable  or satellite.\nDo I watch alot more TV than I did before?  Not really, but  now I always have something to watch that I'm interested in rather than  just watching what happens to be currently broadcasted.\nDid I consider  Replay?  Yes, also a nice product, but for my needs TiVO is better.  Will  the price drop by Christmas?  Probably, but at $399 why wait?

90;21.0;5.0;34.0;-141.23451882845185;I buy every gadget that is available.  90% do not become part of my daily routine and are put in basement.  I purchased TiVo not knowing what to expect.  This device is the most amazing gadget to ever come around.  If  TiVo sudendly costed $10,000 and ours broke I would replace it without  thinking twice.  Once you watch TV through Tivo you never ever will go  back.  I don't watch much network TV and mostly watch financial stuff,  MoneyLine, NBR, football game.  With this device I watch these shows when I  feel like it.  I never miss them.  I watch the football game in 1 1/4 hours  using fastforward.  I have 5 kids under 8 and they store their Pokemon on  the device and no longer is there any rewiding, finding a tape.  It is a  revolutionairy device.  This device will be standard part of a TV at some  point, everyone will have one.  Our TiVo has worked perfectly and has never  needed to be rebooted.  Only improvement is that it can't handle two season  passes that conflict from time to time and it records every ER when you  really only want the one at 9:00 on Thursdays.  You have to manually put in  the time and channel.  I bet both of these will be fixed through software  at some time.  It does automatic software updates at night over the  phoneline so no hassle.;It is the most amazing product ever
87;22.0;5.0;33.0;-56.41850931677017;Although it stil suffers from many early, bleeding edge problems, the TIVO HDR312 is absolutely terrific!  I find the online guides to be easier to use than my sat. receivers, and love being able to watch TV whenever I  want.  I work CRAZY hours (who doesn't these days), and love coming home to  find that the TIVO has dutifully recorded my programs - and am often  delighted that it (through its suggestions) recorded shows it thought I  might like.\nThe one area that the TIVO falls short in is that it does  not allow you to jump to an arbitrary time index.  If you recorded a 3 hour  movie, it will take you 120 seconds to fast forward to the 2 hour mark.  Although that is VERY lame, I ave started to loby Tivo to add that in a  future software update.  Also, the Linux Operating System is at the guts of  the TIVO - yet another compelling reason to own this!;Not to be clich - TIVO has changed my life!
17;23.0;2.0;26.0;-170.1183636363636;We hooked up TiVo about six months ago.  It took a few hours to set up and download all the info, but then it was working great.  Our one problem initially - sometimes it doesn't like to communicate channel changes to the cable box.  So you'll put channel 4 into the remote, and TiVo says you're on channel 4, but you're still watching 36.  Very annoying.  Don't know whether that's TiVo or Philips, so there's a chance that Sony may be better.\nSecond problem, sometimes TiVo can't display a channel.  You'll flipping along, and suddenly, sometimes for hours at a time, it just won't show one or more channels.  Very irritating, and as far as I know, there's no way to fix it.\nOther than those two occasional things, we were very happy with it.  I love being able to pause live TV, rewind live TV, and record things without having to remember that day to leave a tape in.  It's also great to be able to watch stuff later without all the commercials.\nBut then three days ago, I turned on the TV and there was no sound.  We unplug TiVo, plug it back in, and everything's fine.  So it's done that about 15 times over the last three days.  So we call them last night and we are told it's probably the sound card.  Send the unit to Philips and they'll either fix it or send you a new one for ....  Are you kidding me?  So right now, I'm about ready to throw TiVo out the window.;Neat, but a lot of bugs.
84;24.0;5.0;32.0;-82.13603351955302;I've had my 30-hour TiVo now since last summer, and it just gets better and better.  It's easy, the picture quality is great, and the content provided from the TiVo service is worth much more than the $199 lifetime  fee.  I've gotten to the point where I consider it a real pain to actually  have to record a program on the VCR.\nI got a sneak peak at the Consumer  Electronics Show in Las Vegas of the newest version of the TiVo software,  which is due to be downloaded to every subscriber free of charge this  summer, and it takes the ease of use and flexibility factor to an even  higher level.  And with TiVo's partnerships with the pay cable folks,  DirectTV, and now Blockbuster, this technology certainly looks poised to  take off.  Add to that Sony's announcement of a lower priced 30 hour  machine, and it looks like it will get more affordable as well.  I have  this Philips unit, and it has performed without even a hickup since I set  it up.;It Will Change the Way You Watch TV
70;25.0;5.0;31.0;-144.83580645161285;Just to begin by replying to a previous review... The fact that TiVo is on all the time is good!  This prevents wear on the system and the hard drive.  Think about your computer, all the experts  advise leaving it on instead constantly turning it on and off... I  bought my TiVo recently and Amazon just credited me with the price  difference since the TiVo just dropped in price dramatically. The  TiVo set-up was long, but simple.  The 800 number was assuring since  I don't live in a major metropolitan area. I got the lifetime  subscription and the $100 Direct TV rebate, so I wound up paying a  lot less for my unit overall than for the competition which I checked  out.  There are no long distance calls with TiVo! I don't save  anytime during the day, I still watch 5 hours of TV every night, but  now it's quality TV, not just channel surfing.  I can also watch more  good tv in less time, you can quickly scan through commercials, like  a VCR, but you can do it while recording the item.  If you start  watching a show about 6 to 7 minutes in, while recording it on your  TiVo, you can skip the commercials while watching and catch up to  live TV without missing anything!  It's really easy too!  And now the  same price as a good VCR, but it's much better.  I'm the envy of all  my techie-friend!  END;Great product, new low price, Amazon was helpful

(I ask you this, Why pay for service when the Panasonic  Showstopper with ReplayTV does not charge)\n2) Once a show is recorded to  move through commercials you must fast forward.(Pansonic Showstopper with  ReplayTV has a 30 second quickskip feature, average commercial is 30  seconds)\n3) The channel guide is very complicated and very hard to  navigate( Remember DOS) Panasonic showstopper with Replay TV's channel  guide is very easy to navigate and looks alot like Preview Guide on most  cable companies)\nI guess what I'm saying is I didn't want to pay another  bill so I bought the Panasonic Showstopper with ReplayTV and I love it!

16;27.0;1.0;23.0;-52.933453237410035;My husband gave me a Tivo for Christmas and we loved this product.  However it turns out that the technology is still in a developing stage.  The Tivo died this week with a green serious error screen.  Phillips has a 90 day labor 1 year parts warranty so for $99 plus shipping they will send a refurbished unit.  This is very expensive considering what we paid for the unit just a few months ago and considering that the refurbished unit will carry the same very limited warranty.  I would not buy this product without an extended warranty because these units have a 1 in 33 failure rate in the first year for the hard drive and also a high failure rate for the modem.  Otherwise wait a few years for a new manufacturer, more developed technology, or better warranty.;1 in 33 failure rate
22;28.0;3.0;23.0;-187.87388111888106;While I have had Tivo for over 14 months I am in the position that I feel I need to discontinue due to several reasons.\nThere have been several prblems with freezing that I would have to unplug and restart the process.  If it does this while you are gone obviously nothing is recorded.\nThe main reason is the customer support.\nOnce your unit goes pass 90 days expect no help from Tivo in getting your system working.  They wil only tell you that you will have to pay $99.95 to get it fixed or replaced.  Over the past year there have been 9 incidents that have forced me to call customer support, and I am not a novice when it comes to electronics, and all they could say was unplug it, wait 5 minutes and restart.\nSO even after 9 problems Tivo takes no responsibility for the unit and tells me they wil work with me and cover half the expenses but I wil still need to send in $99.95.\nWell paying $100.00/yr for service and then plan on paying another $99.95 every year when there is a problem seems like an expense I don't feel like covering.\nTivo to me seems not to care about serving there customers once they get past the 90 day mark.  I would think a company that is starting up and now gaining new competitors would be more interested in gaining customer support than pushing away customers but that was not the case in my situation.\nIn conclusion, I loved the service and will miss it dearly but I am not comfortable with a company that will not stick up for its product.;Hope you don't have problems after 90 days
28;29.0;5.0;23.0;-1014.1824523160761;"Anyone that is thinking of purchasing a TiVo unit from Phillips or Sony should completely ignore the review submitted by KeithKi.  He apparently has no idea how to use his TiVo unit or did extremely poor research prior to purchasing it.  I wold like to answer each of his points;\nAnd now for the drawbacks of tivo (which far surpasses the good things).\n1. Unless you have a newer tv with 2 video inputs, you can't record one show, while viewing another.\nCorrect, and you can't do it with a VCR either.  No where does TiVo make the claim that you can record one show while watching another.  What you can do is watch a recorded show while another one is recorded.  Can a VCR do that?  NO!\n2. You can only rewind live tv back to the point where you changed the channel. This means that if you change the channel to Leno and just barely miss the punchline... too bad, you can't rewind.\nObviously the unit can only buffer the last 30 minutes of the channel you have been watching, if you expected it to buffer every channel you have on the off-chance you might channel surf over to it you made another huge mistake during your research.\n3. You can only pause for a max of 30 mins.\nWell if you are pausing for 30 minutes perhaps you should be recording it instead.\n4. You can only rewind to a max of 30 mins, UNLESS the show is being recorded, in which case you can rewind all the way to the beginning of the recording.\nAgain, you clearly have no idea how this unit operates.  It buffers the last 30 minutes of the channel you are watching.  What you stated is true, whats the problem?\n5. If you are watching tv behind real time and want to change the channel for a few minutes, when you come back to the show you were watching, it'll resume at real time and you can't rewind, so you'll have missed however much time you were behind.\nSee response to #2 and add you have no idea how this unit works.\n6. The ""Season Pass"" function is supposed to record the selected show no matter what time it plays and no matter what channel. I got a season pass for Spin City, but I had to set 2 Season Passes... one for channel 13 and the other for channel 7 in order for it to work correctly.\nThe new version of the TiVo software offers much broader control over the Season Pass, and whats the problem with two Season Passes?  When you select the Season Pass it clearly states which channel it will be recording from.  The new software allows for recording only first run episodes or all reruns as well.  YOu can prioritize Season Passes should there be a conflict between several shows so TiVO will record the higher priority show.\n7. The Thumbs Up/Down system doesn't work very well. For some reason I end up with more Fresh Prince of Bel Air (3 thumbs up) than Spin City (which I have a season pass for). Also, my tivo likes to record practically every movie on Sundance even though I give every single one of those movies 3 thumbs down.\nIt takes several weeks for the Thumbs Up/Down feature to begin to accurately predict what you may like/dislike.  You can also tell the unit not to record the suggestions but rather review a list of them and decide which ones you want to record and delete the ones you don't want.\n8. Since the tivo box is ALWAYS on, there's no way for it to tell if you're actually there watching tv. So in the middle of a show a message will pop up asking to change the channel so that it can record a ""tivo suggestion."" Sometimes this is a hassle to find the remote and select ""cancel recording and stay on this channel."" Also, if you're listening to the tv, but not actually watching it, you may miss the pop up message, in which case it will automatically change the channel and start recording. This means, that you have to cancel the recording, and then switch back to the channel you were on, therefore missing part of the show you were listening to.\nAgain,  turn off the Suggestions from being recorded.  You really need to learn how to use the TiVo unit.\n9. Sometimes you'll be watching a show (which is not being recorded) and something really spectacular or funny will happen. You would think that you could rewind and then hit record, so that you could show it to somebody later. But when you hit record, it'll start recording from live tv to the end of the show. This is also the same problem if you have live tv paused. Let's say the phone rings, so you pause the show you're watching. You realize that you're going to be on the phone for longer than 30 mins, so you hit record. When you go back to watch the show, you'll find that it didn't record from the point it was paused at, but rather the point of live tv when you hit record.\nThe new version of the software allows you to record the buffer and begin recording the show, problem solved!\n10. Shows are recorded based on the tivo programming guide which is downloaded over your phone line. This means that many times you will miss the intro or last joke of a recorded show. Or if a game goes into overtime, yep, that's right you miss the whole overtime. Of course you can always record manually by setting a time period, but that's kind of a hassle.\nThe new version of the TiVo software allows you to pad the recording time in order to capture shows that may run over, like Survivor running over by 2-3 minutes.  Of course nobody can predict if a sporting event will go into overtime so you're going to miss the overtime with a VCR or a TiVo.\nI am extremely happy with my Sony Tivo, it performs as advertised and makes watching TV a new experience.  If you just take the time to fully learn what TiVo can do you will see that it far surpasses both VCRs and its own advertising.\nI hope this clears up the inaccuracies in the review posted by KeithKi.\nBruce";Response to KeithKi on TiVo

It took about four hours to do the complete install but only about 20-30  minutes of this required me to be there.  If you buy one, try to set it up  as early in the day as possible so you won't have the agonizing wait  overnight to try it out. Setting up recordings, watching shows, pausing,  etc. are all incredibly easy but very powerful.

As none of the example set-ups in the TIVO manual remotely matched mine,  and despite the fact that normally I'm pretty good at this type of thing,  after about three hours of complete failure, I was positively stumped.  I  finally had to call TIVO's customer care support.  And this is where I am  SO very impressed!  I was absolutely blown away when the TIVO  representative stayed ON the phone for over an hour with me as I crawled  behind my entertainment center with a flashlight and my cordless phone,  with various cables in my teeth!  ;-)  She walked me through every step and  with persistence and effort on both our parts, finally we got everything  hooked up and ""talking to"" each other.  I've never experienced  customer service like this before on anything I've ever bought.  Amazing!  And as for the TIVO and how it is working now - great and I love it!  Only  thing I didn't like was the fact TIVO/Philips have truly overlooked the  customer's with home entertainment systems, calling a set up like mine,  ""advanced"" - from what I can tell more and more consumers are  going to the ""advanced"" systems so it would be good to see TIVO  include hookup examples for ""advanced"" systems in their future  product manuals.";Amazing Set-Up Assistance!

Setup is extremely simple and Tivo provides excellent setup guidelines and user manuals.  The first  setup call is lengthy but Tivo warns you of this before you start.  The  maintenance calls vary in length but the actual call time is short although  the computer may do some ""housekeeping"" that takes longer.  For  those concerned about recording time, I made some trial recordings as  suggested by Tivo and found the ""best"" quality (9 hours total  time) to be indistinguishable from live TV.  The ""high"" quality  was still excellent and better than my VCR at SP.  I now use  ""medium"" quality for all my recordings except for anything that I  wish to archive onto VCR or sporting events that may require finer detail.  This gives me over 19 hours of recording time.  Hopefully, Tivo will  provide easy upgrades of their hardware just like they do their software.  Finally, the user interface for Tivo is amazing.  It is extremely  user-friendly; I was immediately running Tivo without looking at the manual  and the variety of ways Tivo has sorted programming makes deciding what you  want to watch simple.  No more TV Guides!  Tivo sorts programming by  channel, time, genres, showcases, and the Tivolution daily magazine  delivered to the receiver every night in the update call has even more  topical recommendations.  And the ""Thumbs up"" or ""Down""  really works.  Tivo makes fairly good calls about programming you might  enjoy and records them on available space leaving you to decide if you want  to watch them.  If you do and tell Tivo you liked the show with the  ""Thumbs up"", Tivo learns again!  Our television viewing has never  been the same.  For copyright reasons though, you can't make digital  archives of your recorded programs.  That seems strange to me since analog  copies are fine!  I highly recommend the Tivo personal receiver system!";Worth its weight in gold!
38;33.0;5.0;24.0;-68.958453038674;Just wanted to put in my two cents about the reviews here that mention  poor picture quality.  I read these reviews before I bought the unit and  insisted that I be able to see it in action before buying it.  I found that  the poor picture quality seems to only come through when the signal is sent  through the TV tuner (channel 3 or 4).  Using the direct line in to the TV  produced a clear, sharp picture.  I feel this is important to keep in mind  for videophiles like me who want to get our money's worth out of the video  products we buy.\nThe Tivo concept is great.  Now that the unit has  learned my preferences, I can't wait to get home from work each evening to  see what it's recorded for me.  I find myself watching less and less live  TV since Tivo has recorded the shows I want to watch.  I have both cable  and DSS, so there's lots to choose from.  It's nice not to have to weed  through it all.;Can't live without it!

Still, it's an excellent service.";A must have!

You can quicky see in 1 screen the stuff you  asked for and the stuff it got for you.\nYou can start watching a program  before its done recording.  No more missing the first 20 minutes or waiting  until its finished to watch!\nNot only does it have a default record  quality, but you can select it for every recorded show.  Theres no reason  to record a talk show at best quality and you would never record an action  movie at the worst.  you don't need to compromise any recording.\nAnd you  can tell it how long save the recorded items!  It helps you manage the  storage very well without even trying.  I would say I get a good 20 hours  without compromising the quality.\nI thought I had a great onscreen tv  guide with my cable company.  Since this unit nightly transfers the guide,  EVERY show has a rating and a description.  You know what te rating is the  second you change channels, you know the program name, the channel name and  the time the show is on (not to mention the current time).  I didn't like  the monthly fee but now that I see how its better than your cable company,  its no big deal.\nOh and you can search by name to record stuff.  Great  for finding those shows you know exist but never home to catch when they  are.\nIf you never know when you are going to be home next, you need this  product.  If you have friends over for sports shows.. you need this.  If  you keep getting phone calls and never get to watch your favorite program,  you need this.

The ability to pause and rewind live TV is nice, but I find that with TiVo, I rarely watch live TV anymore at  all.  TiVo knows what shows I want to watch, and it makes sure they're  available whenever I want to watch them.\nI also have to mention that the  documentation is among the best I've ever seen with a consumer-electronics  product.  It's extremely well written and thorough, and even though TiVo  setup can be complex, the guide presents several different scenarios with  clear instructions for each.\nThis is how everyone will watch TV in a few  years.;TiVo is everything I'd hoped it would be

I can start watching  television anytime, day or night, and TIVO has all my favorite ready for me  to watch...it also has a few other shows that I didn't specify to record,  but thanks to it's Thumbs Up/Down technology, it has learned what I like  and records things that are similar... The way I watch television will  never be the same because of TIVO. In terms of setup, I found it to be  relatively simple.  The hardest part is waiting for TIVO to configure  itself to my cable sytem.  Plugging in TIVO is no different than plugging  in a VCR.  Easy instructions were included and the 1-800 number included  put my mind at ease. TIVO is great!;TIVO is my new best friend

However, I have had three units fail because of the extensively discussed TiVo modem issue.  If you have not had a hardware problem yet, then you are fortunate.\nPlease don't take my word for it--evaluate the hardware issues for yourself by browsing the excellent TiVo forum ... prior to purchasing a unit, for very helpful advice.  Read the FAQs and try searching for ""dead modem.""\nApparently the modem is highly sensitive to any power fluctuation in the telephone line, and is very easily burned out.  Because the modem is built as part of the TiVo chip, it cannot simply be replaced with a better modem.\nIf you decide to purchase a TiVo unit, be sure to buy from a reliable merchant (reports about Amazon are good) and also purchase an iron-clad extended warranty.  Otherwise, after 90 days, all Phillips TiVo repairs are $99.\nSorry to be so negative about the hardware, but I will repeat that the TiVo service itself is terrific!";Great concept but deeply flawed hardware

When I powered on the unit, it took me a few seconds to realize  that my VCR input needed to be set to ""Line"" before I could see  the TiVo screens. The on-screen guided setup procedure went without a  hitch; the most difficult and time-consuming part was determining the  remote control codes to allow the TiVo remote to turn on both my TV and  Stereo system at the same time. I also had a few false starts configuring  the system to control my cable box. The first time TiVo dialed into the  main computer, the actual connection lasted only about 15 minutes, but TiVo  busily sorted and indexed the downloaded information for about 2 1/2 hours.  The system is so quiet, that if it weren't for the green light on the  front, I'd have no idea it was even powered on. The software and the  screens are well designed and very user friendly. I have friend who can  barely change the channels on his TV using a remote control, and he was  easily able to navigate the system and program it to record his favorite  shows (I've been giving demos to all of my friends). The system can  automatically update its own software every day, so I imagine there are  many more features coming soon. Everyone I show TiVo to has some great  suggestions for improvements, and I hope to see some of them in future  versions. To summarize in 2 words: Buy it.

That all sounds good in theory, but the amazing things is that it is better in practice!  I don't watch a lot of  TV so when I watch it I want it to be good, that is exactly what TiVo gives  me.  I don't watch more TV, I watch better TV.  People are under the  impression that this product is for people addicted to TV, I think of it as  just the opposite, it is for people who like some TV but don't want to be a  slave to it.\nI know quite a few people who own it now and every single  one of them is very happy with it.

91;41.0;5.0;22.0;-333.6935321100917;"I bought the TiVo machine with the thought that it would be a fun toy, another gadget to play with.  As it turns out, it has become a ""need"" rather than just a ""want.""  We don't use our VCR  anymore to record programs or movies from our TV.  TiVo has taken its  place.  We still use the VCR for playing movies we rent in tape form, but  for taping shows that broadcast during hours we are not home, TiVo has  become our TV library.  It is very easy to use.  You program it with the  remote to record what you want.  You can then bring up a screen with the  remote which lists all the shows that have been recorded and you click on  the show you want;  no rewinding tape and waiting and trying to find the  spot where that show starts and this show ends on your videotape.  You just  click on the show from the list TiVo brings up, like you would for bringing  up a file from your computer. TiVo also gives you a complete TV guide with  descriptions of shows. It also is great for watching live TV shows. If you  want to take a break from watching a show that is being broadcast live,  (you have to go to the bathroom, or one of the kids is crying, or someone  calls or comes to your door, or whatever), TiVo will allow you to record  the show you are watching live with a click of the remote and you can come  back a half hour later and begin watching the show from where you left off.  This machine does so many things that we have gotten used to using, that I  believe, eventually everyone will have one as another part of the TV  accessories. I am sure this machine/service will become part of the  TV/internet/telephone combination being established.  One complaint is the  remote for those that have a cable box is a little slower than the remote  you are given by the cable companies.  Otherwise, TiVo is a major thumbs up  and something you will enjoy immensely. I don't have time to watch a lot of  TV with three kids and a busy schedule, but when I do I want to be able to  watch what I want rather than what is being put out by the different  broadcasters and TiVo makes it really easy to paly the shows I want when I  have the time.

72;42.0;5.0;21.0;-46.15715231788077;I was going to wait to buy the 30 hour TIVO. But I just could not stand it.  And I am glad I did not wait.  I have direct tv and it interfaces easily with a data cable.  Installation was simple though lengthy.  Plan on  about 3 hours of setup of which 20 minutes must be attended.  The menus are  easy to navigate and the thing NEVER crashes (unlike Windows).  Resolution  is pretty good at the 18 hr capacity unless you watch alot of sports then  the 14 hr capacity is fine.  Drawbacks:  Setup takes a while.  Sometimes  the wait for the Tv menu listing can take a while, minor problem.  Must  leave your DSS box powered up all the time to record.

I still say: GET A TIVO!!\n\nThere's not much one can add to 100 other reviews about TiVo.  All I can say is, if you don't have one, you don't know what you're missing.  Deciding whether or not to buy a Personal TV Recorder, which is what they  are called, is a ""no-brainer."" BUY ONE!  The only decision is  whether to buy TiVo (versons sold by Phillips and Sony) or ReplayTV (sold  by Panasonic).\n\nBoth systems require that they call in by local  telephone call each night to download program information about the  channels you receive locally, either by cable, satellite (Dish/DirecTV) or  antenna, and both charge for that service.  ReplayTV sells for about $200  more than TiVo, because the ReplayTV subscription charge is included in the  purchase price.  TiVo sells for about $200 less, but you must buy the  subscription.  The total cost is essentially the same.\n\nOne advantage to  TiVo, that ReplayTV doesn't offer, is that you can also elect to subscribe  to TiVo by the month ($10) or year ($100) if you don't want to shell out up  front the $200 for the life-of-the-TiVo subscription.  ReplayTV  subscriptions are for machine life only. Both lifetime subscriptions are  tranferable to new owners, so you can sell it or give it to your kids when  the next PTVR generation comes along.\n\nEach consumer will have to make  up his or her own mind about which system to buy, but I urge you not be  misled by explanations saying ReplayTV subscriptions are ""free,""  and TiVo subscriptions are more costly.

I hope someone considering buying TiVo will overlook some of the bad press and instead focus on the overwhelming positive comments. Even after two years, TiVo has never disappointed me and continues to amaze me. I've heard ""skeptics"" say they could do the same thing with their computer. Unlikely.  The proprietary software TiVo uses cannot be copied onto a PC.  And the software is everything.  The software is phenomenal. Every time TiVo records a show I didn't ask it to - based soley on what it (correctly) thinks I might like - I think how magnificent this thing is. And it gets better all the time. The software developers at TiVo are CONSTANTLY improving it - sending updates over the modem.  There are features now I can't live without that weren't there when I bought it!  Try doing THAT with a VCR or DVD player.  Unfortunately, words can simply do no justice to this miracle of a box called TiVo.  Only demonstrations seem to be the ultimate convincer. I've personally ""convinced"" 10 others to buy TiVo through demonstrations. Those that weren't convinced never saw a live demonstration.  They just couldn't get their minds around the concept I guess.  But for those of you on this sight, you've already gotten over the biggest hurdle.

TIVO is the next thing after the vcr, once it catches on everyone will want it.\nBasically TIVO is a really smart VCR. You watch TV and use the thumbs up and thumbs down buttons on the remote to tell tivo what shows you like and don't like. TIVO uses these suggestions and an internal TV Guide that it downloads everyday to figure out what shows you might like to watch. TIVO uses all this info to determine shows that you might like and records them.\nTIVO also has features to manually record and a Season Pass feature. The Season Pass is a feature where you tell tivo the name of a show and then TIVO automatically records this show anytime it is on.

For example, ther are no tapes to fumble through, and setup is far  easier than any VCR.  My only regret was that I ordered the fourteen hour  Tivo.  I should have ordered the thirty hour version, and still may do so.  In that case, I would move the fourteen hour machine to another TV in my  home. Tivo is so much more conveinent to use, better quality recordings,  and with no tape search. Tivo is far easier to use than any VCR I have  owned.  When nature calls, or if you want a snack, simply pause what you  are watching, and come back to where you left off.  No hassles rewinding  tape, or checking what tape number you left off on.  Simply hit play, and  you are back where you left off.  One more thing.  When Tivo is paused or  in slow motion, the screen does not shake or jitter.  The screen (picture)  is actually veiewable!  Hats off to Philips for coming up with a truly  groundbreaking advance to television veiwing, and recording.  Tivo is the  future, and a purchase that I would recommend to anyone contemplating a VCR  purchase. Instead look very seriously at Tivo, you will be extremely  satisfied, gauranteed!;tivo

Whenever we're ready to watch TV, we sit down, look at what Tivo has recorded for us, pick the show we're most interested in, and watch it. Owning a Tivo is literally life-altering: we watch stuff on TV that we really want to see... not just the stuff that happens to be on when we sit down to watch.\nCalling it a personal video recorder may make it sound complicated, but what a Tivo does is pretty easy to understand: it records the programs you want to watch when they're on, whether you're there or not.\nThe menu system that Tivo uses is much, much easier to understand than the typical VCR and - while it takes a little getting used to - installing and using a Tivo is simple, too.\nUnlike a VCR, you won't have new shows to watch right away, but hang in there. In a week or so, you'll have so many to watch you won't have enough time to see them all!

I don't anticipate using the VCR for anything else for the forseeable future. I've read a great deal about how Tivo will change your viewing habits and this is entirely true. Two very small recommendations (I should note that these may already be available. I haven't had much need to read the manual, so I haven't searched these out too well): 1. It would be helpful for the system to tell you how much recording time you have left. i have a 30-hour unit which ought to be plenty, but 2. the default for recording is ""best"" quality, which uses a great deal more space than ""normal"", which works fine for me. Perhaps the default can be set for ""normal"" to maximize the available time.  Again, these are very minor considerations.";So far --- GREAT!
18;55.0;5.0;13.0;-605.4267142857142;"I hesitated before buying a TiVo, because I wasn't sure if it was the best option for me. Now I can't believe that I ever lived without it! I've only had it for a month, but now whenever I watch TV somewhere without TiVo, I get so frustrated because I can't pause, rewind, have an instant replay, etc. I can't imagine living without the TiVo-- I hardly ever use my VCR anymore.\nSetting up the TiVo is not as easy as they make it out to be -- if you have cable box you may have to spend countless hours fiddling around behind your TV before you can get the TiVo to work, because it's meant to work with either Direct TV or a Satellite. Nevertheless, it DOES work with almost ALL TVs and set-ups, and after you first get it all set up, it's effortless to use. The interactive menu is intuitive and easy-to-use, so you'll be setting up Season Passes to record your favorite shows as soon as you start. You can search for shows to record by Time, Channel, Name or Genre, and you can get a ""Season Pass"" in order to record the show whenever it's on.\nI love always having a selection of shows I like ready for me to watch, instead of having to channel surf endlessly to find something. Though there may not be a full 30 hours of recording time on the TiVo (30 hours is only with ""Basic"" sub-par Quality picture-- and Best Quality you can only record 9 hours), I still find that I always have extra room left over to record my favorite shows. I've actually found that I don't watch MORE TV now that I have the TiVo, I just watch TV shows that I actually like, at times when I am available. I get more homework done now (no joke). If there is extra room available, the TiVo actually records TV Shows that it ""thinks"" that you would like, since you are able to rate TV Shows and Movies, it can choose similar ones that you might enjoy. For example, if you give ""Friends"" 3 thumbs up, it may record ""Seinfeld"" for you if you have extra room. If you don't want the shows it it records, you can simply delete them or give them a ""Thumbs Down"" rating. The more shows you rate, the better TiVo understands your personal tastes. The only thing I wish it could do is record on one channel while I watch another, but it is understandable that it cannot. Also, TiVo comes up with ""updates"" now and again to improve on its features, so if something isn't perfect now, it may be improved in the future. For example, some reviewers complained that while recording sports, TiVo would fail to record if the game went into overtime, but now TiVo has a feature which lets you ""cushion"" your recordings by however much time you want, to ensure that you don't miss anything.\nOne of the best features by far is a the ""Live TV Guide"" -- if you just press the ""Live TV Guide"" button while watching TV, a menu pops up on top of the screen giving the name of the show or movie, a brief plot summary, who the actors are, when it started, when it ends and what's on after it. Watching TV was never so easy. Whenever I show my friends how TiVo works, they are amazed by how we can pause, go get a drink or go to the bathroom, then come back and fast forward through all the commercials. You'll also never have to say ""Wait! What happened?? I missed it!"" because you can simply rewind backwards in the program and watch it again.\nI know that I am gushing about this, but TiVo seriosly has changed the way I watch TV-- as many other reviewers have said, TiVo lets YOU control your TV, not the other way around. I think that I'll be using it for a long, long time from now, and I have no regrets about buying it.";Say Goodbye to your VCR...

I initially experienced reduced video quality upon initial hookup, but then added a monster video cable and video quality was restored. No loss of quality when I used the medium quality setting.  Unfortunately, the modem shorted after 9 months.  Sears refused to fix it, even though I took their extended warranty.  They refunded my full purchase price.  But-Warning, take the monthly TIVO service, and an extended warranty.  I paid for the lifetime product subscription, and the product only lasted 9 months.;TIVO HDR 312

I bought the TIVO lifetime membership...and it is the best investment I have made in the home entertainment area.  I had problems with the Phillips TIVO player about 7 months after I bought it; it just completely crashed.  Unfortunately, the way Phillips structures the warranty, after 6 months you can get free parts, but have to pay for the ""labor"" of shipping you a replacement.\nIt took a lot of time to get the replacement.  I had multiple (>10) interactions with customer service and ran into the same headaches time and again, until I found one good representative. Long story short, I got my replacement.  Additionally, I wrote a complaint letter to Phillips and had my...labor fee refunded which was great, so I won't knock them too hard on the customer service.\nMy new recorder has been working great.  I am very busy during the week, without the opportunity to watch much TV, and there is nothing better than having all of my favorite shows on tap every Friday night.\nOne note about the rated hours...this model does not have a 30 hour capacity if you record on ""best quality"" (which, trust me you will want to do), it is more like 10.  And 10 hours goes quickly, because your shows tend to pile up until you can really sit down for a nice, long, TV marathon.  And that's what its all about, isn't it.";TIVO is Great, Phillips takes more patience

Initial setup took me about  an hour, and the system worked perfectly ever since. Picture quality is  great. It is almost SuperVHS-like when my TV reception is at its best on  best quality (which gives you 10 hours on ""30 hour"" unit). Guess  what -- I never ran out of space. I even have a small archive of Futurama  cartoons that I have not moved to a VCR (yes, you can do that).\nI see  lockups mentioned in previous reviews. My unit locked up once during setup.  All you need to do is reboot TIVO by unplugging the box. I've had no other  problems whatsoever.\nAs a result I do not watch live TV any more and  never miss any shows that I like. While watching TIVO I zoom through  commercial I do not like, but I repeat the ones that I do like (I think  that I watched Palm commercial with a girl beaming her phone number to a  dude a few dozens of times :).\nFast forwarding is awesome!

Then if you do some research people, people who have done this had to wait a month the got a refurbished product that soon did the same thing.  I think the company has some serious explaining to do.  It is not a hard drive failure, it is a product that they will not stand behind because they know that they have people in a LIFETIME service agreement.

67;63.0;5.0;14.0;-212.8685099337748;Wow!  I've had my Philips TiVo unit since December (my Christmas present to myself) and I have been quite impressed with it and think this is the greatest entertainment device since DirecTV.\nI have the 30 hour unit  which gives me a lot of room of programming.  I generally record movies  under the Best Quality setting and other programming under the other  settings.\nThe other features I like are the Season Pass, the ability to  pause live television and video quality and sound.  The Season Pass feature  enables me to never ever have to worry about having a tape in the vcr to  tape programming or setting the timer  In my life, I don't have the time to  spend worrying about videotape.\nBeing a movie buff and a sports nut,  the pause button comes in handy frequently when watching live television.  One thing that I've done while watching sports is rewinding back to catch  some of the action, thus avoiding commericals.\nAnd finally the  video/sound quality is outstanding.  I have my TiVo hooked up to my home  theatre system and the sound quality is not altered.\nThe drawbacks of the  TiVo unit are trivial in my eyes, but I will point them out for the benefit  of others who have DirecTV.  If you have a DirecTV system or other DSS, you  will find that it will take quite some time for the unit to index the  channels/programs when initially setting it up.  Patience is necessary.  Second, do not ever turn off your DSS receiver.  This will cause the TiVo  unit to freeze the next time you attempt to use it.\nI have no regrets  with my decision to purchase the Philips TiVo unit and highly recommend it.  You can finally control television instead of it controlling you.;Welcome to the Tivolution!
13;64.0;5.0;11.0;-225.89884615384608;I've had my 30 hour Tivo unit for a couple of weeks now and I am really enjoying it. Its easy to use, and was fairly easy to set up with my cable box and Philips Magnavox TV.\nWith TiVO unit,your no longer at the mercy of whatever happens to be on TV when you actually have some free time to watch something. There's actually alot of cool stuff on TV, it's just that most of it is at inconvenient times. (work,sleep etc)\nThe Philips Tivo unit is very easy to drive, yet is very powerful in what it allows you to do. The TVguide listings are very handy to see whats on at a glance, and the searching options to find things to records are very flexible. The TiVo magazine recommendations are also very handy, highlighting things I might not have thought to record. The tIVo recommendations generated from you viewing habits are also sometimes interesting, and worth looking at once in a while to try out something new.\nThe automatic updates to the software is an excellent feature, with the latest version of the software being an excellent revision...with the Season Pass manager being an excellent enhancement to an already great system.\nThanks for making such a cool TiVO unit at an excellent price Philips...and hats of to the creators of the TiVo service, a truly excellent idea.\nThe only thing I would say that 30Hours really isn't 30Hours unles your recording on the worst quality. On medium quality which is totally cool, you get about 21hours on a 30hour unit.\nIf you don't own a TiVO unit and have cable TV access, your just not getting value for money out of your cable connection, do yourself a huge favour and by a TiVO unit. You won't regret it.\nCheers,;Changes TV into something refreshing!
64;65.0;5.0;13.0;-77.97534759358285;"Yes, I agree with the others, this product is indeed a must-have. And to use that well-worn phrase, it really WILL change the way you watch TV. I'm totally thrilled with mine. I bought the 30 hour model and just love it!  The set up -can- be tricky, but not really, because the manual guides you  through the process completely. The guide is extremely well thought out and  presented in a clear fashion. Plus, they've included lots of accessory  hardware (cables, etc.) to get you going. I have a digital broadband signal  coming into my house, so even at the BASIC quality (30 hrs), the recordings  I get are clearer than SP on my VCR. Really. I love pausing live TV and the  best thing is having something ready to watch whenever I want. Tivo's  suggestions are really good; I've only had to thumbs-down a couple of  things. This product is GOING to catch on. You have to try it for yourself  to believe it. It's WELL worth the money. Now there's something on I like  all the time. Get it!";Something you really NEED!
98;66.0;5.0;7.0;-17.069285714285684;My wife gave me Tivo last Christmas. It is the greatest single item I think I have ever owned. Its like having your own network. It has lived up to each and every claim the company has made and them some. I think the only live tv I watch now is the news, and sometimes I pause it so I can zip through the commercials. Tivo records all my favorite shows and movies, etc. and they are always recorded for me to watch when I want, not when there on. With cable I am able to get such a variety of my favorites I cannot keep up with them. This sure is better then a VCR. If you don't have Tivo, I say buy it!;I love my Tivo!!!!!

I set my TIVO up to give me a season pass to the  program.  When I come home after work there are always at least 2 episodes  recorded for me to watch.  The only problem that I have is that sometimes  the audio does not match the video.  It's sort of like watching an old  Godzilla movie.

33;68.0;5.0;11.0;-258.0485911602209;"I received a great birthday present in 2000; the TiVo.  I can honestly say it's changed the way I view television (however corny their ad slogan is).\nI set up my TiVo in late September, and I haven't looked back since.  The setup took an extraordinary amount of time (at least 2 hours), but once I got rolling, everything else was pretty easy.  I can't tell you how much I enjoy taking my time to do things instead of rushing home to catch my favorite program.  I don't have to worry, because TiVo's got me covered.\nNot only has the TiVo recorded programs I like to watch, but it recommends show that I might watch (though the use of the Thumbs Up-Thumbs Down recommendations I give to specific shows), and I can say that some of the recommendations they've given have hit the nail right on the head.  The recommendations can be a little weird though.  I mean, I'm a guy who likes The Simpsons, but does that mean I'll like Rugrats as well?\nThis is not a perfect unit, though.  Drawbacks include missing recording cues (although not entirely TiVo's fault, but you'd think some networks would get on the ball here and standardize when they start and stop a show).  You wouldn't know how many times I've said ""Oh, the recording started late again,"" or ""Why did you cut off the ending?!?!?"" Also the unit, in a quiet room, can be a little noisy.  When I'm watching a show late at night, I can hear the unit's hard drive churning.  Maybe I'm nitpicking, but I thought you would like to know.\nAnother drawback is the inability to totally skip over commercials.  You can fast forward, sure.  You have to be good at timing the fast forward right so that when you hit play, you'll catch the show just after commercial.\nYes, the product has drawbacks, but I can look past that for now and say that this product is amazing.

11;69.0;1.0;9.0;-54.728333333333296;I absolutely loved my Tivo, it was great until the modem stopped working.  Needless to say, I spent a loooong time on the phone with customer service.  I found out then that after I gave them $99 and paid for the shipping they could fix it, so I thought.  It came back yesterday, I hooked it up and sure enough, the modem works.  Now, I have a new problem.  It freezes up during the set up procedure.  I haven't called customer service yet.  If you really want one of these, I would recomend that you pay for the Tivo service on monthly basis for a year or so until your reasonably sure it won't die, or don't pay for it at all and use your recorder like a regular VCR by manually setting the time and date of shows.  Most of all, read the negative reviews, for some reason, I didn't and now I'm paying for it.;It's great (when it's not at the repair shop)

And when I wanted to switch, it took a 2 hour set up.  Also, if your system requires a cable box you probably won't be able to  watch another channel while Tivo is recording. (you would need another  cable box or cable tuner of some sort)";Beware!!
27;71.0;5.0;10.0;-917.8208011869435;"I've had a TiVo for over a year now.  I don't know how I'd watch TV without it.  Let me address some items from an earlier review:\nAnd now for the drawbacks of tivo (which far surpasses the good things).\n1. Unless you have a newer tv with 2 video inputs, you can't record one show, while viewing another.\nTrue. But even my older TV has 2 inputs.\n2. You can only rewind live tv back to the point where you changed the channel. This means that if you change the channel to Leno and just barely miss the punchline... too bad, you can't rewind.\nWell if you started recording anything after it started how could you go back to before then?  TiVo would need to be recording every channel you received at the same time to do what you are complaining about here.\n3. You can only pause for a max of 30 mins.\nTrue.  If you are going to pause for longer just hit RECORD.\n4. You can only rewind to a max of 30 mins, UNLESS the show is being recorded, in which case you can rewind all the way to the beginning of the recording.\nTrue the live buffer is 30 min.  If you hit RECORD the new software will record back to the beginning of the live buffer so you're covered.\n5. If you are watching tv behind real time and want to change the channel for a few minutes, when you come back to the show you were watching, it'll resume at real time and you can't rewind, so you'll have missed however much time you were behind.\nTrue, again TiVo can only record one thing at a time.  How would it know you wanted to come back?  You did change channels right?\n6. The ""Season Pass"" function is supposed to record the selected show no matter what time it plays and no matter what channel. I got a season pass for Spin City, but I had to set 2 Season Passes... one for channel 13 and the other for channel 7 in order for it to work correctly.\nThe Seasons Pass needs to be setup for each channel.  This is a feature so you can get the programs from the source you want.\n7. The Thumbs up/down system doesn't work very well. For some reason I end up with more Fresh Prince of Bel Air (3 thumbs up) than Spin City (which I have a season pass for). Also, my tivo likes to record practically every movie on Sundance even though I give every single one of those movies 3 thumbs down.\nSuggestions (thumbs up/down) take awhile for TiVo to learn.  Give it some time and it works great.  Also over use of thumbs down will really hose you up.\n8. Since the tivo box is ALWAYS on, there's no way for it to tell if you're actually there watching tv. So in the middle of a show a message will pop up asking to change the channel so that it can record a ""tivo suggestion."" Sometimes this is a hassle to find the remote and select ""cancel recording and stay on this channel."" Also, if you're listening to the tv, but not actually watching it, you may miss the pop up message, in which case it will automatically change the channel and start recording. This means, that you have to cancel the recording, and then switch back to the channel you were on, therefore missing part of the show you were listening to.\nHow else is it supposed to know if it can change channels?  I think this was very well implemented.  Would you rather tell it to record like a VCR?  You can do that if you like by using the manual recording method.\n9. Sometimes you'll be watching a show (which is not being recorded) and something really spectacular or funny will happen. You would think that you could rewind and then hit record, so that you could show it to somebody later. But when you hit record, it'll start recording from live tv to the end of the show. This is also the same problem if you have live tv paused. Let's say the phone rings, so you pause the show you're watching. You realize that you're going to be on the phone for longer than 30 mins, so you hit record. When you go back to watch the show, you'll find that it didn't record from the point it was paused at, but rather the point of live tv when you hit record.\nThis has been changed with the new software.  It will record from the beginning of the buffer forward.\n10. Shows are recorded based on the tivo programming guide which is downloaded over your phone line. This means that many times you will miss the intro or last joke of a recorded show. Or if a game goes into overtime, yep, that's right you miss the whole overtime. Of course you can always record manually by setting a time period, but that's kind of a hassle.\nMissing of intros or program ends is NOT TiVo's fault.  The networks are starting early or ending late to get people into the next program.  Complain to the networks about this. As to a game how would TiVo know a game was going into overtime?  If you know this in advance you are an amazing person!\nAlso, the DirecTv Tivo's (a DirecTv reciever with TiVo built in) have dual tuners.  At present only one of them is active but a software upgrade that is due out this summer will allow you to watch one program while recording another.  Or better yet, record two programs at the same time!\nYou have nothing to lose TiVo has a 30 day money back guarentee.  So give it a try.  You'll not know how you lived without it.";TiVo best thing since sliced bread!

For example, before I bought the TIVO I had 6 VCRs in the house. Today they are rarely used. The best  HiFi VCR is nice, but pales in comparison to TIVO.\nTIVO is like having  multiple VCRs in one room because it allows me record one program while  watching another. But it's better than that. No tapes to worry about. No  timers to set. No forgetting to program your VCR for favorite shows. No  more being disappointed to find that your favorite show was on a different  night or time this week.

Despite the fact that the unit failed in approx 2 weeks, Philips/Tivo per their stated  policy made me ship them the failled unit at my expense!  They generously  allowed that if I shipped it by UPS Next Day Air (60+ dollars) they would  send me the replacement by the same means.  They claim that they will ship  within two working days of receiving the faulty unit and they did so in my  case.\nSomething I've learned that isn't immediately obvious: Tivo  basically provides and updates the programming/operating software while  Philips and Sony manufacture units that use this programming. My experience  is with the Philips unit and I have no knowlege of the Sony unit(s).\nIt  looks as if Philips has some QA problems and for them to charge for the  cost of returning units that fail within the warranty period shows brass  one's beyond belief.\nPS: For those that acclaim Panasonic for not  charging for their programming service, note that the price of the Philips  box + lifetime programming costs the same as the Panasonic box with  ""free"" programming.\nWithout regard to the apparent QA problem  with the Philips hardware, the Tivo/Philips combination rates 4.5 stars. If  one's unit fails and has to be returned at one's own expense and hassle it  is hard to think in terms of stars.\nThese people richly deserve the fall  off in sales they will no doubt experience.

No commercials *ever* and moving around in a  recording is easy and instant. Picture quality is excellent and the  software is smart (though it could be smarter).

It allows me to watch news programs and zip through commercials and self-serving spin by reactionary political hacks.  The controls are beautifully designed and frequent improvements are automatically downloaded to the device. The process for requesting a recording is laughably quick and easy.  I had to tinker with it a bit when I set it up, mainly because I did not bother to read the directions, but the telephone support was helpful and cheerful.\nAnother reviewer found that he could not watch live TV and use Tivo simultaneously - must have operated it incorrectly - live TV is always available during recording.  Also, the telephone connection does not intrude at all - incoming or outgoing calls will inconspicuously go through, should they occur while Tivo is downloading the schedule.\nWhile adults who hate being limited to a broadcast/cable TV schedule would love this thing, I think it is even better for children.  Having a nice menu of hig quality kid recordings on hand lets parents control content and timing of TV watching.  It would be particulaly helpful for parents whose children are devoted to programs which may be timed to interfere with homework or meals.  As an educator, I am concerned by the tyranny TV exerts over children at an age when they lack the maturity to turn off a program and let it go.  If a story will be remain available for a while, the need to watch it it may not seem as compelling later on. (Works for grown-ups too.);Revolutionary machine

Now you can watch AND record TiVo shows at the same time. If you miss the beginning/end - it doesn't matter - you can slew to whatever point in the recorded program. Sounds inconsequential, but it isn't when you've missed the beginning of the nightly news, that all so important soap opera, or whatever your fancy. One of the best features is the fast forward/rewind 3-speed scan - once you hit play, it plays back at the last visual pause/transition, starting you at your program.\nThe unit starts 'learning' your TV preferences by content; there's also a personal voting scale so the unit can start learning and recording on downtimes.

Also, there a 'season pass' that essentially records the specified show whenever it appears in the tv lineup; this is a problem if you'd like to override just one of the shows for an alternate specific show. You'll just have to revert back to manual setting of time/date recording. Oh, the setting of time/day recording like VCRs is over, you can search and select by show name, search by type of subject matter (drama, news, etc).\nThe term 'product' is misleading - this machine is a computer with one/two hardrives, a modem that allows for updates, all the current input options (satellite, S-video, RCA) and comes with all the cables you'll need and more. The all-knowing eye semantics on the front facia is a bit ominous, but true to its function.\n(...) Get a unit with one harddrive if you've got the choice...research a bit and you'll see why if you're a hacker. The folks who designed and put all this together should get some sort of couch-potato award.";A must purchase for max couch-potato efficiency!
61;79.0;5.0;10.0;28.855000000000018;Wow.... So many wonderful things to say about TIVO. I've owned mine for 6 months and it will change the way you watch TV. No more being tied to a TV schedule. Watch your shows when you want plus you get back 3 min. of your  time eveytime their is a commercial break and that adds up to hours of your  life. Leave off the fluff and watch only the good stuff you want to  view.\nFor a new product just out of the gate, this one is 5 Stars Plus.;TIVO Rules
82;80.0;5.0;10.0;48.053684210526335;I've owned my Tivo for a month now and couldn't imagine not having it!  I've completely stopped using my VCRs to record TV.  In the past month, I've change my cable service over to digital and reconfiguring the Tivo  system was a snap.  This is the best electronics purchase I've ever made...;No Regrets!
93;81.0;5.0;10.0;-8.062857142857112;I bought the 30 hour TiVo, in fact two of them.  This is absolutely the greatest product made for use with the television.  I no longer miss my favorite shows, no matter when they come on and now that my TiVo has  learned what shows I like, it suggests shows that it thinks I may like.  This is great since I am now watching shows that I never knew existed.  The  intergrated TV Listing that shows both the DSS and cable listings makes it  easy to find whats on.  Also it eliminates any manual input switching.  Well, thats is.  It's a great product and you will have one, now or later!;TiVo - It will change the way you watch TV forever.
23;82.0;5.0;8.0;-371.47761194029846;I knew from the moment I heard of the concept of Tivo and Replay, I wanted one..but I had to wait until the price came down and the recording space went up. I bought a 30 hour Phillips Tivo last August and I absolutely love it. The subscription was a concern to me but if you buy the lifetime subscription, it costs no more than a Replay which has the subscription fee built in the selling price and if you decide to sell your Tivo with a lifetime subscription, you would most likely recoup a most of that subscription fee. Yes, setup takes some time but not your time. After a few minutes of making your choices during the setup, it takes awhile to download your programming and get it setup but you can go to dinner or sleep while that happens. The modem is a weak point which can be solved by unplugging the phone line during violent storms and using a phone line surge protector. The 1.3 version software was a little slow compared to the 2.01 I have now. The 2.01 version has made the unit more more responsive. It is absolutely wonderful to watch shows at your own convenience. Tivo finds shows I have enjoyed which I never would have found on my own. I love seeing what Tivo has figured out I would like to watch. I have my Tivo programmed to go through the VCR so if I do want to watch something other than what I am recording, all I have to do is turn the VCR off and watch TV regularly. (Even though it is hard to do without the ability to pause or speed through commercials).I love pausing. I love recording something while watching something else I have already recorded. I love whizzing through commercials. I love backing up Tivo to hear what someone on TV said that I didn't quite catch. I love the hard drive recording and menus ..no comparison to a VCR. I love setting up season passes with priorities set and having the TV change channels all by itself for the week. Really could make one into a real couch potato. Finally I love my Phillips remote. It is the most intuitive ergonomic remote control I have ever known. I figured out what buttons to push in the dark the first night. Just feels good in the hand. I have to have a stand alone model for I have to watch OTA channels since network channels are not available on my DirecTV receiver in southern Missouri. I am sure I will get a 60 hour SA model when the price drops some more so I can Tivo two channels at the same time. I definitely am a member of Tivolution.;Can't go back to regular TV after you have enjoyed it!
4;83.0;4.0;6.0;3.0623853211009333;My first experience with this kind of recorder was the built-in one with my Dish player.  I was hooked.  I moved and couldn't have dish here so went to look at TIVO and REPLAY.  Ultimately, the best system would be a combonation of the best of both, but alas . . .  My best friend has Replay and there are some great things -- but TIVO, by and far, is much better for me.  I realize many smart people will see it different.\nThe Season Pass, Wishlists are just better.  Plus, I DO NOT advise buying the Sony unit -- the remote is STUPID -- Philips rocks -- and it's European and NOT Japanese!;Rocks over Replay
34;84.0;5.0;8.0;-158.88996062992123;"I bought a TIVO 12 months ago, with some hesitation.  But after a full year of ownership, I recommend it with  great enthusiam. This is an absolutely wonderful product. It has totally transformed my TV watching experience.  I now really never watch live TV, but rather the TIVO only.  If I am in the mood to watch TV, I just hit the ""What's Showing"" selection and have a choice of 4 or 5 movies that I requested to be recorded (and have since forgotten I requested them); and perhaps one or two NOVA's, an episode or two of Seinfeld, maybe a ""Great Performance"", maybe a West Wing, etc. etc. etc.  Because you can instruct it to record every showing of favorite programs, these shows are ""now showing"" regularly, and without any effort (or recall) on my part. (Even if they are on only occasionally, e.g. Great Performances on PBS). In short, there are always several program selections you personally can enjoy, now, on TV. Always. (And you can skip all the commercials.) Anp pause the show when the phone rimgs.  Or dump it to tape for permanent storage, if you care to.  Moreover, I have had zero technical problems.  Once set up, it is very simple to use.  Even if you don't watch TV much, get one of these things.  There's some great stuff on TV, once you weed out the garbage (documentaries, news shows, science shows, movies, history, concerts, what do you like?) This thing does the weeding.";Terrific Product
89;85.0;5.0;9.0;37.99000000000002;I've had TIVO now for 2 months and I couldn't be happier with it!  It truly is a personal television receiver.\nI watch what I want, when I want!  It's that simple.  I have to admit that I am a soap junkie, as well  as a movie buff.\nUsed to be tough getting everything set up on my VCR,  but not anymore!\nTivo is great!  You too should join the TIVOLUTION!  I  promise - you'll never go back!\n-Christy, MCSE;Tivo ROCKS!

58;87.0;5.0;8.0;33.48125000000002;After you get this gizmo, you'll never use a VCR again for recording stuff on TV. The super-fast forward alone is worth the dough. Incredibly, it records shows I usually watch but forget to set it for. The quality is  better than any VCR I ever had, and the ability to start watching from the  beginning while the recording is underway is great.;Super Machine
25;88.0;5.0;7.0;-396.59727272727264;I think some of the folks writing reviews of this product do not completely understand it.  Sure, it's nice to be able to pause live TV, but that's not what I love the most about Tivo.\nI used to tape a lot of shows on my VCR.  My wife was always complaining because I never got around to labeling the tapes, and looking for a show I wanted to see would take a while.  Once I found the tape, I'd have to search it to find the show.  I had tapes piling up alongside the deck.  It was a mess.\nNow that I have Tivo, watching TV is more fun than ever.  All the shows I want to watch are right there, labeled and dated.  The picture quality, even at medium, simply blows away VHS.  I watch whatever I want whenever I want to.\nThe user interface is magnificent.  You can pad start times and end times (I always start ER a minute early!).  I have wishlists, with which I can have Tivo look for an actor, director, or keyword, and then it will tape the show automatically.  And it has an amazing feature that lets me rate any show I see with thumbs up or thumbs down (up to 3 of either), and it learns from my ratings what I like to watch and what I don't like to watch.  With Suggestions enabled (you can turn them off if you don't want them, but this is a great feature!), Tivo will seek out and record shows it thinks you might like.\nAs a result of having Tivo, I get so much more out of my television experience than I ever did before.  It's like there's always something great on that I want to see.  I hardly ever watch live TV any more.\nI saw a review here where the reviewer was concentrating on Tivo's limitations.  Sure it has some limitations (and by the way, that reviewer was off the mark on several things he wrote.  For example, you can pad start and end times if you expect a show to run overtime.  And while it doesn't have a 30 second skip, it has a wonderful fast play forward and reverse that makes it a breeze to zip through commercials!), but as far as I'm concerned it offers so much more than a VCR that it defies comparison.  My wife was never comfortable with our VCR.  She couldn't program it and had trouble finding recorded shows.  She loves our Tivo and operates it easily.\nVery few products these days can claim to be life changing.  Tivo has completely changed the way we watch television, and we can't imagine life without it.  It's been a solid and reliable piece of equipment as well.  If you do a lot of taping, or if you just like to watch television, I heartily recommend this item.;Tivo changed my life!
9;89.0;5.0;6.0;15.930515463917558;Great product that makes the VCR a thing of the past.  Once you have one you'll never be able to live without it.  Best feature is the simple PAUSE.  With five-month old twins being able to PAUSE the TV and deal with baby issues is very nice.  The recording of shows is very simple, no setting time as a VCR does, but instead select the show by name and the TiVo will record the show even if the show moves to another time slot.  Had mine for almost a year now and have had no troubles.;Love It.  Makes TV better.
32;90.0;5.0;7.0;-80.6235714285714;"Very handy useful device that has made me a coach potato! This will truly change the way you watch TV for good. I was very please the moment I opened the box. Everything in the box is nicely organized and all the cables you could possibly need are included, which made the setup quick and easy (still had to wait for the software download - about 2 hours). Give this thing a week to learn what you like and program all your favorite shows and you too will be hooked. The only downside I can think of is you can't record two shows at the same time. Plus, the image quality will take a hit when viewing ""live"" and recorded TV.  Since the TiVo is viewed through your TVs composite A/V input you could switch b/w regular cable and TiVo TV if there is a recording conflict or you want to see a better image from time to time. But these are very minor flaws, which will improve as technology improves.  For now, I am very pleased and much fatter :)";Nice toy, which can only get better.
51;91.0;5.0;7.0;5.698571428571441;I've bought two of these in the last 4 months, and am an avid enthusiasts of the TiVo. I can't say anymore than what has already been said, except that the service is great, and the product is revolutionary. Recently I was  thinking that this is the most notable technology to come to a medium since  Macs changed the computer industry. You really do have to try one for  yourself, and when you do, you won't be able to imagine how you ever lived  your life without one.;The best consumer electronics product in recent memory.
20;92.0;4.0;6.0;-78.3343195266272;The TiVo is an incredibly addicitive invention.  Once you have one, you won't be able to live without it.  The ability to pause and rewind live tv shows, and a program guide that lets you record every episode of a partiular TV show, ensures that you will never miss anything on TV again.  However, be warned before you pick up one of these gems.  If you have or plan to get Directv, get a TiVo w/ integrated Directv or an UltimateTV system.  Additionally, if you have a cable box, you might have problems getting the TiVo to work with the box.  The TiVo needs to have full control over changing the channels in order to use all of its features.  Additionally, you will need to pay a monthly fee to activate TiVo service.  Despite these problems, you will find yourself willing to work a few extra hours a month to pay for the (...) monthly fee -- after all, you won't miss your favorite shows with TiVo at home.;Can't Live Without It Despite Flaws
39;93.0;5.0;6.0;-74.88499999999998;I found Tivo to be everything I had hoped for. I have cable and Dish  Network and the picture is perfect as far as I can see. It takes about 4  hrs todo the complete setup. But it is well worth it. It has changed the  way I watch tv. I now only watch what I have told Tivo to record. I hardly  ever watch live tv. The tech support you get if you have any problems is  great. The feature I like the best are the season pass which is when you  tell Tivo to record a show anytime it is showing. I also like the pause  button when I do watch live tv. I find Tivo to be the best video toy I have  bought to date. I bought the 30 hr Tivo. I will never be able to watch  everything that it records. I do not surf the channels anymore and I never  have to watch any commicials anymore. It has a lot of additional features  but I would typing here forever.

We work a lot,  and thus being able to pick exactly what programming we want to watch and  when is pretty great.\nIn 15 years of VCR ownership, I was rarely able to  record a show correctly, I've never messed it up with Tivo, press one  button and it does the rest, automatically, week after week, its that  easy!!!;This is the best product I've ever bought !!!!
44;95.0;5.0;6.0;-42.724999999999994;You'll never regret buying this!  It's easy to use (my wife and kids had  no trouble from the first day).  It records shows you want to watch in MUCH  better than VCR quality with no need to fumble for tapes or worry about  switching cable box channels.  With a few clicks, Tivo will automatically  record ever episode of shows like Survivor, the Sopranos or The West Wing  without you needing to do anything else.  You watch what you want whenever  you want to watch it.  Tivo lets you pause live TV while the phone rings  and pick up where you left off.  It lets you rewind to see a great play  during a ball game, and then catch up during commercials.  The remote is  the best designed remote I've ever owned.\nTivo is GREAT!!

26;98.0;5.0;5.0;-264.3340166204986;"If you want to save significant time watching TV and want to watch a variety of higher-quality shows when YOU want to, this is the product to get.\nThe ""pause"" feature is very handy, but the big seller is the Season Pass (below).  If you have to put your child in bed, you don't have to miss a part of your show -- just hit Pause and then Play when you come back.  Same for the telephone or when Mother Nature calls.  This is a great stress reducer!\nSeason Passes are even better.  No more fussing with tapes and figuring out which has what show on it (not to mention that it would take 10+ tapes to do what we do with TiVo).  For example, we set a Season Pass for ""The West Wing"" just once, and now it will record every show that comes up (you also can choose only new shows instead of reruns).  It will keep track of time changes and day changes.  When you come home, you look at Now Playing and it shows you what shows are available.  Ours has things like ""The West Wing"", ""ER"", ""Boston Public"", ""David Letterman"" and ""Whose Line Is It Anyway"".  Who cares when they were shown live, we can watch when WE want to.\nMy wife watches soap operas again.  With tapes, she got tired of putting in new tapes, accidentally recording over shows, forgetting to rewind before recording, etc.  All of that is history.  Now the shows come up in the list and she can hit Play or Delete (if she has several days worth, she is more inclined to hit Delete).  While viewing, she can skip through sections at 3x, 20x or 60x.  She typically watches 90 minutes in 15 minutes or less (she only cares about one or two story lines in a show).\nIt will almost certainly change your viewing habits -- for the better.  You may watch shows, again, that you used to watch.  You are not required to watch crappy shows because that is the only thing on at the moment.  More shows, higher quality, less time.  That is what makes a great consumer product.";Awesome!  Save Time And Get Better Viewing!

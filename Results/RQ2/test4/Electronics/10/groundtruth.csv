3;1.0;3.0;6.0;-15.616428571428557;For the price I expect a better product. The trip maker in the tablet don't have campground or rv spots. While working trip maker on the tablet is stops working ALL the time, no exception. Working trip maker online on a PC works better but even thou it has a print ikon it is not active. Program show lat and long but you cannot input in trip maker. The tablet is not powerful enough to process trip maker that is disappointing. GPS function works great, poi including camps and rv spots shows but have preference on private business. Overall this item is overpriced. The value is only in the GPS functions.;For the price I expect a better product. The trip maker in the tablet don't ...
2;2.0;5.0;36.0;-136.7725311203319;Having owned the first RVND 7710, which was a love/hate relationship, I upgraded to the RVND 7720. Everything I hated had been fixed so that thing was great, worked like a charm and got me all over the place for four years. Upon seeing this tablet I knew I would eventually have to have one. I'm really big on reading the product reviews and this thing was so new that there were none. Well, I took a chance and haven't regretted it a bit. What a difference the 8 inch  screen makes. And the contrast is so good that I can sit it up in the middle of the dashboard so that my wife can see what's going on as well. It takes a while to setup the highly customizable features but only because there are so many ways to do it. The magnetic mount once the windshield mount is setup is nice. Popping it on and off is a breeze. If there is any room for complaint at all it's the audio guality. At lower volumes it's ok, but when in busy traffic and the volume needs to be louder the audio becomes almost unreadable. Sorta like a really cheap stereo! They could have done better but all in all this unit is fantastic. Oh, one more thing. Had they made it Bluetooth compatible it would be beyond fantastic. Maybe on the next one!;Fantastic GPS
4;3.0;2.0;8.0;-50.00805369127514;Warning, the magnet clip allows the unit to fall off. I upgraded to this  unit because I thought it was better  then  older RVND 7720. This unit allows you to trip plan on the screen instead of a computer,  that is a plus.  Biggest problem is the magnetic mounting system. It is easily knocked off with the slightest jar.  This happened several times allowing  the display to fall, and in my case, breaking the screen. This happened on the first trip out. The unit was mounted in the same place as the older unit. We never had the problem with the older unit that clipped in.  We are now using  it for our travels. I think Rand McNally is going to have to re-design the mounting system. For the money I would not recommend buying this unit IF your have another option or a new mounting system comes out.;1 trip and its broken
6;4.0;5.0;14.0;40.34044776119404;"The unit did not work as advertised out of the box. There were no points of interest, it routed me onto passenger vehicles only roads and 9' bridge when it was in RV mode 12'8"" and 34' 5th wheel. When I called Rand they gave me a code and I had to redownload the operating system. After that it has worked great and would recommend it.";After that it has worked great and would recommend it
5;5.0;5.0;5.0;-97.39512195121948;"Great GPS.. You can add the dimensions of your RV and it will take you to big enough roads. The only thing I didn't like is that it didn't know about a freeway closeup, (we knew about it since it's closed for a while now due to repairs)... It kept telling us to use it and only when we were passed it, it showed us the new way.. It kept ""recalculating  the route though which I liked.. It is very nice to look at it and know what the speed limit is and what your speed is at any given point.. very clear to see even if it's on the the co-pilots side.. I tried using my sunglasses and all of the sudden it went dark.. I couldn't see anything on it.. I asked my wife if something happened to it and she said ""no it's working fine"".. I took my sunglasses off and sure enough it was working fine.. I am guessing the polarized lenses won't allow you to see it?? My sunglasses are Maui Jim and they are polarized.. I don't know enough about sunglasses to guess something else.. Overall a great GPS for RVers.";It's a good one.
7;6.0;5.0;11.0;-15.58135135135133;Great RV GPS. Mostly keeps you out of trouble with bridges. Keeps you informed on your next move so you know you need to move over a lane just after you exit. When you ask for a campground along your route it gives only the ones in front of you and all so far have been within a few miles of exit. Before this i used Garmin and they just had arrows pointing in all directions and you never knew how far off the highway they were. You also get general information on the campground including contact information. This is the only GPS brand i will ever own in the future.;Never look back to other brands i have owned
1;7.0;1.0;17.0;-98.68384615384612;Received this as a gift and have found the help line to be helpless. The Android OS - KitKat (Android 4.4.2)  is more than 3 years old it's not even the latest version of KitKat. Android 4.4.4 was released June 19th 2014 and its primary purpose was to eliminate an OpenSSL man-in-the-middle vulnerability.  Therefore, the  tablet is susceptible to this  security vulnerability. Google Play Store App not installed on the Rand McNally tablets. Instead they chose to use Amazon to load new apps.  Amazon provides a more limited selection of apps that may or may not work on this tablet and there doesn't seem to be a method to keep the apps up to date. There is no way to back up or restore the existing Android image. TripMaker is used for laying out multi-stop trips The web site is limited to 25 entries per trip and the TripMaker app on the RV Tablet locks up after about 18 entries, not cool. This is actually  truck trip planning software rather than the Good Sam trip planner that was available thru the docking software used with the earlier RVND GPS devices;rvt80 not cool
0;8.0;1.0;14.0;47.2664285714286;I will start out by saying that I have always used Garmin but purchased this Rand McNally ( the map people ) thinking it would just as good or better as Garmin. The GPS is very hard to use and the mapping is at least 10 years outdated. Needless to say I was very disappointed and retuned it.;Outdated map

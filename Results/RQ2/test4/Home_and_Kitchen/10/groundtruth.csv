2;1.0;4.0;6.0;-9.924789915966358;I like the different colors for the different sections of books.  I agree with the reviewer about the delicate nature of the film.  Be very careful when removing the tabs from the sheet.  I like that there is a tab positioning guide since I would go nuts with a ruler trying to get them aligned evenly and wouldn't sleep if they weren't.  For those of you wracking your brain asking why are there only 71 tabs for 73 books?!?  After ten minutes checking back and forth rattling off all the books and checking tabs, I found that 1, 2, and 3 John are on one tab, labeled 1-3 John.  And Jude and Revelation were in my set!;Worth it
3;2.0;2.0;7.0;6.913461538461561;I should have trusted the many reviews written before me.  These tabs are missing the books of Jude and Revelation.  They are also HORRIBLE about tearing- what I mean is, yes they are fine on the Bible pages.  But when pulling off the sheet to apply, the laminate they are made of is SO thin and poor quality, they tear (think like cheap tape).\n\nI thought these were the same tabs I bought for my old Bible many years ago, and I was wrong.  I have applied for a refund due to the missing tabs and poor quality.  Not what I was expecting...;They are also HORRIBLE about tearing- what I mean is
5;3.0;5.0;17.0;-126.76928571428569;"I've put tabs on lots of Bibles (probably about 20!) for both myself and others.  I've used 3 other styles of tabs, but these are my favorites.  The colors of the tabs indicate the type of biblical book the individual book is: PINK = Pentateuch (the first 5 books, also called the Torah or the Books of Moses: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, & Deuteronomy); ORANGE = Historical Books (Joshua through 2nd Maccabees); YELLOW = Wisdom Books (Job through Sirach); GREEN = Prophetic Books (Isaiah through Malachi); BLUE = Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John); LAVENDER = Rest of the New Testament (Acts, all the Epistles, and Revelation); and PURPLISH-PINK = Non-biblical tabs (e.g., ""Tables,"" ""Concordance,"" ""Charts,"" ""Bible, General,"" ""Helps,"" ""Dictionary,"" etc.)  These tabs look GREAT on my favorite Bible to give as a gift: The New Catholic Answer Bible (NABRE); however, they look great on other Bibles, too.  When I'm putting tabs on beautiful gilt-edged Bibles, however, I usually use the gold-edged Bible tabs made by Tabbies. (The ""Tabbies"" tabs in general are all good quality, well-designed, and easy to use.) But on non-gold-edged Bibles, especially the paperback ones, these rainbow tabs are my favorites because the different colors make it a little easier and faster to find the book I'm looking for.";I LOVE these tabs!
4;4.0;1.0;5.0;45.7557142857143;It says on packaging that it includes the Catholic Books but after starting to put them on, I came to the Catholic Books in the bible and the tabs are missing.  I obviously can't return them since they are stuck on my bible.  Is there a way to reach the company to get correct replacement?;Incorrectly marked
7;5.0;4.0;10.0;-56.41850931677017;For the person who is not as familiar with the Bible as they wish but who still reads it regularly, Tabbies are a near necessity. Each book of the Bible has it's own tab and there are tabs for the extras such as maps, concordance etc. It takes a bit of work to get used to how to put the tab in the right place and to not have more than one page under a tab. The color system helps a lot and the instructions are clear. I have used many tabs for my bibles but I feel that these have been the easiest to get placed in my bible. If you have never used tabs then I recommend that you use this brand and start being able to find a book of the bible easily rather than having to look it up in the front of the book every time you need to flip from one book to another.;Where is that in the bible?
0;6.0;5.0;9.0;48.09500000000002;I purchased these tabs for all of my bibles. The fact that they accomodate all of the Catholic books of the bible was fantastic.  The coloring helps to distinguish sections and makes locating passages much quicker.;Invaluable.
1;7.0;3.0;8.0;39.86318181818183;First of all, these tabs are RAINBOW colored.  If that's what you want, that's great, but there was nothing in the description when I bought them to warn me of this.  Otherwise, the stickers are a thick plastic and look to be of decent quality.  Black edges and words on individual color backgrounds (i.e., some backgrounds are pink, some peach, some yellow, etc.).;Just okay
8;8.0;5.0;7.0;-33.4929927007299;If you are entertaining the notion to take a bible study class, most likely the instructor will ask you to turn to a portion of the bible you have and read chapter and verse in it.  They never give a page number as most people come with their own bible.  Bibles have been re-written, there are upgrades, etc.  Therefore it doesn't do any good to give a page number.  With these tabs you are able to find the book in an instant and then the chapter and verse is a snap to get to.  Then you may keep up with the instructor or even ahead of the whole class.  Don't pass up the chance to stay up with your lessons and be on top of your game.  Blessings to you and your questions all answered.;Where is that passage?
6;9.0;1.0;5.0;15.101250000000022;"I found the ""tabbies"" so difficult to use that I ruined my new hard cover RSV Oxford Bible.  The seller asked me to change my review of the purchase process.  I failed to realize that I evaluated the wrong thing.  The seller is fine, but the product stinks.  I now have a ruined Bible and will replace it, but will never buy tabs again.\n\nI have to worry about replacing the Bible--will buy one already indexed.\n\nP.S.  This is the last review I will do.  I do not have time for the hassle.";Ruined brand new RSV Bible

3 4 height correct s actually 8 1 2 tall big deal know m trying literal idea dimensions m sure ruler n t wrong n nto size thing perfectly fine knew big would based reading reviews seeing dimensions listed n t mind s acutally slightly smaller advertised either listed weight 2 07 pounds including bag per web site n t weigh sure seems right food put d think added less 1 2 pound 2 5 pounds total lunch n t see problem whatsoever plus bag handy long strap problems carrying weight n n cleaning nthis one main concerns ll probably deal cleaned soup bowl little ago started writing review fact washed nicely easy soup dark bowl white s stains leftover residue hard clean ll take care others get home s concern normally lunch may bring s separate containers rubbermade ziplock whatever go dishwasher so clean breeze stuff n t supposed go dishwasher though one thing n t like since one would n t washing dishwasher every day anyway wo n t bringing work every single day s little sanitary like wash things dishwasher make sure s clean instance bring coffee cup work home twice month run cycle n t options which probably 4 stars instead 5 n ni really n t understand something microwave safe holding starting temps 200f per web site ca n t handle dishwasher quick online search dishwasher temperatures show generally 140 150 range dishwashers heating elements bring quite bit higher dry dishes n t really n t seem actually dry dishes anyway d think warning like dishwasher safe top rack air dry would suffice wonder reasons another reviewer product said lost valve soup bowl always wash parts dishwasher so d think work fine dishwasher n t take statement truth please may try see ll add comment review later let know went n n overall quality nthis big plus unit seems made extremely well clips strong lids stay tight large main container soup bowl lids little tough take screw tight n nthe spoon probably easily looked actually pretty nice addon value added item like comes hard plastic cover snaps plus s place inside bag well helps stay place bag comes another nice feature really n t think d expect put honestly d expect companies add something buy another 10 whatever kudos zojirushi two things n n final words ni really like lunch container far issue stated containers n t dishwasher safe least say n t re microwave safe n t make sense othewise s fantastic product recommend anyone thinks d use key right n n d

5;1.0;5.0;6.0;28.193750000000023;Wife wanted to buy the whole set after receiving this 9-inch and 11-inch whisk. The previous whisks are all falling apart and rusting. These ones are sealed to prevent water getting inside the handle (smart!).\n\nThe only down side is that these probably aren't as safe to use on certain cookware. Our previous ones were silicone and safe to use on anything.;Wife wanted to buy the whole set after receiving this ...
2;2.0;5.0;114.0;-19.52959999999996;I am a quadriplegic/tetraplegic (C5-6 if you care).  I have about 1/3 use of my hands and 1/2 use of my arms.  I can use most whisks with some effort, however, this Oxo one is almost effort-free for me.  I even whip  small amounts of cream (1/2 pint or less) because this whisk works so well  for me.\nMy mother, who has mild arthritis, loves this whisk as well.\nThis whisk is a nice size for whipping up a small amount of eggs (2-8),  cream, crepes, etc.  You'll need a full size whisk for more substantial  recipes.\nAs with most Oxo tools it is very ergonomically designed: it  fits the hand and does the job it is supposed to do.;I even whip cream now
10;3.0;5.0;29.0;-163.90011627906972;"Not only is this my favorite whisk, it is truly well made. While making a custard filling for caramel eclairs (you know those magical eclairs in the Simply Irresistible movie) I found that the balloon shape and the way the wires adapt themselves to the shape of a saucepan was highly desirable.\n\nFor one thing, you don't want any clumping in a sauce or custard and things do tend to get clumpy if you can't get into the inner edge of a saucepan. With a bit of pressure, you can whisk into every inch of a saucepan. This is not always possible with a plastic whisk which is definitely not as flexible.\n\nThe handle on this whisk makes it easy to keep a grip and OXO is known for their ergonomic considerations. I think of it as an almost suede rubber that is not only comfortable to hold, it allows your hand to grip the handle more firmly.\n\nNow the reason the 10 stainless-steel wires are so sturdy is because they are sealed into the base with a clear resin material. This also prevents food from building up and I throw this whisk in the dishwasher without fear.\n\nIf you bang the wires against your hand you can see how sturdy this whisk is and I can almost imagine that somewhere in the world someone is using this whisk as a musical instrument.\n\nWhen the cookbook says ""whisk"" this is the one I'd highly\nrecommend.\n\n~The Rebecca Review";The Perfect Whisk
7;4.0;5.0;13.0;-28.02616541353379;I have several larger whisks but needed a smaller one for smallish jobs such as whisking dressings, etc.  Most smallish type whisks I looked at in stores were too light weight and just lacked the proper feel in hand to be a good blending tool.  When I saw this whisk on Amazon, I instantly knew this was my whisk.\n\nAnd sure enough, I couldn't be more pleased with the weight and feel of this whisk.\n\n***update***\n\nI've now owned this whisk about six weeks and find myself reaching for this one before the others much of the time,  I originally didn't think it would be useful for much more than small batches like dressings,  however, because of its size, there's more torque making blending faster.;Perfectly SMALL
12;5.0;5.0;16.0;8.10307692307694;"I use my Oxo 9"" whisk for many different recipes (whipping air into eggs, mixing liquid ingredients, etc.), and it always performs like a pro and goes straight into the dishwasher for easy cleanup. My only recommendation would be to invest in a silicone-coated whisk as well; this will scratch up your nonstick cookware, but it works great for mixing and other general kitchen duties.";Easy to use and dishwasher-safe
6;6.0;1.0;7.0;34.83000000000003;It's puny!\nA 10-inch chef's knife has a 10-inch blade and a handle. A 12-inch skillet has a 12-inch cooking vessel and a handle. The longest wire loop of this whisk is 4-3/4 inches and the handle is 4 inches. Please, check my math but I can't find any way this whisk measures 9 inches!\nWhat am I gonna do with this tiny imitation of a cooking tool?\nHummingbird omelettes, anyone?;tiny whisk, big deception
3;7.0;4.0;19.0;43.00500000000004;All oxo products are a dream to use, so the whisk was a very welcome  addition to my kitchen stash. The handle is so comfortable, that it makes  each and every whisking job a breeze.  The only reason I give it four stars  rather than five, is the fact that I have difficulty cleaning the small  ripples on the handle.;Oxo Whisk
1;8.0;5.0;13.0;2.52500000000002;When I ordered this whisk I was slightly unsure about its usefulness, but I did know my smallest existing whisk was too large to get into the corners of small sauce pans (with straight sides) and too clumsy for whisking a couple of eggs in a small bowl.\n\nOxo has nailed it again.  This whisk reaches into the corners of small pans, is just right for mixing a few eggs or incorporating ingredients into a pan sauce.  The handle is comfortable.  I'm a hero at home for making this purchase.  Thanks Oxo.;Terrific whisk for small jobs
0;9.0;5.0;12.0;-111.66358208955221;Unlike some of the previous, uneducated reviewers, I knew prior to ordering this item that it was not used for making Whiskey. I knew that it was for beating things, such as eggs, whipped cream, and unruly children. (The latter is an optional use - I would use the 11-inch whisk, also available from amazon, or a heavy iron spoon). In short, this tool does its job with aplomb. I enjoy whisking all manner of items, and find myself using this item when it really isn't necessary at all. Just this morning I whisked myself a milk and organge juice smoothie, and followed that up by vigorously whisking my bowl of Rasin Bran. Sure, flakes and milk ended up all over the place, but each cereal shard was coated with nice frothy milk. I have even used this whisk to create my own flavors of toothpaste, mixing the best of several of my favorite brands into one bowl and wisking it into a greenish-brown blob of tooth-whitening goodness. Overall, this whisk is superb at doing what it was meant to do, and then some. I think I may use it tonight to whisk together a bowl of chiken soup puree! YUM!;The Whiskiest!
11;10.0;5.0;8.0;-127.93275109170303;"I bought this whisk because my old one finally broke (2 of the wires popped out).  When I was browsing for a new one, I didn't really know how the whisk was measured.  This one is the ""11-inch"" model, but I didn't know from what to what was included in that measurement.  Now I know!  The measurement is from one end to the other tip, and not just the metal part, for anybody else who might be in the dark about this.  I am thrilled with this whisk.  I also have a silicon-covered whisk, which is not so great, especially when stirring pudding that you have to stir forever.  (I am not a fan of the instant/no stir type.) That silicon-covered whisk leaves a thick coat of pudding sludge on the bottom of my pan, because it isn't actually scraping the pan like a metal one.  I like that these wires are shaped in an elongated manner instead of a more puffed-out shape, it seems to get the job done very well.  I guess my old whisk was really junky, but this one is great. Also the rubber handle is comfortable to hold.  I don't find the length too long either, something that is actually an issue, as I am a petite person (""short"") and long cooking tools are too difficult to deal with.";Awesome whisk!
8;11.0;5.0;6.0;22.130000000000024;This is almost a hybrid of the flat whisks and the balloon type.  I use this several times per week and love the small size.  It's great for mixing dry ingredients instead of sifting for baking, for mixing batter, egg replacers, and for dissolving green superfood powders into juices and water.  Oxo is a staple in my kitchen--I love their stuff.  Do measure because it's small--a feature I really like.;Small and Wonderful
9;12.0;5.0;5.0;-31.452611940298482;"I love all the Oxo Good Grips kitchen utensils because they are so comfortable to use.  I use this little 9"" whisk a lot for small jobs.  It is perfect for mixing up a little thickening for gravy, whisking a few eggs to use in recipes when baking, or for scrambling eggs.  A larger whisk won't fit in measuring cups or small bowls.\n\nSince I have arthritis in my hands, I find the Oxo good grips kitchen utensils to be the most comfortable on the market. One little bit of advice is to rinse the whisk immediately after using to make clean-up easier.  I made the mistake of letting food dry on it a couple of times, and it made cleaning it more difficult. I highly recommend this whisk for all cooks.";**My Favorite Oxo Good Grips Utensil**

23;3.0;5.0;310.0;-121.83019230769226;"Excerpt from Cook's Illustrated testing of measuring spoons:\n\n""Even cooks who can't be bothered to pull out a measuring spoon for stovetop recipes know that such cavalier imprecision (read: eyeballing) won't cut it when baking. But which brand is best?\n\nAfter filling nine spoons to level, then carefully weighing the contents, we concluded that every brand was sufficiently accurate. So preferences came down to design. We measure dry ingredients by scooping a heaping spoonful, then sweeping it to level (a method we call ""dip and sweep""). Easy enough -- unless the shape of the spoon hinders either the dipping or the sweeping. Fat spoons, spoons with short handles, overly bulky spoons, and spoons with raised handles all made this task more difficult. When measuring out liquid ingredients, shallow spoons posed a higher risk of spillage than deep spoons.\n\nWhere did we end up? The sturdy Cuisipro spoons feature an elongated, oval shape that proved optimal for scooping ingredients from narrow jar. In addition, the ends of the handles curl down, putting them level with the spoon's base and thereby allowing a full measure to be set down on the counter with no tipping and no mess. Perfection is in the details.""";Which brand is best?
1;4.0;5.0;124.0;-78.3343195266272;"My first reaction when I picked up this set was ""wow - these feel like professional hand tools"".  They're stiff enough to let you scoop fridge-hardened butter without bending, unlike Mom's nesting measuring  spoons.  They're polished, hefty and attractive - and still nest together  so neatly that they take up less space in my drawer than the individual  spoons we replaced.  They're also much easier to find when we go fishing  around in the kitchen drawer because they're all together.\nTheir best  feature, though, is the elongated shape.  Anything you need only a half  teaspoon of is usually stored in a little bottle, right?  With most  measuring spoons you have to pour the spices into the spoon because the  spoon doesn't fit easily inside the bottle.  These are a natural fit,  making the task easier and less messy.\nYou'll never regret upgrading a  tool you use almost every time you cook.  Treat yourself to a basic tool  that doesn't feel basic at all.";Solid, beautiful, and the oval shape really works better

3;6.0;2.0;17.0;-153.0534615384615;I got these because Cook's Illustrated gave them a top rating.  They may be worth that rating, IF you get a good set.  I got one from Amazon and found the edges on several of the spoons was pitted.  Amazon did a quick return/replacement and I found the second set was also pitted and the handles scratched.  I returned those for a refund.  Sur La Table carries them also and I was able to find an acceptable set there, but only after searching through what they had on the shelf.\n\nThis is actually the second set of measuring spoons I use.  The main one is a set of rectangular spoons from Endurance (now RSVP??).  It has one additional spoon in its set, and all fit into my spice jars.  The Cuisipro set has only 5 spoons, the 1 tbls size does not fit in most of my spice jars, and all the handles are shorter than the Endurance so don't reach as far into the jar.  However, these spoons are a bit deeper than the Endurance ones, and the handle is shaped to allow them to sit flat on the countertop.  I thought they would therefore be better for liquids.  We'll see if that is true in use.\n\nIn any case, given the quality issues I had with the Cuisipro spoons, I only gave them 2 stars, even though they're probably fine when you get a good set.  However, if I was only going to have one set, it would be the Endurance.;OK If You Are Selective
17;7.0;4.0;31.0;-702.2203846153845;"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cuisipro-Stainless-Measuring-Spoons/dp/B001Q8XVXI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cuisipro Stainless Measuring Spoons</a>\n\nI splurged! I long ago replaced cookware with non-reactive, non-toxic stainless, cast iron and vitreous enamels, and food storage containers with glass. It was time to enshrine my aluminum measuring spoon set in a kitchen museum from the 50's. I hadn't been doing much measuring when cooking, but now that we are venturing into new food genres and trying new recipes in general (had been in a meal rut!) bringing the aluminum set out of retirement bothered me.\n\nHere is my rundown for the Cuispro set (oval, standard size measurements):\n\nPros\n- Well-made; good weight, not flimsy.\n- Attractive: the oval-shaped bowls of each spoon are mirror-finish stainless and very pretty.\n- Engraved markings preferable to painted. The handles are satin matte stainless with engraved markings indicating measure.\n- No Spill, sits flat on counter: I was concerned about the oval rounded bottoms being 'tippy' but they do seem to sit flat on the counter without spilling.\n- Can sweep ingredient flat, the handle is level with tops of spoons. Important feature that surpisingly, not all sets allow.\n- Fits in spice jars. Oval shape allows all but the tablespoon size to fit in most jars. Less spillage and waste. Just a good, well-thought out and very practical advantage. Much better than trying to shake spices into a tiny spoon. Yes, experienced cooks don't measure...but sometimes you need to and when you do, these are great.\n- Double-key ring is heavy-duty - keeps them together, if you like that. However, removing spoons from the ring is a major decision as it would take some effort on my part to do so. Neither would I care to change my mind and have to put them back on this sturdy ring as it is a difficult exercise, either way. I've been trying for a good five minutes, breaking sweat! This will take a tool and possibly someone other than myself to do the job. I don't want to scratch my new spoons!\n\nCons\n- Could use even more visible markings... My eyesight needs help. The engraving depth on the 1/2 teaspoon is uneven (not as deep throughout the length of the text and fainter) than it is on the others. Still, prefer this to painted markings that wear off with use/washing. And far prefer stainless to flimsier old-style aluminum that I still own or modern plastics. Would prefer even deeper engraving for better, easier visibility without eye-strain. (Deducting one star for this, reluctantly, as visibility is very important factor for me, personally.)\n\nFeatures for the Perfect Measuring Spoon Set  - (This set plus Hoped for Improvements) - take note, measuring spoon manufacturers! All important features, but listed in ascending order:\n1. Easily removable ring (which magnets would eliminate the need for.) Wish this set was easier to remove from ring.\n2. Magnetic Attraction: Would love to see a set like this one that magnetically sticks to one another to keep them together. Saw another brand on amazon that is magnetic, but reviews said the magnet inset falls out! I find separate spoons so much easier to use as I find all-on-ring design cumbersome and I invariably get them all dirty so need to wash all instead of one or two, etc...Would love for them to stay spooning in storage eliminating the hunt...even keeping them all in a cup rather than a drawer it takes time to find The One. Embedded magnets would mean no more searching for size needed for that recipe.\n3. Level handle/spoon so you can sweep the ingredient flat (as these have.)\n4. Spoons stand on counter without tipping over or spilling contents (as these do.)\n5. Fits in spice jars. Narrow enough bowl to get in and fill up. (all but tablespoon fits, but that size in other sets don't fit inside jars either, unless your spices are in wide-mouth decorative jars.)\n6. Very easy to read at a glance markings (no time wasted holding them up to the light to read markings; no eye strain.)- This set could be improved a bit in this department.\n7. Heavy, high quality stainless steel: no food interaction, no staining, easy washing, attractive (as these are.)\n\nOver all, this is a very nice set, sturdy enough to be handed down to the next generation provided the engraved markings don't wear down with use...which, of course, will depend on how much use they see in your kitchen and whether you hand-wash or throw these in the dishwasher.)";Nearly Perfect

This is a poor quality low luster stainless..I have a set of measuring spoons and cups from Cuisipro that I purchased 2 years ago..very nice high quality stainless.

18;9.0;2.0;25.0;-315.15999999999997;I knew in my gut that if Cooks Illustrated endorsed these, there had to be something wrong. Sorry guys, but the emperor has no clothes--virtually every CI recommendation I've ever come across for a product with which I have personal experience has left me bug-eyed and shaking my head incredulously. (Imagine my relief and delight upon learning that others in a Yahoo group to which I belong share my feelings.)\n\nThese Cuisipro measuring spoons are no exception. However, at the price I paid for them, I WANTED to believe, in spite of the fact that CI endorsements make me and my wallet hightail it to another product page. Stupid me.\n\nMuch has been made by previous reviewers about the quality of these spoons and as it turns out, they're quite right, hence the two stars. They're very heavy and are nicely finished as well. But the fact of the matter is that, unlike my cheap-o plastic spoons, four of these tablespoons do NOT measure  cup in any of my measuring vessels, only some of which are produced by the same manufacturer and all of which are equal to each other. A level teaspoon of dry matter measured in the Cuisipro spoons deviate from my other spoons by several grams when weighed--a not insignificant amount. To make matters worse, they're not even accurate among themselves. Three teaspoonfuls don't equal a tablespoon, two  teaspoonfuls don't equal  teaspoon, and I think you get the idea by this time. Pathetic.\n\nTo add insult to injury, they're fastened by not one, but TWO rings (wow!). These spoons seem to be undergoing an identity crisis and so are held together as though they're keys: you not only have your basic ball key chain but your difficult-to-remove key ring as well. Say goodbye to your nails as you ponder why Cuisipro couldn't pony up with a pop-open binder ring like the one on my wonderful Amco measuring cups.\n\nI'm very, VERY disappointed with these spoons. I've wanted some heavy, stainless spoons that would fit a spice jar for a long time and at the last minute, swayed by the reviews and the price, I decided against the Amco and went with these. I wanted to make sure I got my 2 in before requesting a return label--these are going back.\nFlamers and fan boys, on your mark, ...;NOT Accurate
4;10.0;1.0;13.0;-76.49567415730336;The measurements for the teaspoon and tablespoon are NOT accurate. I have the same brand of measuring spoons bought several years ago. After ordering a second set and using both sets while making a recipe I noted the the new teaspoon looked shallower than my old teaspoon. I measured using both dry and liquid (using a syringe to calibrate the ml). The new teaspoon holds 4 ml of liquid while the old teaspoon holds 5 ml, a 20% difference! While measuring dry (I used sugar) it took four teaspoons to equal a tablespoon. My original set was 3 teaspoons to the tablespoon which is the standard. By the way, the new tablespoon held 13 ml of liquid while the old tablespoon held 15 ml of liquid. The smaller spoons in the new set were accurate.\nI recognize that when baking its better to use the metric system but that is no excuse for this difference. Unfortunately I didn't use the spoons until after 30 days so I could not return them. Into the trash they will go.;I recognize that when baking its better to use the metric system but that is no ...

14;12.0;3.0;17.0;-104.57321782178214;Ordered these a while ago for a Christmas present for my wife. Just got a chance to look closely at them before wrapping and was disappointed to find the top spoon (the only one you can see as they come packaged) had half the marking not even readable. There were other less serious but noticable issues with the marking on the next two sizes up as well. Only the two largest were in good shape from a printing standpoint. They seem to be impact marked or stamped, and they need to improve either the process or the tools used. Amazon is out of stock so I have to give the damaged ones with a note that I need them back in returnable condition when the replacements arrive. AWKWARD! I wonder if Amazon needed to return a whole shipment and wait for a new batch from the factory because of an issue like this, and that's why they are out of stock. Overall they look like they will be nice once I get a good set, but it is terrible inconvenient for a relatively inexpensive item like this to have to return. Almost not worth my time, but it's the principle.;Quality control on marking/imprinting process?
8;13.0;3.0;12.0;31.53000000000003;This set is heavy duty as other reviewers have reported. At the same time, the metal is roughly finished in parts, with uneven surfaces and some sharp edges. I haven't tested the volumes, but the spoons aren't perfectly symmetrical and so there's a good chance the measurements might be a tad off.\n\nI decided to keep the set since I like the heft and it's good enough.;Heavy duty and practical, but a tad rough

6;17.0;5.0;6.0;-91.5333333333333;If ever there were a line of luxury measuring spoons, this is it. They're high-polish and beautiful, and they have an oval shape that fits more easily into jars than other spoons. The stamped measurement on the handle will last for years to come (I avoid printed measurements because they wear off). The key ring keeps them together and the little curve at the end of the spoon means you can theoretically set the spoon on the counter without it tipping over, although I still prefer to simply use mixing bowls. Great product - my roommate loved them so much she bought a set when we moved out!\n\nUpdate December 2015: I purchased a set of these as a gift. I examined them before gifting and they looked just like mine - no rough edges. Mine are still beautiful after 2+ years of use and being washed in the dishwasher (though they are very easy to clean by hand). The tablespoon measure fits into a spice jar as shown, but it does take a deep scoop and a shake to level it off (because there is not much clearance).;Favorite measuring spoon set - durable and gorgeous

ARE Great! they are of a nice (heavy) sturdy quality. They are easy to grip / hold, even for my arthritic and muscle damaged hand.\nAs for the price (see #2), I've spent more just ""trying"" out cheaper sets. I want the best quality for the lowest price. That's why I shop Amazon. Honestly, please don't let the price stop you from buying these. There are others that are much, much more expensive and serve the same purpose. Depending on your viewpoint you can consider these as either, the high end of inexpensive OR the lower (in price not lowest for value) end of quality.\nThey hang, or nestle, together on what I can only describe as a ""key chain"" ring. Very nice. You could remove them like you would a key from a ring if you want to reach for them individually, as I do. They still nestle well without the ring.

1;1.0;5.0;22.0;42.734375000000014;I like it. Great quality, sharp blades, looks very durable, plus nice stainless still color, I can put it in my kitchen without my wife sending it back to the counter (that would be the case if she didn't approve the color). I grind coffe already and cumin seeds, I can say that it's very easy to operate - just press one button.;High quality, easy to operate, durable
2;2.0;5.0;34.0;43.70932203389832;this grinds my coffee beans fast and and evenly. I used the bistro blade before and this grinder grinds the beans to perfection. I thought bistro worked well, but once I tried this blade mill, I was amazed. its grippy on the outside and the lid closes tight, so no spilling over the sides. I highly recommend this grinder.;grinds beans to perfection
6;3.0;5.0;18.0;48.49357142857143;I have bought several coffee grinders this works best!! And very reasonably priced. I will definitely buy this again when needed (probably will buy again as a backup!);Good Coffee Grinder!
3;4.0;5.0;5.0;23.844936708860786;I bought this to grind spices. It grinds all kinds of spices (including cinnamon sticks) that I tried into powder form.\nThis grinder does the job beautifully, giving me close to a powder even with fairly hard substances.\nAlso we needed one to grind eggshells to use in our dog's raw meat diet. And it was easy.\nWe love this grinder. This is the best grinder we've used.\nEasy to wash and clean after each use.\nRecommend!;Great efficient grinder!
4;5.0;1.0;10.0;-229.3450591715976;"The company is called ""Coffee Art"". And, it's true that if you want a coffee grinder that looks like a space ship this one is pretty arty.\n\nHowever, if you want a cup of coffee I'd suggest trying something else.\n\nThis grinder follows in the extremely-popular ""form over function"" philosophy that has made Apple a gazillion-dollar success. Unlike Apple, however, the manufacturer clearly didn't do any user testing on their design before they went into production. Let me explain:\n\nThe lid is the stainless-steel dome above the black band in the picture. The lid is twisted to remove or replace; it has a bayonet-style lock/unlock mechanism: after putting in your coffee beans you replace the lid and twist it clockwise until the indicator points at the lock icon. You don't have to twist it very far, maybe 20 degrees of rotation.\n\nThe only catch is that the part you twist is basically the top of a stainless-steel ball. There's literally nothing to grab except round, smooth steel. You thought opening that jar of mustard was hard! Hah! This lid will see your mustard jar and raise it 6 old jars of Aunt Betty's marmalade.\n\nFortunately, it's not like people grind coffee beans in the MORNING WHEN THEY NEED A !@#$% CUP OF COFFEE AND THERE'S NO GROUNDS AND I CAN'T GET THE !@#$%^ LID TO LINE UP WITH THE @#$%^ING THING WITH THE OTHER !@#$%^ING THING WHY IS IT DOING THIS TO ME???\n\nTL/DR: if you want a manual dexterity/small motor skill challenge first thing the morning, by all means get the Coffee Art coffee mill.\n\nIf you actually want a cup of coffee, go buy grounds from Buckies or else some other grinder. Oh, and by the way? If you REALLY like coffee, don't get a blade grinder--they all do a crap job of grinding coffee. Get a proper burr grinder. They cost more but they're worth it.";Occupational therapy yes. Coffee no.

9;7.0;5.0;19.0;-148.31642857142853;I received a set of these as a review sample because I entertain a lot and wanted an inexpensive set of forks that were not cheap plastic.\n\nThese are not the flimsy stuff that a two year old can bend. And therein is the surprise. They are 7 3/8 inches long and nicely finished (they seem to be a polished stainless, but I am not sure.) They weigh 1.3 ounces, so they are a big cut above dollar store flatware.\n\nThe one test that convinced me that there are better quality than the cheap ones was running them through a dishwasher. There was no discoloration or pitting. There is one curious aspect and that is the tines and most of the handle are magnetic. The flared handle end is not. For the life of me I cannot figure that one out, but they do not bend like the cheap flatware, and the salvage value of the metal is probably at least fifty percent the twelve and a half bucks a three dozen set is going for at the time of this review.\n\nIf you do a lot of entertaining and want serving forks for BBQs that are more classy than the shiny plastic ones that seem to be in vogue, these merit consideration. Even if you wash and reuse some of the better plastic ones they are not going to last anywhere near as long as these. I would love to track down matching spoons and knives.;Surprisingly high quality

I love that its made in America. Their stones clean up with no problem in the dishwasher. I will continue to buy their baking dishes. I have their muffin pan and there is no comparison to how well my muffins turn out being baked in it versus using my old metal tins. LOVE HARTSTONE, cant recommend their products enough!!!;I LOVE my heartstone pottery!!!
17;15.0;3.0;8.0;-43.916092715231756;I love this baking stone.  It bakes wonderfully and I love that it is non-toxic.  However, the first one I got was broken. It was easily replaced.  The second one I received broke within 2 weeks.  It got a hairline crack in the middle of the handle and when I picked it up it literally just tore in 2 pieces as easily as a piece of paper.  I don't know what happened.  I really want to love this and I really want to replace it with another, but I am leery of this happening again.  I don't know if I just got a lemon or if this is normal with stone baking ware.  This is my first piece of stone baking ware so maybe I did something wrong.  I love this stone so much that I'll probably order another and try again.  Third time's a charm, right?;I love it, but it broke...twice
8;16.0;5.0;7.0;-60.290700636942645;"I hate plastic forks but sometime have had to use them for large gatherings since I don't have enough flatware. This solves that problem  its an affordable way to have a boatload of forks for casual get togethers.\n\nEach fork comes in an individual plastic sleeve, and are bundled together in a box. They are well-packed for transit  even if UPS does a dance on the box as they sometimes seem to do there won't be any scratches or damage to the forks.\n\nThe design is pretty plain but I find it to be attractive. The forks feel very substantial. You can bend one if you try, but they are more than thick enough to stand up to a lot of normal use. The tines are machined well to a smooth finish; and the handles are highly polished.\n\nVery pleased with these and would certainly recommend them.\n[Sample provided for review]";"Nicely made; plain but attractive design"
18;17.0;5.0;7.0;-108.29641791044773;Don't second guess yourself on this one, this is an honest company that makes fabulous bakeware! The cookie sheet is perhaps my favorite so far (we also purchased the pie pan, muffin pan and loaf pan).\n\nWhen this first arrived, I washed it in warm water and wiped it will grapseed oil. I baked some of my homemade sugar cookies on it (refrigerated batch from yesterday) and they baked beautifully and tasted 1,000 times better than they did with parchment paper on an aluminum pan. The cookie sheet really brought out the flavors of the butter and sugar, even my husband noticed the difference! :)The cookies did not stick at all and it was so easy to scoop them off the stone with a spatula. The bottom of the cookies were soft with a heavenly crisp to it (not hard and browned). It takes a little bit longer to bake things, but I guarantee you it is worth every minute!\n\nThe texture is soft and the weight is nice and heavy. We are SO happy with our purchase and feel it will last us a lifetime, we will continue to recommend this company for years to come! :);Truly a wonderful company and product!
7;18.0;5.0;6.0;-104.92925373134325;"Whether you need extra dinner forks for your restaurant, catering business, or just to have on hand for those special occasions, these are excellent quality.  Each four-tined fork (sharp) is 7-2/8"" long with a simple, clean design to suit any venue from simple to formal.  Although not stated, they appear to be a standard 18/8 stainless, which should provide corrosion-resistance.\n\nThey are not the type that easily bends washes up quite nicely. The best way to take care of flatware is to warm by hand and immediately buff and dry when done.  This keeps water spots from forming and will keep these dinner forks looking nice in-between use.  They come in individual sleeves and can be tucked back in them for storage.\n\nThese forks are quite a good value for what you are getting.  Perhaps you could be nine dozen plastic ones for the same price, but why buy disposable when you can get the ""real"" thing for a reasonable price?  I love the simple pattern, the heft of the stainless, and tines that don't bend when they are used.  Very nice set of forks for anyone to have on hand.\n\nSample provided for review.";Very nice heavy-duty forks to have for either commercial use or to have on hand for those special occasions ...
10;19.0;5.0;5.0;-1.322727272727235;This is the first baking mat I have ever owned - and now I am wondering why I waited so long. This is fabulous! It makes clean up so easy - and I think my cookies bake more evenly!  I love the color coded edge - it makes it easy to space your cookies out without getting too close to the edge. This is a well made product.\n\nThe packaging was also very nice and the delivery arrived in a very timely manner. I even got an email confirming my order. First class seller.\n\nYou can buy this with confidence.;This is great!!

The money I'm saving from no longer needing to buy baking spray and wax paper is a plus! Definitely a great purchase and will be buying more in the future for myself. Also a great gift idea for friends and family. Highly recommended!;Great buy - highly recommended!
20;21.0;5.0;5.0;-15.668849557522094;I had bought this to open baby food jars when my son started eating solids and have used it for everything from soda bottles to jars of pasta sauce since then. Three years later, my mother-in-law (who has arthritis) saw me using it during a recent visit and commented that she should get one.  I gave her mine saying that I'd get another one.  I didn't realize how often I used it until I gave it away.  Being the mother of two under 3.5 I've finally gotten the chance to order another one and am amused at how excited I am about having one in my kitchen drawer again!;Fantastic!

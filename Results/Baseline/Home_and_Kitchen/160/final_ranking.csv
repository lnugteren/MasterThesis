nas far top two containers pretty much room temperature inside advertised snacks trying keep cold note bottom 2 containers retain heat cold levels top two insulated intended maintain temperatures found outside unit read heating cooling lids ahead time also help retain temperatures desire try too n n size weight nso seen reviews people complaining size thing large others say small say heavy others say way heavy obviously going perosnal choice d rather give details let make decision based people opinions may own n nfrom zojirushi web site ndimensions w x x h 6 x 5 3 8 x 8 3 4 inches n nthe width 6 widest point includes clips sides depth 5 3 8 must smaller area without clips correct width tube top bottom 5 8 3 4 height correct actually 8 1 2 tall big deal know m trying literal idea dimensions m sure ruler wrong n nto size thing perfectly fine knew big would based reading reviews seeing dimensions listed mind acutally slightly smaller advertised either listed weight 2 07 pounds including bag per web site weigh sure seems right food put d think added less 1 2 pound 2 5 pounds total lunch see problem whatsoever plus bag handy long strap problems carrying weight n n cleaning nthis one main concerns probably deal cleaned soup bowl little ago started writing review fact washed nicely easy soup dark bowl white stains leftover residue hard clean take care others get home concern normally lunch may bring separate containers rubbermade ziplock whatever go dishwasher clean breeze stuff supposed go dishwasher though one thing like since one would washing dishwasher every day anyway wo bringing work every single day little sanitary like wash things dishwasher make sure clean instance bring coffee cup work home twice month run cycle options probably 4 stars instead 5 n ni really understand something microwave safe holding starting temps 200f per web site ca handle dishwasher quick online search dishwasher temperatures show generally 140 150 range dishwashers heating elements bring quite bit higher dry dishes really seem actually dry dishes anyway d think warning like dishwasher safe top rack air dry would suffice wonder reasons another reviewer product said lost valve soup bowl always wash parts dishwasher d think work fine dishwasher take statement truth please may try see add comment review later let know went n n overall quality nthis big plus unit seems made extremely well clips strong lids stay tight large main container soup bowl lids little tough take screw tight n nthe spoon probably easily looked actually pretty nice addon value added item like comes hard plastic cover snaps plus place inside bag well helps stay place bag comes another nice feature really think d expect put honestly d expect companies add something buy another 10 whatever kudos zojirushi two things n n final words ni really like lunch container far issue stated containers dishwasher safe least say re microwave safe make sense othewise fantastic product recommend anyone thinks d use key right n n d

3;1.0;5.0;5.0;Just pretend you are Mrs. Patmore and use it as she would. Hold it firmly, take command of it, but don't try to break it!! It works smoothly and fits comfortably in your hand. It is beautiful to look at. I keep it on the kitchen counter in an old tea saucer to keep the crumbs clear & I can always find it!  Fresh ground nutmeg is one of those things you don't realize you need until you have it!!! And having the extra nuts right there is handy. I flip the nut when it is ground down and get pretty full use out of it. The tiny leftover chunks go in a spice ball on the stove on low simmer to flavor the air. It is all good!;Pretend You Are Mrs. Patmore!
16;2.0;4.0;40.0;"I just want to write a counter-review to the one star review posted here that has been voted as helpful. Though I agree this grater has some faults, it does not merit a one star review in any way.\n\nIn two years of using the walnut wood colored version of this grater (there are many color option for the bottom half of the grater), I have found 3 minor faults:\n\n1) Incomplete shaving - After shaving halfway thru a nutmeg, you will need to open the shaver and flip the nut over (rounded side down) in order to shave the other half down. Even then, after you finish the second ""half"" you will be left with a wafer of nutmeg about 3/32"" thick that it will no longer shave. On the other hand, if you were to grate by hand you will also end up with an unusable piece unless you're very fastidious and careful. (Also, if you do it by hand, you will likely be grating not shaving - maybe a small distinction, but important to some people) Either way, I don't really count this as a fault. I just toss the little wafer in the compost and move on without regret. It's still much easier to use than a hand grater.\n\n2) The opening and closing of the shaver is actually simple and easy in itself. Unless, you want to keep nuts in the clear dome portion for visual impact. Then, it becomes a balancing act of keeping the bottom half level while you compress and twist the top half down. This is because there is only a very small lip on the bottom half keeping the nuts from rolling out before putting the two halves together. But seriously people, it's NOT that hard to do. Put the bottom half on the counter, load your nut in the middle, load the ""ornamental"" nuts around the perimeter, then, push the top half down and twist 1/10 of a turn. If that's too hard, just store the ornamental nuts somewhere else. Does not warrant a 1 star review of ""useless""!\n\n3) No one else has mentioned this but the screw on top that holds the twisting lever kept loosening on mine. I merely applied a little thread lock compound to the screw (a year ago) and have never had a problem since.\n\nThe actual shaving mechanism (and this IS a shaver, NOT a grater) is unquestionably good. Very fine shavings come off releasing a delicious amount of aroma adding flavor without encountering distractingly coarse chunks. You can evaluate the appearance yourself from the picture, but as far as these things go, I think the appearance is exceptional no matter what color you choose. Four stars, minus one star for three minor faults.\n\nUPDATE: 12/26/09: bought some new nutmegs and received a couple really large nuts that did not fit in the ornamental dome casing. They DID fit in the hole where the shaving action takes place but not in the storage area dome. Another fault to this device but I still think it is a four star product.";To address the previous 1 star review
18;3.0;1.0;34.0;"This is an attractive grater, and it is relatively sturdy (though some of the chrome you see is actually plastic). But there are core problems, which I have experienced in the 8 months I have owned it. I frequently grind spices.\n\nThe first problem is that it is hard to load. The bizarre engineering requires that you open the grater in the middle, which causes all the whole nutmegs to fall out. It is awkward to keep the nutmegs inside while also loading the nutmeg which is currently being grated.\n\nThe more important problem is a fatal design flaw in how the nutmeg being grated is held. Generally, it grates a nutmeg part of the way, and then the ""teeth"" inside which grip the nutmeg strip the nutmeg (like stripping a screw), and you are unable to continue grating. The result is that I have a lot of half-grated nutmegs.\n\nIt might, nevertheless, be your best option.";Attractive -- and useless
2;4.0;5.0;30.0;This nutmeg shaver is fantastic.  Turn it one direction for a course grind and the other for a finer grind.  The thicker grind is perfect for recipes, while the thinner grind is just fine enough to put on top of your iced cap.\n\nThe design is simple and clean.  You can always see how much nutmeg you have left and its really easy to drop a new seed into the grinder.\n\nKnowing Peugeot, this thing will last a REALLY long time.\n\nCheck out the rest of their collection if you like freshly ground anything!;Fresh shave
9;5.0;5.0;13.0;Being an avid cook I enjoy fresh ground spices.  For years I enjoyed a pretty good nutmeg grinder, but when it broke, I replaced it with less expensive grinders than the Peugeot and each was just a waste of money.  The Peugeot is substantial in weight, has storage for additional seeds and grinds beautifully.  Should have started with the best in the first place!  This is a nutmeg grinder's dream!;Beauty and Function
17;6.0;3.0;17.0;Positives - This is a nifty grater for the first half of the whole nutmeg but fails when you get beyond halfway to grasp onto the nut and grind the last half.  I have lots of half shaved nuts in a jar waiting for another grater to come into my life!  It is easy to use once you get the nut properly seated in the chamber.  It grinds off nice small pieces or shavings from the nut, you keep your fingers away from any sharp areas and it is quick.  I store one nut in the chamber for instant use.\n\nNegatives - After only a few months of use I had a tooth break loose which has not so far reduced its ability to grind but if another one goes well it just might not work.  The teeth are not hardened steel but some other metal composite which is not as strong.  Loading and storage of extra nuts in the outside compartment is not practical because when opening the device all the stored nuts will fall out if you are not careful.  My advice is buy any one of a number of other nutmeg graters for less money, just watch your fingers when grating if using one of the microplanes and store your nuts in a glass jar with a lid.;Less than satisfied
4;7.0;3.0;5.0;Pros:\n+ Stores extra nutmeg nuts\n+ Free rotating turning knob\n+ Pretty straight forward to load\n+ Comfortable in hand to hold\n\nMeh:\n= Not great for large volume of ground nutmeg, but will work.\n\nCons:\n- Grind is not fine.\n- Turning knob is small\n\nNotes:\nThe grind  is not that fine which is ok in pies and cooked recipes.  For coffee or eggnog, you should find something with a finer grind.  Grinds standard sized nutmeg. Larger ones don't fit. Not a real issue.  If you need teaspoons of fresh ground nutmeg for pies, the handle is small, and useful for a few turns for drinks, but for volume you want a more substantial knob.  I wouldn't recommend this grinder for this use.;Ok, does the job.
5;8.0;3.0;8.0;The grinder seems to be working well up to this point however when we disassembled it to put in another nutmeg, we discovered that it only had two prongs to position the nutmeg.  It looks like it had 4.  No pieces were found in the grinder nor were we aware, thankfully, that we consumed any.  I emailed the manufacturer for their input but haven't received any response.  I can only surmise that manufacturer support is unfortunately nonexistent.  So far, the nutmeg doesn't seem to be slipping during the grinding process but having 2 if it is supposed to have 4 prongs to position the nutmeg leaves us in doubt as to it's lasting quality.  We've had the grinder for approximately 5 months.;Work well currently
8;9.0;5.0;7.0;I'm usually afraid to order something like this online but the reviews were all good so I went for it.  The mechanism in this grater is so smooth - I love to operate it!  I'm using more fresh nutmeg now and it makes a world of difference.  I also enjoy the fact that you can store a few fresh nutmeg right under the see thru cover so you always know how much you have.;Great grater

12;11.0;1.0;8.0;Bought with high hopes. Worked great at first with excellent shaves BUT soon the spring got weak and it quit working. Handle frequently came loose.\nToo great a price for a lemon.\nBought another acrylic from Amazon for about $19.00. It works just as well - so far it continues to shave the nut perfectly\nFinally found Peugeot home page. Emailed them to see if their life time warranty on the grinder was true. No response yet..;Weak spring
10;12.0;4.0;7.0;This little gadget will shave only one nutmeg at a time, though it will store plenty more, as you would see in the illustrations. It's a shaver, not a grinder,  but the shavings are so fine they may as well be grinds. If you use freshly ground nutmeg in any quantity, this little gadget will save you time and fingertips, but if you use only a slight dusting every now and then, I'd recommend a little grater.\n\nI do use this quite often and like its simplicity and style, though it was a bit of an extravagance.;Simple and effective
11;13.0;5.0;7.0;Este Nutmeg Grinder da Peugeot  simplesmente maravilhoso. Seu maquina  perfeita. Recomendo a todos. J tenho outros produtos da linha Peugeot e todos funcionam perfeitamente bem.;Excellent.
19;14.0;5.0;9.0;The mill is very easy to use, and gives even grindings of nutmeg. It is just the quality you would expect from Peugeot. I own the pepper and salt mill from Peugeot, and I am very pleased with them. Therefore buying the Peugeot nutmeg mill was not a difficult decision. This is the one. Even my 5 year old loves to use it to put some nutmeg over his mashed potatoes.;great quality
6;15.0;4.0;5.0;Works better than any other nutmeg grinder I've had but, coming from Peugeot, I expected all-metal works instead of cheap-looking plastic. I'm crossing my fingers the tongs that hold the pod in place don't break.;Great but should be better
7;16.0;5.0;5.0;One finger operation is all that is needed to produce a steady stream of nutmeg from this grinder.  Very sturdy and it should last a lifetime.;This is the best grinder
13;17.0;4.0;5.0;"So, you're looking for the reputed ""top"" nutmeg grinder around.  Perhaps you're considering the one that is/was carried at William-Sonoma, Sur La Table, etc. This is it.  Everyone who's a foodie has heard of Peugeot. Made in France, and all that.\n\nComes packed with the actual nuts pictured, and the fit is pretty tight with 5-6 of them in there.  Replacement nuts from a local source might not fit ""exactly"" inside the acrylic cover, just fyi.\n\nThe grind is between fine and medium, and is only slightly adjustable depending on how much you tighten the mechanism (too loose, though, and it won't grip the nut strongly enough to work).  The mechanism is nearly identical to the copy-cat version by William (WM) Bounds (see nut grinder) which also sells here for about 40% less.  That one is poorer mechanically (I own both), and produces much larger shavings.\n\nSpeaking of the mechanism, it isn't perfect, and sometimes a little creative positioning of the nut may be required to get it ""seated"" securely to the hooked shaft to get it going.  Although I have to admit to getting that nostalgic, holiday feeling when turning the grinder, I've had even better, more consistent results using a micro-plane for nuts (the small, narrow version).\n\nThis version is chrome.  There is also a wood based version, though not sure if Amazon still sells it.";This is the one...
14;18.0;4.0;5.0;This grinder is a great improvement from our last one, which had a spring loaded cover that was very difficult to secure so it kept popping off. This cover also has the same tendency to torque when grinding, but does tighten down much better than our last grinder.\nThe grinding mechanism is very smooth.;Smooth grinding

7;1.0;1.0;5.0;"Awful. Just awful. Albert Uderzo penned some decent Asterix adventures following the death of his long-time collaborator, Rene Goscinny, but the quality of his stories ultimately started to go into decline. This painful process hits rock bottom with this mess of an album.\n\nUderzo took the faintest inkling of an idea and stretched it out into 44 thinly-spread pages of nothing. Well, almost nothing; there's a perfunctory political allegory intermingled with Uderzo's reactionary attitudes towards manga, but it all amounts to very little. The emaciated story peters out around about page 35, floundering pathetically for the rest of the book.\n\nThis story had the potential to be a worthwhile inclusion to Asterix's fine legacy, in a ""that's crazy enough to work!"" sort of way. Unfortunately, it has become evident that Albert Uderzo ran out of ideas long ago.";The nadir of Asterix
2;2.0;3.0;25.0;"Spaceships, super clones, a nice tellytubby looking space alien and a bad grasshopper looking space alien, and above all a mediocre story line. What is next? Asterix and Obelix travel in time to New York, or Roman Soldiers in Space? This was not a typical Asterix. Old Asterix lovers like me and the previous reviewers will not enjoy this one. People new to Asterix and Obelix should not buy it either, since this is not what Asterix is about.\n\nOn the other hand, I asked my nine year old what he thought of it. He liked the fact that Uderzo introduced some space ships and aliens into the story. He thought it was ""different, and creative"". He liked it as much as he liked all the other ones. He has already read it several times.\n\nThinking about it, he actually has a point. Children see it differently, many of them like this stuff. Monsters, science fiction, fighting clones, if you were nine years old maybe you would like it too. So to give the new generation a voice I gave it three stars. In the end I don't regret buying it.";Asterix of the future?
3;3.0;1.0;22.0;"I agree with everything written by previews reviewers. This is the worst Asterix book by far. I know it's the only one I will never have a desire to read again. The story is ... well, there really isn't much of a story here. Asterix and the villagers are secondary characters at best -- just there in the background.\n\nIt's sad because the series is, without any exaggeration, the best ""children's"" book series ever. Even the books after Goscinny's death (post Asterix in Belgium) were fairly good and had some redeeming parts to them. This one, however, truly has no redeeming qualities. Uderzo is a wonderful cartoonist but Asterix has always been about much more than just pretty pictures.\n\nI'd say, do yourselves a favor and buy all the other Asterix books, particulary the ones written by Goscinny (and if you already have them, re-read them; I've re-read them a million times, they're that good). Take a pass on Asterix and the Falling Star; it'll just depress you.";The end of Asterix ...
1;4.0;1.0;19.0;"Rene Goscinny was the storyteller for the original Asterix series, while Albert Uderzo was the illustrator. Since Goscinny's demise, Uderzo has taken on both the tasks himself. Unfortunately, Uderzo's storytelling leaves much to be desired. The result is that in the latest installments of Asterix' adventures, including ""Asterix and the Falling Sky"", the illustrations are as good as they used to be, but the actual story has suffered heavily. The plots are nowhere close to what Goscinny could conjure up; most missed is the subtle, sly humor that made Asterix so enjoyable to me and my friends growing up.\n\nNevertheless, this is still Asterix, and I almost enjoyed reading the Falling Sky. It is actually better, in my opinion, than ""Asterix and the Secret Weapon"" - another all-Uderzo affair. Normally I would have given it 3 or 4 stars.\n\nHowever, I was dismayed by what I figured out to be thinly-veiled disparagement of certain ethnicities in the Falling Sky adventure. The bad alien in here has the complexion and facial features very similar to people from some Oriental ethnicities, and there is dialogue about how they are jealous of the good aliens (represented by popular Disney characters, with a name that is an anagram of ""Walt Disney"" .. you figure out which society is being referred to here), and how the bad aliens try to steal the ideas and technologies of the good aliens.\n\nNormally I don't read too much into such things, but taken together, this is impossible to ignore or wave off as mere coincidence (I am still hoping that I am wrong here). Racial/ethnic stereotyping is never acceptable, but when it creeps into an adventure of a much-beloved comic hero, especially when the adventure is written in the 21st century, it is simply reprehensible. I am deeply disappointed, and forced to give it a single star.";"Missing the wit and charm of the old Asterix series; instead, this one has racist undertones"
8;5.0;1.0;13.0;Since Goscinny's death the asterix stories have been on a slow decline. But this one is really really god awful.\nIn short 2 seperate alien races come to earth to attain the magic potion for themselves. Eventually they find out it won't work on their physiologies and they leave. Thats it.\nNone of the usual character interplay and in fact we hardly see any of the characters at all. I didn't even get most of the puns.\nMaybe Uderzo should just give it away.;please, no more
4;6.0;1.0;15.0;I have been a MASSIVE asterix fan since childhood. When I heard of a new book in the works I was excited by the prospect of another Asterix book. Perhaps the last too! I hoped that the new comic book would prove better than the last, Asterix and the Actress, a mediocre attempt to recycle some classic Asterix characters while adding an unnecessary family element to it. Judging by the cover of Falling Sky I anticipated it would be a really good read. I was so WRONG!\n\nFirst of all the main characters are just bystanders in the story, watching good Disney-like alien creatures battle bad Anime-style ones. There is no plot to the story. All this book does is reflect Albert Uderzo's animation prejudices and his obvious antagonism towards Japanimation.\n\nThis book does not compare to any of the Asterix classics that have brought joy to many. Books like Asterix and Cleopatra and Asterix and the Laurel Wreath are great in so many levels. Even some of Albert Uderzo's solo Asterix works, although not as good as the ones done with Goscinny, were really good.\n\nIf you are a newcomer to the world of Asterix, DO NOT start with this book, and if you're a lifelong fan like me, DO NOT ruin the image of Asterix by reading this!;SORELY DISAPPOINTED!
9;7.0;1.0;11.0;"Aliens visit the little Gaulish village we know so well - ? - HUH? - Aliens? What's wrong with the Romans? The classical jokes, the motifs that make reading Asterix magic, the way it works at multiple levels so I enjoy it on one level, my 9yo on another and my 6yo on yet another? All missing.\n\nThis book lacks the character, wit, humour and charm of the earlier books. It is completely out of character with them, and I'm really disappointed to see a great series stoop to this level. Even my children say they don't like it.\n\nThe icing on the cake is that the pages are falling out of my copy after only a few days. Normally I'd exchange the book and get another one, but this one can just go straight to the recycling.\n\nAt the end, the alien ""fixes it"", to quote, ""for the Gauls to remember nothing about me, thus obliterating all traces of this grotesque adventure!"". I wish, I wish...";If you love Asterix - don't read this
6;8.0;1.0;8.0;I have one simple advice for You: DO NOT BUY. I'm wrecking my brain, but I can't even begin to imagine why Albert Uderzo put THIS on the market. I was utterly disappointed.\n\nAsterix fighting aliens? ALIENS? AND CLONED SUPERMEN? Oh, come on. This is ridiculous...\n\nYou want Asterix? Fine. Go ahead and read one of his classic adventures. You are interested in European comics? Great! Buy Tintin. Enjoy Lucky Luke. Have fun with the Smurfs. Look for a copy of Karl -- but stay away from the falling sky. It seems to have fallen right on its creator's head...\n\nIt's like I wrote in my review for the original French edition of this latest installment in the Asterix series: This is no longer the Asterix we have come to known over the past few decades. This is something... weired!;Asterix? No, it is not...
0;9.0;1.0;6.0;"I was surprised when I finished reading this book and I asked myself ""is this the end of the series?"". This book completely lacked the story and the humor and wit associated with other Asterix series. A. Udeerzo tried something new with mix of flying saucers and UFO's, robots, super clones which can fly, galactic council similiar to ones in Star Wars and all important the magic potion of the Gauls but to the dismay did not make a good story. It looked like everytihing 'just fell out of the book'.";This book is not sky high
5;10.0;1.0;6.0;Having grown up with Asterix , I must agree with the other reviewers that Asterix and the Falling Sky is an abysmal offering. It is nothing like the Asterix we have grown up with and loved through the years.\nIt has no story , no historic or classic allusions that characterize Asterix albums , no real wit , and full of things that are out of place in Asterix.\nA few years ago , while reviewing Asterix and Obelix All at Sea , I wrote that the time was coming for Uderzo to lay down his pen. This one proves me right , even though Uderzo had produced some excellent Asterix albums on his own such as Asterix and the Black Gold and Asterix and the Flying Carpet.\nI simply cannot see anything worthwhile in the Falling Sky.;Who wrote this?

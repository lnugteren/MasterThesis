2;1.0;5.0;1223.0;I received this last week and have completed all of the workouts.  Some critism of two DVD's from another reviewing is noted and while it could have fit on one DVD, how can he charge so much for one, so he put it on two.  Bad move, but he's making money.  Speaking of which, the price is hefty, but WELL WORTH IT.  Yes he stands around and talks, because HE IS YOUR PERSONAL TRAINER with this.  Individual training sessions in a gym can cost up to $80/hour.  He walks you through and explains the moves instead of doing them so you know you are doing them right.  He's fit as can be and focuses his attention on you so you can get the same results.\n\nThe enclosed workout schedule offers a mix and match approach from one to three routines matched up daily over 4 weeks with one day off a week.  10 min a day for min results, 2 routines (20 min) for improved results, and 3 routines (30 min) for max results.  Bands are optional but included.  My doors are old and so I use weights and or omit the bands.  This system is perfect for me.  I also have his p90x and love it as well, but sometimes don't have the time to do it.\n\nYou can increase or decrease intensity based on your needs and that's why I like it.  For total or lower body, my strength, I push it.  For upper body and abs, my weakness, I rest and use his modified moves that he shows you, and I can still feel it.  YOU CAN GROW WITH THIS PROGRAM and that's why it's pretty cool.  Busy, one 10 minute workout and you'll feel it.  More time, then do two or three.\n\nAs usual for most every workout, the warm up and cool down are short, so I always do it twice or just keep going on my own.  Also, his Yoga is a combo of simple yoga for stretching and can be done daily as it really improves flexibility.  I can't believe I wrote this much about the program after one week, but it got me off my butt and working out again after I moved and have not worked out in about three months.  A+ Tony...and THANKS!;Simple and EFFECTIVE
67;2.0;4.0;843.0;"I bought this package a little over two months ago and finally decided to write up a review for it. Just a little background about myself. I did exercise on P90x for about a year, about three times a week in the past. However, after recovering from surgery a few months ago, I've stopped exercising but decided to get back in shape. P90x was good, but a bit too hardcore for my body at that time, hence I decided to give TMT (ten minute trainer) a try. My review and suggestions are based upon my own experience. It works for me, but may not work for you, but I hope you find it somewhat helpful.\n\nFirst, I suggest you set a goal, and see if you have to lose weight, and how much you need to lose by either talking to your doctor, or calculate your BMI (google it) index. BMI is not 100% accurate of telling how much weight you need to maintain to stay healthy, but would give you a good overall picture of what needs to be done. Again, use it as a general guidance of what your weight goal SHOULD be.\n\nNow, the title of the product is TMT, or Ten Minute Training. It's not exactly 10 minutes is all you need to invest per day. You need to include warm-up, and cool-down along with the 10 minute exercising. So, the whole package is roughly 30 minutes per round. I call this ""per round"" is just because that would only give you the minimum result. In order to get the maximum result, you need to do three rounds a day, with a mix of different exercise routines. For example, for one day, your ""package"" might include Total Body, Abs, and Yoga Flex. You can do the minimum of Total Body, but considering how much can you achieve in 10 minutes, would not be much. Some of the exercises are a bit chanlleging to some new joiners especially if you haven't done any routine exercise for a while, so you MUST let you body adjust to it first. What that means is, you probably want to stay off by doing one routine at the beginning, for about a week or even two weeks. If you keep the consistency, I guarantee your body will start to adjust to it, then perhaps you can do TWO routines per day. You can either do it one in the morning and one at night. Doing two routines at the same time may not be a great idea at the beginning especially some requires a high bit of cardio exercise. The whole idea is, don't push yourself too hard at the beginning, your body is NOT a robot and need time to adjust to the workout system. For me, after 6 weeks of the program, I do one cardio in the morning (boy, that feels good after all the sweating), and two routines (usually a Yoga, Abs, or something else) at night. Doing cardio in the morning will keep yourself really energetic throughout the day. You might feel a bit sore and tired at the beginning, but you will quickly adjust to it.\n\nIt's important to set a workout goal. Let's say, make a commitment to let your body burn in the first two weeks but only limited to doing only one routine a day, but on the 3rd or 4th week, you need to increase one more routine (that makes two routines per day then eventually three a day). No matter what, don't give yourself any excuse, don't delay, don't slack off. You WILL feel the difference. Finally, when you do three routines, you are not far from your goal, to reduce weight, feel MUCH healthier, and feel great after all. Your friends and family will notice too. If there are certainly day (not days in a row!) that you don't feel like working out or just totally burned out from work, skip it, but do watch the video anyway. This way, your mind-set is still exercising and not letting this commitment fall behind your head gradually.\n\nAside from exercising, there are some keypoints that should go hand in hand with the program. Here are what I can think of:\n\nWhen to do your routine:\n\nMorning: After you wake up, sip a little of water. Do a cardio, then move on with your daily activities. Drink another glass or two of water after the exercise. It's important to keep yourself hydrated. It's important NOT to drink iced or cold water. Luke warm water is the best since it can quickly hydrate your body system and cause less shock to your internal organs.\n\nEvening: Roughly one hour after dinner. Do a mix of other routines other than Cardio. Again, keeping yourself hydrated is important. Your muscle will need it too. No iced water, no soda (taboo), no energy drinks need, just good old water. That's all you need. You might feel a little hungry after workout, it's perfectly to have a serving of food, such as an apple, berries, but please, no pasta or anything that has much carbs. That will totally defeat the purpose of the program.\n\nWater: I can't stress it enough, that it's important to keep your hydrated all the time, especially after the workout. You should drink water whenever possible and don't wait until you get thirsty. Water also helps you get rid off the junks from your body. It will flush away the bad stuff from sweat, urine, and poop too.\n\nSleep: Try to get at least 8 hours of sleep, and get up early! 7 to 8 hours would be ideal.\n\nDiet: No more junk food. I know it's hard but the more processed food you consume, the more negativity you'll bring to your body, and negate the purpose of the TMT or any workout. I found anything that contains sugar, MSG, and saturated fat are extremely bad for our diet. If you have to buy processed food, be sure to check the label and see how much sugar, salt, and carbs they contain. Remember, you are what you eat!\n\nRecommended daily diet:\n1. Whole apple - one to two a day. It's a GREAT snack to eat after exercising\n2. Green tea - Always get the powder, NOT the one with leafs. Mix green tea powder with luke warm water so you won't destroy the nutrients within. Green tea is a great drink to help get rid of the body junks and contains a lot of vitamins. If you used to have energy drink, consider switching to green tea. It's cheap and easy to make, why not?! You can get green tea powder in most Japanese and Chinese supermarkets. Look at the label of production country. Japan makes the best green tea powder, Taiwan is the second, and stay away from other countries' production.\n3. Try to stay away from starchy food, such as pasta, rice and white bread. Those things contains lots of sugar and carbs which of course, negate or slow down your TMT efforts.\n4. Eat less meat, especially red meat. Try to substitute poultry with fish. Fish oil is good, Salmon is the best.\n5. Don't need to waste your money on organic food. Most so-called ""organic food"" you get from the supermarket are hardly organic wholly. Besides, organic food are only good when they are first picked and eaten within the first couple of hours. If you want true organic food, grow your own!\n6. Breakfast is important, whereas dinner is the least important (in my opinion, of course). For breakfast, have some oatmeal which is contains much fiber and vitamin, and can curb your hunger for many hours. Be sure to buy the kind you need to cook, not instant. Eat a relatively heavier lunch rather than dinner, as you still have to do much physical activities during the day\n\nOkay, here's the summary for the TMT:\n\nGood: A bit challenging at the beginning, but not too hard overall. I'm a 46-year old and have absolutely no problem catching up after the initial two-weeks burn-in period. Tony is a good trainer and gives you a lot of good advice during the routines. The two-set DVDs include Total Body, Lower Body, Abs, Yoga Flex, and Cardio, and the package even comes with the elastic band! It's a good value.\n\nBad: Annoying commercials. It pops out before and after every workout, but you can fast foward or skip them. Also, not sure why they can't put all workouts into one DVD. I have to keep on switch DVDs which is a pain, unless you have more than one DVD player. These are the major reaons I didn't give it a 5 star.\n\nWell, that's about it. I hope my lenghty, nagging review would be helpful to some of you. If you like my review, please rate it. If not, don't say anything (just kidding). Send me any questions or comments. I welcome them all. I might add more comments and edit this review from time to time.";Good as it claims, in most parts - Detail Review
125;3.0;3.0;994.0;I have been regularly exercising for over 30 years. I must say that Horton's workouts are not for beginners. You really have to know what you're doing, and how to modify the workouts for your particular body type, injuries, etc.\n\nAs a working mom, there are some days that I cannot get to the gym, or devote more than a half hour tops for working out. I bought this system to supplement my workout routine.\n\nIf I only have 10 minutes, I do the 10 minute cardio or the yoga flex or lower body. But 10 minutes is actually 12 or 13, as the clock stops between each move. It also takes a long time to switch back and forth between CDs, which is frustrating.\n\nIf I have 30 minutes or so, I do another Beach Body system, such as Yoga Booty Ballet or Kathy Smith. This is because I find their transitions and cueing to be much better, and not as rough on the body.\n\nFinally: while I enjoy the Beach Body programs, I do find their infomercials, which come at the end of each DVD, to be disruptive, loud, and annoying. If I have just completed a yoga workout, I don't want a screaming announcer to IMMEDIATELY come on and try to sell me something. This completely destroys the relaxation that I just worked so hard to achieve.;Good for 10 minutes
97;4.0;5.0;567.0;"Having been inactive for the best part of the last 4 years, I decided that it was time to get my behind moving again, and I bought this program.\nI really wanted to buy P90X, but being a former athlete, I knew that it would have been impossible to finish the 60-minutes + P90X workouts.\nIt is not a matter of time, it is a matter of knowing your body and how much you can do.\nThe TMT got me back into the game and had me moving again...\n\nFor those of you who are thinking of buying TMT, here are a few tips.\n1. Watch the videos first before you start the program. This will give you the opportunity to ""learn"" the exercises and try it at least once or twice.\n2. I confess that I could not finish the program the first time I popped it into my DVD. I did take short brakes. Do the same, but finish it. You will feel proud of yourself.\n3. You need to commit not only to the 10 minutes of physical exercise, but to 10 minutes of mental strength. Push yourself.\n\n10 minutes, 45 minutes, 2 hours, pick some product and go with it.\nI picked this one, because it is only 10 minutes (and I knew that in the beginning, that was all I could do).\nNow, I do 2 DVDs every time I exercise.\n\nWith proper nutrition (no junk food, that's really the only rule you should abide to), you will see results.\n\nGood luck";Great product - Not for absolute beginners
5;5.0;5.0;363.0;Tony Horton's 10 minute trainer is fabulous, and I must say this on behalf of myself and my husband (a person who absolutely DREADS working out in front of the TV).\n\nThis 10 minute trainer comes with 5 videos which last approximately 10 minutes in duration. I must let you know that if you plan to do the workout with the warm up (2 min) and cool down (2 min), your workout duration time will actually increase to 14 minutes per segment. The 5 workouts are cardio, total body, lower body, abs, and yoga flex.\n\nCardio- 10 minutes of agility drills, kicks, lunges, etc. (The program comes with resistance bands with a waist strap that you must attach to the door. It definitely increases resistance! You don't have to use it if you choose not to.)\n\nAbs- 10 minutes with 20 exercises lasting 30 seconds each- This is one tough ab workout. I would compare the level of challenge to Tamilee Webb's I want those abs workout (another tough ab workout)!\n\nTotal body- 10 minutes of challenging your whole body to a great workout\n\nLower body- 10 minutes that incoroporates some use of the resistance band to target those thighs and glutes\n\nYoga Flex- 10 minutes of yoga poses (Yogis out there might not like this segment since there is very little emphasis on breathing and centering your mind)\n\nI try to fit this in every evening in addition to my 30-60 minute workout I perform in the morning, and it is great. If my husband will do it without a fight, it is worth trying!;Phenomenal 10 minute workout!!!
129;6.0;3.0;6.0;"From what I can gather I think this is a more compact package than what you would get off the Beachbody website.  I get the impression that package you get there includes 2 DVD's.  There is only one in this kit.  I think you get the majority of the same items that you would there as well.  The advantage here being it is slightly smaller.\n\nI have only been using this DVD for a little over a week.  I am not completely new to working out as I have been going to the gym on my lunch breaks for nearly 9 years.  I admit I look forward to excuses to skive off working out, but I try to make it a priority as much as I can during the work week.  I know that I am more sore than I have been in a while.  I think I became complacent about my work out routine and I wanted a fresh approach.  I am only doing 10 minutes a day but I know that the lower body routine and especially the ab routine leave me just about as weak as a kitten.  So I am confident that if I keep up with it I will be stronger and better in shape.\n\nI read in another review where someone suggested to watch each of the routines straight through without actually performing them before trying attempting them.  I would also echo that sentiment.  I am often left trying to comprehend what I am being asked to do while 30 seconds or more has passed.  Because the routines are 10 minutes there is not a whole lot of time to devote to explaining the movements.  Tony tends to sprinkle hints throughout the minute or so you are engaged in doing it.  However, I think I would have benefited from a more in depth explanation or slower demonstration.  Once again I realize they are trying to compress as much as they can into a small space.  I believe I will be able to get better at each move as I practice them again and again.  The one exception though, for me, is the yoga flex routine.  There are some moves I have a hard time getting the ""full picture"" on.  Because I don't have someone walking around directing me or have others to observe and get multiple perspectives from I am a little lost.  Perhaps veteran yoga practitioners will find it simple.  I did not.\n\nThe last point I want to make is that probably around 15% of this DVD is ads for Shakeology.  I imagine that Beachbody Inc. is either affiliated with or holds interest in Shakeology.  Before the majority of workout routines and after many there is an ad talking about their shakes.  This is irritating to me.  I did not pay as much money as I did expecting to have a DVD full of advertising.";Challenging and likely worth the pain but a lot of money to be advertised to
93;7.0;5.0;253.0;"I could offer up a huge long list of exercise programs/weight-loss methods I've tried in my life and why they didin't work, but  I'll skip that and get to why I LOVE this program. First; it's so easy to get started. Don't get scared by all the reviews that state, ""not for beginners."" If I can do it, anyone can; you have to begin somewhere, right? I watched the Cardio and Total Body workouts before attempting them. I tried out various moves and experimented with the resistance band just to make sure I could do it all without injuring myself. I discovered that some moves had to be modified, and that on some arm exercises, I had to switch to light free weights. It wasn't a huge deal. Yes, the work-outs move quickly; if you only have 10 minutes to get a good sweat session in, you have to transition quickly. However, they stop the clock when they switch moves, so it's easy to hit the pause button if you find yourself begging for a breather. Start up again after a quick stretch and a drink of water. Tony's cheesy words of encouragement really do hold true; ""you do your best, and you forget the rest."" It's all you have to do. For the first week, I did only one workout a day, and I still saw results. Which brings me to the other thing I love, Love, LOVE about 10 minute trainer; you have options. You can literally be done in 10 minutes, but you don't have to be. Having downstairs neighbors, I can't do 1 hour workout videos that require a lot of jumping and running around. I'd be despised. But as it is, I only make them suffer 10-30 minutes a day, and they can live with that.  With 5 different videos (plus the bonus Power90), I don't have to do the same thing every day. I get to switch it up; it keeps me from tiring of the program, and keeps my muscles and joints happy.\nThe thing I love most about this program is that it works. Because it's so fast and easy and far from mundane, you keep going past the first week. Then when you measure at 2 weeks and realize you've lost 6 inches, you decide you really love the work out and want to keep going. When you measure after 3 weeks and see 11 inches gone, you jump for joy at the opportunity to do your work outs every day. When you realize you can actually do push-ups from plank rather than off your knees like you've been doing your whole life, you feel like building a shrine to Tony Horton in your closet.\nI haven't reached my 30 day mark, and I can already fit--almost comfortably--into my 60-day Goal Jeans (I imagine if I'd actually done the 10 day jean plan thingy that comes with the work-out, I would have seen faster results; oh well).\nI definetly plan to keep working hard and losing inches with 10 Minute Trainer. It's absolutely the smartest purchase I've ever made.";An effective workout you won't get bored with.
90;8.0;1.0;197.0;When you strip out all the fluff (printed material, etc), this package comes down to 50 minutes of workout video plus a single resistance band for $90+. To get to every video (everyday, every time you workout) you have to watch an add for Tony's web site. This is a lot more about selling you more Tony Horton products than providing you with the work outs promised. This product is way overpriced.;Overpriced, no substance. Where's the beef?
3;9.0;4.0;171.0;This 10 Minute Trainer will make you sweat, and you will feel the workout the next day.  The only downside and the reason for 4 stars is the fact that you should be given time to switch from one move to the other.  Once one minute is up the girl has started into the next, not giving you time to recover or get into the next position.  Everyone isn't advanced and can't move as quickly between moves.  Other then that it's a great workout DVD.;"""You Do Sweat"""
120;10.0;3.0;154.0;Great workout routine. However, when I am buying a product I don't want a continuous infomercial. I had to endure two or three minutes of talk or product information during each routine. If I am going to work out for 10 minutes, the last thing I want is somone talking for part of that time. It would be ok if he had a separate dvd for his other products but I don't want them on the dvd I paid for.;too many ads and talk
128;11.0;5.0;141.0;Wow!!  My husband and I absolutely LOVE the 10-minute trainer!!!  P90X takes just too much time---and is just TOO hard!  Tae Bo, a long time favorite, takes too much energy and time from our busy days too.  So---from the first infomercial for 10-Minute Trainer I was totally sold!!  The workouts are short---but very sweet!  Sore, but not so bad that a workout every day is impossible like with Tae Bo and P90X.  We started with the 1 workout a day the first month and now try to do 2 a day, maybe the 3---but really, just the ONE 10-minute workout a day is great.  We do also walk our dog every day----so get plenty of daily cardio.  I HIGHLY recommend the 10-minute trainer to ANY busy person-----we have a home-based business, homeschool 2 very active teenagers and are kept busy with many other things.  Working out is great if it does not sap the energy for daily living----and this is why we absolutely LOVE the 10-minute trainer!  Tony Horton's personality really grates at me----but I love his workouts.  I also love all the products that Beachbody.com sells----they have programs for every person---not just 20-somethings with oodles of energy and time for a long and hard daily workout----which I actually had the time and energy for when I was 20-something!  My proof that just 10 minutes a day works-----shrinking while I GAIN weight aka muscle mass---and actually MORE energy!  Cool!;LOVE, love, LOVE this system!!
126;12.0;3.0;124.0;This really looked good and fairly simple on all the infomercials, but if you live in a small space, without hard floors, it's very difficult.  Trying to do the slides, small hops, etc. on carpet wasn't easy.  And if you have any kind of back problems, then forget it!  A lot of sit-ups, push-ups, lunges, etc. needed.  Although I think this would be very effective, I'm unable to do it.  I was very disappointed.;Looked great on TV, but........
124;13.0;3.0;122.0;I have recently purchased this exercise system upon my teenage son's request.  I am a physical therapist, Pilates instructor and author of 2 exercise books.  This system is NOT for the beginner. I am fit and teach several classes a week and this system was challenging even for me. I found the exercises are done too quickly  with no time to focus on technique or safety. If you are not starring at the  TV screen you cannot follow this exercise program.  The cuing is not what I would consider well done.\nTony Horton is a great trainer for the elite athlete but not for the home exerciser. Plus for the price- here is what you actually get--several handouts, 2 DVD's and a band. That's it.\nSave your money and go to a trainer for a private session to set up your own program and buy a band at the fitness store.;Donna-Physical Therapist
61;14.0;1.0;87.0;I'm an avid fan of Tony Horton's P90x CD program.  But sometimes I don't have an hour plus to do the workouts so I thought I'd try this on to fill in on those days.  I am seriously disappointed.  My biggest complaint is that they don't explain that the resistance bands need to be attached to a center door hinge.  Not one door in my house has a center door hinge.  He says you can do the 10 minute workouts without the bands.  But I feel that you really don't get much of a workout in 10 minutes with no resistance.  and for $90!!  Don't buy it.;do not buy it!
4;15.0;4.0;108.0;Well, I have had the 10 minute trainer for a couple of weeks, and it is not a bad system. I really wish that they would have put all of the workouts on one dvd instead of two. It makes it really annoying to have to stop my workout, change dvds, and then wait for the dvd to load to continue working out.\nI have done pretty much all of the workouts except for the yoga one. The total body and the cardio ones are great. The abs one will leave you with a sore, but well worked out core. The lower body was a bit disappointing since it was a 'squats-r-us' type of workout. I would recommend for ladies that they purchase a lighter version of the band because the red band that comes with the kit is really difficult to work with.\nFor a Tony Horton workout, it was good compared to Power 90. However, like the workouts I have done with him, his co-stars end up doing 90% of the workout while he just stands there, talks, and makes bad jokes.;Good for those short on time
43;16.0;5.0;62.0;"I ordered Tony Horton's 10 minute trainer almost a year ago after seeing an infomercial on TV. I had been looking to get back into shape but was worried about time. The ""10 minute"" idea sounded really interesting to me. I ordered it and decided to follow the program and see what happened.\n\nI should say that the workout calender really calls for 3 - 10 minute workouts a day to be most effective and there is also short warm up and cool downs so it's not exactly 10 minutes but it's close. I decided to follow the calender and do the 3 workouts a day, exactly how it said. So technically I was doing about 30-35 mins of workout most days.\n\nWith that said I did see incredible results! Between day 10 and 14 I noticed my pants started feeling a little loose around my waist and that did it for me. That was the moment that I realized that it was working and motivated me to keep going. I was only 15-20 lbs over weight at the time but I wanted to change. I was losing 1-2 lbs a week doing this program. Obviously eating right is very very important as well. You don't have to eat perfect but you need to clean your diet up and make healthier choices.\n\nTrust me though, when you start seeing results, you won't have the cravings to eat that junk anymore! I have moved on to more extreme workouts now but I can credit this program to getting me back into working out and on a healthier path! Highly recommend!";Very effective for those short on time!
101;17.0;1.0;66.0;"Did not include Resistance bands and ""other extras"" as stated. Just the dvd with 5 workouts. Had to order the bands separately.\nPostage was not paid.";Description misleading
44;18.0;1.0;54.0;Warning!  Do not buy!!!!!  For your $90 you get 4 different 10 minute work outs!!! That is it!  And.........you also are the lucky recipient of more advertising than workouts!  Plus, you find out that 10 minutes is not really going to get you good results!  Noooooooooo!  You really need to do 3 workouts together!  The most misleading program ever!;RIP OFF! RIP OFF!
76;19.0;4.0;58.0;As a working mom of a busy toddler, most of my spare time is spent agonizing over cloth vs. disposable, and the finer culinary points of hot dogs.  There is little time for a solid workout.  10 minute trainer is the solution to flabby arms, the spare tire, and the continuous mommy butt that extends from your mid thighs to the small or your back.\n\nThis workout is not for the weak.  Before childbirth (BC), I was a runner, logging over 30 miles a week.  I don't look like the after shots, but I'm in reasonably good shape. This workout kicks my butt.  I feel like I've worked out when I'm finished, and I sweat like a 300 pound construction worker on a summer day in Miami.  If you're new to working out, you may only be able to do one workout at a time.  Don't get discouraged. You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll adjust.\n\nThe bands are a must.  If you outgrow you first band, never fear - the stiffer band will kick your butt again.  I'm not a huge fan of the door thing, since I don't have a door to use it on, but it does work.\n\nThis isn't exactly a weight loss product unless you follow the meal guide, but it's an amazing fitness product.  The meal guide is good if you think the food pyramid includes a Quarter Pounder with Cheese, but if that's your MO, there are plenty of other cookbooks and diet plans on the market that will give you better options for low calorie meals.  We get it Beachbody - a banana is low fat and celery nets negative calories.\n\nOverall, I'm loving the workout.  And honestly, I have a crush on Tony, too.  Overall, it's better than $70 a month at my local Y working out next to spandex guy, grunting girl and the 80 lb 16 year old texting on the elliptical.;Great Workout for those Short on Time
6;20.0;5.0;72.0;I received Tony Horton's 10 Minute Trainer by Beachbody yesterday and did the Cardio and Total Body.  I was very pleased with both.  With the Cardio the lady doing the exercises with Tony was using the waistband with the resistant cord attached to the door.  Although I did not use the cord I still got a very good workout.  I would definitely recommend this.  I feel that if you are short on time and want a good workout, do this.  Or if you are not short on time and want to do them all together that will work.;Nice
84;21.0;2.0;56.0;I just wanted to warn you all...if you purchase this item though beachbody and try to return it you MUST send it with a tracking number, keep it, and then call them before they will refund the money. They do not do this automatically and will not tell you.;Just a warning...
57;22.0;1.0;49.0;The so called program comes with ONLY two DVDs....while the picture shows FIVE....I am not used to this type of deception on Amazon. What I see on their site is what I get in the mail. Not this one though. I am so disappointed. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;Don't be deceived
127;23.0;4.0;64.0;Great program. Gets you up and moving quickly but sometimes a little too fast!  He doesn't take the time to explain or properly show or demonstrate the moves before doing them so the first few times of watching and working out to the videos were a bit difficult but it gets easier and you can catch on in a fairly quick manner. I do suggest only viewing the program first before popping the disc in and getting started right away.;Good but Fast Moving
106;24.0;5.0;53.0;I really enjoy these workouts. They're no nonsense yet fun and they do a great job of getting you fit in a short time. You do ten exercises for one minute each. Simple and smart. Many of the exercises require resistance bands.\n\nResistance bands are really a superior way to workout. Why? Simply put, you get tension in both the push and the pull of a movement if done right. With free weights, that's not the case. Moreover, the body doesn't know if you're using free weights of steel or resistance of rubber. It only knows you're giving it a good workout and it responds accordingly.\n\nHorton does a commendable job of taking you through each program. And the trainer tracks are quite helpful as they give you instructions on how to do certain exercises correctly. I find the DVDs well put together and easy to navigate, which I much appreciate.\n\nThese are not sissy workouts. I've worked out for decades. I've lifted heavy weights and done it all. I'm quite impressed with this program and really enjoy it. I like to mix things up and not let my body get too used to any workout program. So I use these several times a week and then change off to something else. In other words, I don't follow the program as laid out. But if a person wanted to follow the program, I'm reasonably sure they would get great results.\n\nIf you feel ten minutes is not enough for you, all you have to do is add another segment. It's your call. The program is based on doing two per day with one day off.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\n- Susanna K. Hutcheson;Excellent & effective workouts that really work
39;25.0;4.0;35.0;"I bought the 10 minute workout simply because I knew there was no way I could do anything nearly approaching P99X or any of the other programs after I had an accidentai ""come to Jesus meeting"" in a three-wall-mirrored dressing room this past Christmas at a local Macy's department store while trying on a shirt.  Although I had lost 30 pounds last year to say the least I was not impressed by the front, side and especially back views of my shirtless body.  Simply put I needed work if I ever planned on taking my shirt off in public again.  I began the program on Jan. 3rd, '13 and have so far lost 14 pounds.  This program will work, but like AA you've got to work the program and watch your diet.  If you do the exercises you WILL begin to see your body change.  They are not easy at all and the first couple of weeks is brutal with the yoga and especially the abs trainer.  I would recommend this 10 minute trainer highly only if you have the dedicated will power to do it EVERY day no matter what.  I've slowly gotten in better shape and am now doing two of the suggested three daily 10 minute workouts.  I might add as a bonus I have strengthened my core and ab muscles and stretched and turned my body to the point that a near crippling case of spinal stenosis I've had for the past three years is becoming a minor nuisance instead of a major problem as I was literally on the verge of spinal fusion and figured this program was about $95,000 cheaper and gave it a chance.  Don't waste your time if you are not going to take it seriously.  You can still get plenty of exercise bike riding, running or even walking, but if you TRULY want to get back in those old ""skinny"" clothes again and regain twice as much energy as you've had in years I 100 percent say go for it.  You won't be disappointed unless you quit.";It's worth the money if you invest the time
88;26.0;2.0;41.0;"Not thrilled with this product.  Think it's WAY overpriced, and not all the exercises are doable by the ""home-body"" type person. Also, it says 10 minutes, but to get results you have to do a ""combination"" of several of the exercises, making it more like 30 to 50 minutes. Exercise band that came with it is cheap product.  Not happy with this purchase or how much I spent on it.";Same Exercise Fad
58;27.0;5.0;37.0;"I used to be in decent shape, and once laughed at these workout videos. But now that I'm nearing my mid-50s, and the joints and muscles don't cooperate like they used to, and I started feeling winded at the mildest exertion, and the weight, cholesterol, and blood pressure kept rising, it was time to do something.  Besides the fact that I don't have much free time, I knew I probably wouldn't stick with a long and painful workout routine.  When I saw this on TV, I said, ""Ten minutes?  Yeah, I can handle 10 minutes.""\n\nPricey?  Yes.  Are the workouts really longer than 10 minutes?  A little.  But is it worth the money?  YES!  I'm ashamed to admit it, but I thought the 2-minute warm-up was going to kill me the first time I worked out.  During the first workouts, I had to take some breathers and modify a couple of workout positions, but it was all over in 10 minutes (or so.)  And the next time I was able to do more.  Now, after about 3 weeks, I can go through almost all of the routines.  A couple of the abs exercises I will probably never be able to do like the young model does, but I can do the modified exercises and I don't stop.  In short, I feel better, I've lost weight, I've lost inches off my waist, my endurance and flexibility are much improved, and even my arms are regaining some tone.  I'm also eating less junk food and more good food, and that's just come about mostly because I'm not bored sitting on my butt.\n\nI don't use the yoga exercise.  I do the Abs and the Cardio on the same day, and then I do the Full Body the next day and the Lower Body the following day.  Days off only when the schedule doesn't permit a workout.  I supplement the Full Body workout with 2 sets of 15 reps each of dumbbell presses, tricep extensions, dumbbell curls, and overhead tricep presses, which I knock out in just a couple of more minutes.  That's it.  I can knock this out when I get home from work during the week, and still have dinner nearly ready by the time the wife gets home.\n\nSo you can believe the complainers and do nothing, or you can get off your butt and do something constructive.  Maybe a longer, more intense workout program is in the cards for later, but the Ten Minute Trainer is the perfect kick-start to get you going.";When You've Hit Rock Bottom....

They could easily fit all the different workout videos into one DVD but then it  wouldn't appeared like you get your money's worth...paying $90 for one DVD?  The band that comes with it, you can easily get it for $7 at walmart.  The plan does work but don't expect instant miracle.  The packaging of the program is all smokes and mirrors.

122;32.0;2.0;42.0;While I think this DVD will be good exercise, it is not nearly as easy as it appeared on the infomercials.  The 1st exercise they show is a pushup, which is not easy for everyone to do.  They never actually show you how to do the exercise, the women simply start doing them and you have to try and follow and keep up when they switch to the next one.  I am going to give it a try, but have felt a LOT of frustration in my beginning phases of this workout.  I keep telling myself that eventually I will know how to do the exercises and it will work.;It looks easier on TV
103;33.0;5.0;36.0;I would definately recommend this product to everyone. My husband does the P90X program and it did wonders for him, so I tried the 10 minute trainer. I did 2 videos a day for 6 days a week and with in a few weeks i could see a definate change in my physical appearance. I love it.;Love it
77;34.0;4.0;33.0;"I purchased Tony Horton's P90X workout early this year.  I must first add that any video workout purchase I make is to SUPPLEMENT an outdoor excercise routine and not be my exclusive routine.  P90X was purchased as a solution to what I refer to as the ""Winter Squeeze"" - that dreary period where I get up in the dark and return home from work in the dark.  With my busy work schedule and 80-mile-per-day commute, finding an hour per day six days per week for P90X was difficult. I was able to hold it together fairly well for two months, but by the time I faced the third month, it was just too much.\n\nEnter 10-Minute Trainer.\n\nAt first I was skepitcal, but I figured I'd give it a shot.  I felt tight and ""worked"" after just the first day.  I am already seeing and feeling results and have been using the workouts as a supplement to swimming.  I am a certified fan of this hard-to-believe but effective routine.\n\nMy only complaint:  The P90X videos were done in a much higher quality fashion (granted, they were pricier too), with the workouts done by people who looked truly real and athletic. The 10-Minute Trainer's presentation is sort of ""fluffy"" for me, and the woman who is in a considerable number of the routines is too Barbie-like to appeal to me. I'm sure she's nice person, but it was all a bit too girly for me.\n\nHowever, what the routines lack in presentation they make up for in results, and I have certainly not been disappointed in the latter.  I highly recommend this routine for busy professionals trying to find a way to balance the myriad demands of life!";Lifesaver
72;35.0;4.0;31.0;"To start, I got this program to get in shape and not to lose weight.  I lost the extra 20 lbs. I was carrying through diet and a jogging/pushup regiment that I did every day for about 2 months.\n\nTo get in shape, if you haven't done any kind of strenuous cardio for awhile, this can be a good stepping stone.  The 10 minute workouts will get your heart-rate up and they will make you sweat.  However, like some reviewers have mentioned, not all the exercises are beginner friendly.  The Ab routine was particularly difficult because it includes a lot of planking moves that require good balance and strong upper and lower body support just to maintain before you even do the exercise.  In a lot of cases, however, they demonstrate a modified version of the move that will make it easier.\n\nMy advice to people is to do what Tony says, ""Do your best, and forget the rest.""  If you can't keep up with Tony and the fitness models then don't.  Go at your own pace but make sure you keep moving.  I just finished my third week, I'm not overweight, and I still have to stop and take breaks from time to time.  I usually jog in place or do an oversimplified version of the move until I build up steam again.\n\nMy biggest complaint is the focus on lower body exercises.  If you suck at lunges and squats like me then you will dread any day that includes the lower body video.  This is because if you're also doing a set of Cardio or Core Cardio, these routines also have a lot of hopping and lunging that is difficult when your legs are already fried.  I hate it, but it is getting results.\n\nAlso, the 10-minute title is misleading, as others have said.  While 10-minutes is great if it's all the time you have, you need to do at least 2 routines a day to get any fast results.  The program recommends 3 a day if you can manage it.\n\nI will say that I like the program overall and I am seeing definite results after doing 2-a-days for the last 3 weeks.  However, it is getting repetitive and I would recommend splitting the cost with a friend or loved one, as the price is a bit steep for what you get.";Title is misleading but it will give you results
110;36.0;1.0;35.0;This is not a good system.  i did the workouts once and then returned it.  Tony is annoying and so are the women doing the exercises.  It was just all bad!!  Don't waste your money.  If you want a good workout look at Kathy Smith or Jillian Michaels DVD's.;Very disappointing
81;37.0;3.0;30.0;The production of the 10 Minute Trainer seems rather low budget, and Tony Horton is annoying. The workouts are just ok. The transitions between exercises can be cumbersome. The lower body workout is my favourite - lots of squats. The best thing about the 10 Minute Trainer is the countdown clock on the screen. They stop the clock during the transitions which is great.  If I could do it over I would buy a single DVD if possible to try it out before sinking $90 into the whole program.;a bit amatuerish
35;38.0;2.0;25.0;"First, note that the description on Amazon is both misleading and contradictory.\n\nThe top photo clearly shows FIVE DVDs, while a subsequent photo shows TWO DVDs. Guess which you get? That's right -- just the two DVDs.\n\nAnd the second photo with the two DVDs? Notice the ""Lean Jean"" item towards the bottom center, and the accompanying text that describes a ""10-Day lean jean plan."" Bzzzt. The top photo, with the (incorrect) five DVDs, shows a 2-Day ""Jump Start"" plan, which is also noted in the very last line under the Product Description? That's what you get instead. And what is this bonus 2-Day jump start? More upselling. It's not a feature -- it's an ad.\n\nAnd speaking of ads, there's no shortage of them. Two other sheets in the box advertise more products. And even on the DVD, after the very first video, there it is again -- another ad for a totally different workout promising the ""fastest results possible""! What is with these people?! I'll be darned if I'll buy another Beachbody product!\n\nThe DVDs themselves have pretty crummy production values. I strongly recommend watching and listening to the ""trainer track"" before doing anything. Not only does Tony provide more explanation about what's going on and what to keep in mind, but the transitions are pretty quick so it's helpful to get an idea first of the planned workout. There is no ""here are the moves you'll be doing and the things to keep in mind for each."" Even on the trainer track, Tony talks like you've already done other workouts with him.\n\nThe bloody warm-up begins with them already in motion! What the heck?! And there's no ""switch to this in 3-2-1""; it's just switch and good luck following! You MIGHT be doing a move for all of three seconds before switching to another.\n\nI was doing fairly well with weight training and a personal trainer before I had to take off the past six months due to demands from work. I was unable to make it through the first workout (mostly resistance-band stuff) without taking a breather, but I'm still hoping I can grit my teeth thru the ads and get some benefit from the workouts since I still don't have enough time for the gym. We'll see.\n\nA much, MUCH better product is the Rushfit program from MMA champion Georges St-Pierre (also available on Amazon). No upselling, lots of explanation, and still allows for alternate moves to ease or increase the difficulty as needed. The only downside is that it takes more time, which was the real draw of the 10-minute trainer.\n\nBottom line: medium-hard, fast-paced workouts; no intro, and barely a ""here we go""; misleading/contradictory info on Amazon; and a boatload of upselling. If you have the time, go with Rushfit instead.";A LOT of upselling
98;39.0;2.0;31.0;I purchased this product from Media Mplace, my best friend purchased it from Beach Body. The items I recieved, even though they had been vaccum sealed in plastic, were clearly pirated. The cards and items were copies with badly pixelated colors that weren't accurate (Tony looked intensely orange), and the disks had been burned incorrectly, so they didn't even work right. The DVD menus were cheap and homemade - something you may not notice, if you don't work with making homemovie DVD's, as I do quite often. And, also, if you couldn't compare it to the actual product, which I was able to. It was a world of difference! I know you want to save money, but please just go buy the actual product. Media Mplace is very nice and polite, and refunded me when I asked, so I won't say anything negative about their customer service, but I just couldn't support piracy. It's wrong. Just order from BeachBody, be honest. The product is worth it, when you get the actual thing.;Not Official Items - Beware of Piracy!

62;41.0;4.0;27.0;"I'm a long-time fan of the P90X system. It is, simply put, the single greatest workout system - home or otherwise - ever created. In fact it is nearly perfect - except that there are no 10, 30, or 45 minute options for it - unless you want to repeatedly skip the second half all the time.\n\nThis video series partially corrects that by allowing for a customizable workout session consisting of a fast warmup, a quick cooldown, and your choice of several 10 minute workouts in between.\n\nAnd so, this is not a 10 minute workout. It is, at best, a 15-20 minute workout if you choose a single session, and a 25-35 minute workout if you choose one of the recommended combinations of 2-3 workouts (plus the warmup/cooldown)\n\nAnd it is RUSHED. It moves fast. In fact, there are fast-cuts in some places in order to trim seconds off the video where the model instantaneously changes poses.\n\nDo not expect to keep up the first day. Tony attempts, with varying success, to combine several exercises into a single move (such as the ""Warrior Lunge""). Doing this successfully requires good mental and physical discipline, and good balance - but it is a time saver if you can make the mental commitment.\n\nIf you have the time for a LONG workout, even three days a week, buy P90X. You cannot beat this system.\nIf you have time for a medium-length workout, 5-7 days a week, try P90 (original)\nIf you ABSOLUTELY MUST workout less than 20 minutes, this is the 10 minute trainer ""for the BUSIEST"" people.\n\nNot for the laziest, or the least motivated, but for people who are SERIOUSLY busy and are have the discipline to get the MOST out of a 15-20 minute workout in order to save 30-45 minutes.\n\nIf you would like a more relaxing 10-minute series with a reasonable amount of variety, I recommend the Yoga 10 minute solution, or one of it's family videos. It's a better workout for people who want to maintain health and flexibility without the hardcore style of Tony Horton.\n\nAbout the production quality - More modern than P90, less sophisticated than P90X, the production quality is strange and mixed, as if it were produced as a home video with professional camera work. The cuts are very rough. Tony often loses track of the camera and is looking around as if lost. Tony spends a good part of the time narrating and commenting on the model's form (which is fine and appropriate for his role as a trainer, not as a fitness model, and the fact that so much content must be packed into a very tight space). The video is shot in some sort of fitness studio with a large, unmarked steel door and a glass window which contains what looks like it might be part of a logo.\n\nP90X, by contrast, has the appearance of being completed in a single take. The camera transitions are excellent, and Tony is always on spot. The music complements the workouts, Tony does most of the workouts most of the time, and the studio was custom built specifically to produce the P90X series - simply amazing.";Not exactly what it promises, but still great.
75;42.0;5.0;27.0;Purchased this programe a week ago.  Of course, like everyone else I was skeptical. I walk daily but no strenght training. I thought this would probably be a waste of my time.

Flatter tummy, toned arms and legs, more energy. Though it was great while it lasted, I eventually got bored. Tony Horton is a great trainer. He's a little cheesy at times, but it gives me a laugh in the middle of my workout. I stopped using the workouts because I simply wasn't excited to workout anymore. This probably wouldn't have happened if the videos had better music and more of a ""pump"" to them. The point is, if you're the type of person that needs an upbeat environment to stick with a program, this probably isn't for you. If you prefer a calm, low-key environment to get fit, then it's perfect for you.\n\nI haven't used the program in several months and am currently shopping for another workout program to use at home.

107;44.0;2.0;29.0;I bought this after seeing the TV infomercial and even thought, based on the ad that this would be something we could do as a family - including my 10 year old and 8 year old children.  NOT!!  This is NOT for beginners!  Too many complicated moves, no explanation of how to do the moves, or even how to modify the moves for beginners.  I did the cardio one modifying as I thought I could, and then did the lower body one.  The cardio was a nice cardio workout.  The lower body one required a lot of upper body strength to do some of the moves - which I don't have much of - and really no discussion of how to modify the moves in any way.  Both workouts seemed to require that you already have a good understanding of the basics of each move.  Would have been nice to have just an instructional DVD regarding each move. But even with that, I would still be returning it today because this was too intense for my liking and my legs are so sore today that I can't even go up and down the stairs.  I don't want a product that is not going to allow me to work out daily like I want - I am so sore right now it will probably be a week before I will be able to get back into my prior exercise routine which is running 3 miles on my treadmill daily.;NOT for Beginners

This is truly not worth the $$, you are constantly changing dvd's as they recommend 3 different work outs for best results and there are several ads inbetween that you will need to FFW through which is not user/time friendly.\n\nMy next biggest problem with 10min trainer is you better know each video because they give you no time to get into position and the belt is way to big so it's slidding down and always getting rolled up causing it to be uncomfortable, the belt in my opinion is cheap.\n\nNow my biggest complaint with 10min traininer, if you like upbeat workouts that get you moving/motivated this is not for you! Tony Horton is constantly making annoying comments and strange noises through the entire workout which is a huge turn off, not to mention the music is terrible.;Boring and not worth the $$

Again, it is good, and the moves are truly inclusive of your whole body for the most part.  I just don't feel challenged after having graduated from the tougher, longer programs.\n\nSo ... if you are just beginning or not looking for any drastic body changes, this might be great for you.

50;53.0;2.0;19.0;I returned this. $80 for 5 ten minute workouts, and a weight band made in China that probably cost 20 cents to produce? They should be ashamed of themselves. I was first turned off when I ordered the product through their website. After I ordered, there were maybe 7 or 8 additional 'buy more' screens/products. Unbelievable. And as other reviewers have mentioned, there are tons of advertisements peppered throughout the program - on the DVDs and in the booklets. Very annoying. I spent enough on this worthless program! The workouts themselves: OK. Obviously they move really fast to get everything in in 10 minutes but I felt like I could really injure myself moving like that. And only 5 workouts, example: only one cardio segment, if I did that 3X a week I would get so sick of it by the second week. For $80 there should be multiple workouts for each type. Like other reviewers have said, it was annoying to switch DVD's between workouts, when all of the workouts could fit on one DVD. I bought a balance ball from Gaiam which included a DVD with more than 50 minutes of workouts for TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS.

They quickly charged my card, but I didn't get the product for a week and a half. This shouldn't surprise me since the rep yawned through our entire conversation when I was ordering it. Once I finally got the order, they didn't include the band. Yeah, another week to wait for that.\n\nSo I'm finally ready to work out. Hmmmm.... I don't seem to have a door in the middle of a room with plenty of area to workout with the band. So that's a big problem. Also, there are only three videos which I was under the impression I was getting a whole set for that price. Well... let's begin and see how it goes. Wow Tony has to be one of the most annoying people I've ever seen.  I found that turning him way down and putting on music that I liked helped a bit but then I of course was missing what he was saying. Plus he seems to be doing some moves that I clearly remember from other videos that were a big no no because they can cause injuries. I'm only 40 and in good shape, but my knees and back were NOT happy with me during and after these workouts.\n\nI'll be sending this product back. I've had much more success with my Jillian Michaels 30 day shred. I was just looking to add variety, but I'll find something else.;Find a better workout

108;58.0;4.0;21.0;The 10 minute training program is great, but to get the best results you're going to really have to do 30 minutes--three workouts a day. Still not so bad.\n\nOverall I think it's a great program for experienced exercisers who are looking to change things up, and for those new to working out.\n\nTony really packs a lot into the 10 minute segments, and he's really funny and entertaining. It's like having your own personal trainer.\n\nHowever, the abs workout is not fabulous. It relies on you doing a lot of core work, which, unless your core is already strong, you'll be using your arms and your hip flexors mostly, which is not ideal.\n\nThe yoga flex portion is also a little weak. If you've already been doing yoga, you may find it much too easy.\n\nI'm pretty fit, but I was a little sore for the first few days. The program is expensive, but I can see using this for a long time.;Great!
91;59.0;3.0;19.0;The  dvd are informative , but to do this system you need 30 minutes , 1 / 10 session for body 1 / 10 minute session for yoga  and a cardio session . But I use this yoga for flexibility, and I like it much better than P 90 X .I can always find 20 to 30 minutes to workout. You may need more Resistance bands to make your session more challenging, I only had 1 band;10 minute trainer
8;60.0;4.0;5.0;This has been great . We work out on average about 4 days a week and there are enough choices to combine for a longer workout or just do one of them if we are in a hurry. All of them give you a great workout in just 10 minutes!;This has been great. We work out on average about 4 days ...
115;61.0;5.0;21.0;I was a little skeptical about buying this product, but I am glad I did. The package comes with everything you need to do the workouts. And with just 10 minutes per workout time is not an issue...you really workout! I am sweating and huffing and puffing. Great dvds! It has only been 3wks and I already see great results!;GRRREEAATT!
92;62.0;4.0;18.0;I've been doing this workout for about a month and have seen improvements in my overall shape.  The only downside is the lack of variety in the workouts.  I assumed (stupidly - never assume anything) that there would be more than only one workout per area.  I'm getting sick of doing the same cardio, same abs, etc.  If you don't mind doing the same boring workout over and over this is for you.  Not sure it is worth the inflated price.;Good - But needs more variety
1;63.0;5.0;21.0;I love all of the 10 minute workouts in this package.  I do 2 routines a day alternating them and I really feel like I have worked my entire body.  I still do my fitness walking, but this really adds to my exercise routine.  My only complaint is that the package is a little expensive for what you recieve, but I love it, so that eases the pain in the pocketbook.  It is amazing how fast the 10 minute go, because he canges up moves so often.;Great Workout!
119;64.0;5.0;20.0;I am a college aged female trying to lose those last 10 lbs and I LOVE this system. I use to hate working out but Tony is a fantastic trainer and these workouts just fly by. You can start at any fitness level and work your way up with them and pick and choose as you please. I can tell I'm losing inches and I have been losing twice as much weight at my weekly weigh ins. Also, my fitness/endurance has gone up. In addition to 3 of these daily ( I follow his calendar plan) I try for 45 or so minutes of cardio at the gym. I use to not be able to run even 2 minutes and before these vids I was up to maybe 10. In just a month I can run 30 minutes straight now, and I have no doubt it was due to these videos...they make you sweat and they make you strong! Oh, and if you're one of those that complains about not being able to rest in between- DUH THAT IS THE POINT. It is 10 minutes! Also, I recommend watching them through first so you know kind of what is going on. They do transition fast but that is NO reason to complain as that is what we should want in a short workout! To actually work! Overall, I give it 5 stars and I definitely plan on buying more of Tony's videos after I finish 90 days of this one :);GREAT System! I recommend it!
45;65.0;2.0;14.0;For the amount I paid (close to $100), not worth it.  It has a low budget feel and it actually is a 14 minute workout if you add in the 2 minute warm-up (which basically consists of jumping up and down to get your blood flowing) and the 2 minute cool-down (some stretches).  The DVDs also comes in a flimsy cardboard cover.  I expected more for my money.;Ghetto
94;66.0;5.0;16.0;"I love this program. It's working for me, I've been doing this for 3 weeks and I'm 48 years old. I lost 6"" so far, 2"" in my lower ads. It's very easy too do.";Loving it!
18;67.0;1.0;11.0;"I did the ab workout, and the moves were fine--challenging and definitely a good workout for 10 minutes. Why the low rating then? Tony's attitude is a total turnoff! He says things like ""good girl!"" to the young woman who does the exercises on the video (he acts as the trainer so he doesn't actually do the moves). It sounds like he's talking to a dog/a child, and comes across as really patronizing/sexist. He also didn't make the workout very fun or interesting, like other trainers do in other videos.";Tony's personality a total turnoff
78;68.0;3.0;15.0;I should have known that 10 minutes was not going to be a workout with results. If you want to see results you should pick 3 of the workouts totaling 30 minutes per day...minimum. But that may not hold your interest for long. I have been doing 10 minute trainer for a week choosing 2 workouts per day. I mix it up and rotate different workouts for variety. I am already bored with them. Not enough selection to keep me interested. I dread doing cardio again,I'm so bored with it. I love Tony's P90X DVD collection and highly recommend that work out routine over this one. I guess if someone is busy enough where they can only do 10 minutes a day this is good but they shouldn't expect results or their interest to be held very long. If a workout becomes boring, chances are it won't get done and then it becomes a complete waste of money. I can see myself putting this on a shelf and visiting it about once a year for a week or so then forgetting about it again. Don't waste your time or money. Go with the P90X instead if you want great workouts and variation + results.;Not as good as P90X
86;69.0;3.0;15.0;I thought it would be a good filler when I didn't have time to do a full workout, but I have others that I think are just as effective. For the price I don't think it is worth it.;not so happy

10;71.0;1.0;8.0;I will make this short...this is one big promotional video.  Before each segment you have to listen to what is basically an infomercial, it is very annoying I just want to work out to the video not have to listen each time to the same commercial over again.  There is no way to fast forward this. The other issue I had is that unless you have the needed door hinges you are not able to do several of the segments.  Most doors in your home to  not have these hinges on the outside where you need to attach the band. So I decided this was not for me and returned this within a few days. All the material guaranteed a refund if returned within 30 days. Well that was over 3 months ago. After several long waits on hold and at least 2 very unhelpful customer service representatives. I still have not received my refund.  Now I can't get through to anyone.  Let the buyer beware...;Buyer Beware
51;72.0;2.0;13.0;I never thought it would be possible to have a meaningful workout in 10 minutes, but I thought this product would be a good variation to add to my routine.  The video does add variation to my routine, but after adding the warm up and the cool down (as you should be expecting to do), skipping the introduction, and selecting your workout, it is significantly longer than 10 minutes. Truth in advertising is why I gave this product two stars.  The whole product is center around being a 10 minute workout, but that it is not.;Not 1o Minutes
109;73.0;5.0;16.0;"My review here is for the Ten-Minute-Trainer (TMT) system; however there are several other variables at work here.\n\nFirst, you MUST change your lifestyle eating habits.  This includes most importantly getting a checkup from you Doctor and then avoiding all things that have FAT, CARBS, and SUGAR.  Find a weight loss center (B12 injections) and get your weight under control.  This is the FIRST key to your success.\n\nSecond, when setting goals start small and realistically.  Most start off by saying I want to lose X amount of pounds and then become frustrated and defeated when they haven't shed the weight in a small amount of time.  Hang in there, the weight will come off, but you must have patience and realize that at first you may lose a few (5-10) pounds during the fist week and find that you may only lose 1-3 pounds a week after that which may then thin out to only 1 pound a week.  It will come off but you can give it help by exercising.\n\nThird, the help you need (both men and women) is a simple and highly effective exercise system that you can do each and everyday and that is Tony Horton's TEN-MINUTE-TRAINER system!!!  Believe the infomercials, read the [...] reviews, do your research and you will conclude that this system works.  This is NOT the P90X system, this is an incredibly manageable system that will allow you to amp up your weight loss results and get you into incredible shape.\n\nFor me, I purchased BOTH the standard TMT and the TMT Deluxe and combined the programs together to integrate all of the dynamics that are found within the two systems.  From what I can see, I've created a kind of TMT-X program that I suspect will allow me to prepare to do the Power 90 system when I'm ready.  I've lost 50 pounds and am getting closer to my overall goal of losing 55.  That being said, I plan to continue doing my TMT-X program until the first week of April 2010 when I plan on tackling the Power 90 system and after that P90X in August 2010.\n\nDecide-Commit-Succeed.......TODAY!!!";Decide-Commit-Succeed!!!
9;74.0;1.0;6.0;Received this yesterday and it's going back. $90 for 8 ten minute workouts on one DVD would be overpriced if they were great workouts--these are mediocre.\n\nStart with the production value--these are obvious told workouts repackaged. Tony looks about -5 years younger, and the video quality looks like something from the 1990s--grainy, poor graphics, etc.\n\nWorkouts are decent but nothing special.\n\nI don't buy that many people would give this 5 stars. I think beach body or someone else is putting a bunch of fake reviews on Amazon.;Skeptical of the 5 star reviews
21;75.0;5.0;10.0;"I have spent a good amount of time reading the reviews of this product as it's a recent purchase and I agree with some and disagree with others.  First and foremost, I think this is a great product and it really does give you a good workout in a short amount of time.  One thing I would say is that as a P90X user, I felt that I was ahead of the game with some of the moves because you see many of them in that program.  I think that gave me an advantage of diving right in.  I fell a bit off the wagon and needed to get back into shape while not really ready for the rigor of the full P90X workouts in both intensity and time.  This did the trick.\n\nI don't know why some people are miffed that all the workouts are on one or two DVDs... it would be a waste to put only a ten minute workout one per disc!  Also, with any Beachbody product, you're going to have ads... that' s just the nature of the beast.\n\nI do see some people's ire with the door routines.  Much to my chagrin, the doors where I'm doing this workout don't have a middle hinge.  No big deal with the cardio, you don't need the set up, but I'll need to come up with a viable solution for the Upper Body workout when I get to that.\n\nAs for the complaints about it truly not being only ten minutes when you add in the warmup and cool down.  That's just nitpicking!  Also, the clocks stops sometimes within the routine, that's to help you set up to the next move!!!\n\nI actually like the Ab Ripper X routine from P90X better than the abs routine that is in Ten Minute trainer... This one is more pilates/yoga based.  There are good moves in each though, so I supplement them out for each other.  Like Tony says, ""variety is the spice of life""!";Another good Beachbody product
14;76.0;1.0;8.0;I'm sorry but this is NOT worth the money.  I returned it after 2 weeks.  I was stacking 3 workouts and that means doing the same workout over and over -very boring.  If you don't have a door close to where you workout forget using the extra resistance.  Yes you can do most without it but it makes the workout less intense.  His upper body workout does not even give you modifiers if you cannot use the resistance band so you have to make up your own!  The exercise band in the program comes in 3 pieces that you have to 'snap' together.  Mine kept unsnapping during the exercises which could lead to serious injury!  The girls doing the exercises were good but Tony was annoying often talking about sitting home smoking a cigarette.  Not very motivating in my book.  If this was priced at $19.99 I might have kept it but no way for close to $100!;I was stacking 3 workouts and that means doing the same workout over and over -very boring.

42;77.0;1.0;11.0;While I'm sure this product is useful for some, it was not suited for my level of training.  We returned the product and decided to go at it the old fashioned way... at the gym and in the garage.;Actually returned the product
64;78.0;2.0;12.0;I found it tedious to switch out the DVD's and thereby interrupt the flow of the work out. Why not put everything on one. It's not that extensive. I consider the cost way too much for the content. I've bought much better ones for a lot less.;Too much money
104;79.0;5.0;13.0;I love working out. I love P90x, and Insanity. I got this work out because of my busy life in hopes I would be able to get the same great work out but in less time. I must say this kicked my butt an I was very shocked! The work outs are very good;Kicked my Butt
13;80.0;5.0;7.0;"I got this directly from Beachbody, not Amazon, but it is the EXACT SAME thing.  And I was billed in only two installments (first one included shipping). That was it.\n\nUnlike some other reviews, particularly the lower ratings, my review is for the product, how it worked for me and the quality of the actual material and not whether I found Tony Horton entertaining or whether I feel he custom tailored this especially for me (really people???).  We are all different and it is up to us to control what we do and how much, not someone else.  I am astounded at some of the one star reviews, many which seem to be whining about Horton not tailoring this workout for their own specific physical situations. We are adults, people!  If you are not aware of your physical condition and limitations, do not expect anyone else to do it for you. One reviewer even complained that Horton is annoying.  Frankly, I got this to get in shape, not for Horton to do a tap dance routine and entertain me while I work out.  As it is, I found him entertaining enough.  The low ratings feel more like they are coming from a ME mindset than anything else.  Still, I usually will read one star reviews first before going for a product and work my way up to the five stars so I can get the big picture.  But generally, save for a few good ones, one star reviews always seem to fall into the self-entitled complaints that have nothing to do with the product itself.\n\nThe workouts are challenging.  If they are not, (as one reviewer stated with their one star review) then you're in a heck better shape than most of us who buy this product and probably need to be looking at the other products like the 30 or 90 minute programs that seem to kick your behind into shape with military training style!  Personally, I lack the killer instinct and needed a workout I could fit into my schedule AND do without excuses.  A friend of mine is doing the P30 something or other and she loves it. I like the 10 minute one.\n\nSo, how did it work for me?  Great!\n\nFirst off, the 10 minute thing REALLY did it for me.  I now DO my workouts daily and have NO excuse.  I tell myself, ""Come on, it is only ten minutes...sure, ten hellish minutes, but TEN minutes."" And I DO IT.  So, starting out, that worked for me.\n\nThe first week I thought I was going to die.  And I was in generally decent shape.  So, it is definitely a challenging workout.  I originally thought, ""How can this possibly do anything in 10 minutes a day.""  Boy, was I corrected!  I like that Tony Horton generally will have someone else working out the routines (except a few he does himself) because the form corrections he makes on the individual feel like he is doing for me, and it has helped tremendously for me to get the form right.  The better your form, the more you will get out of the program. Another incentive is, he keeps you going, right when you're about to drop and quit. I need that encouragement.\n\nI like that you do not do the same workouts every day.  The product comes with a monthly calendar and tells you which one to do, then you pop in the DVD and select the appropriate workout.  And yes, there are some ads, as some complained, but I find these interesting and generally they come AFTER the workout except for a 30 second one before each workout. And, after all people, this is why we have a remote with a forward feature!\n\nWhat I also liked is that he does not expect you to, right off the bat, do it all without stopping.  He encourages you to pause if you need to, or do alternate moves to make it easier.  If you're a beginner, you WILL need to. I paused every so often either to get the movements correctly or because I got to where I just could not breathe!  However, by week two, my stamina and endurance went up. I paused less and breathed better.  You'll find that as you get to know the routines, you will find them easier to do.\n\nPersonally, I am finding after a few weeks that my body is starting to get back in shape. I was not going to, but I decided to add the Shakeology to the workouts and have had these for a few days and already noticing more of a difference (and I LOVE THEM), but you to not HAVE to do that.  It was my choice.  The workouts will work great on their own, with the right amount of time -- you are not going to look like Superman/Supergirl in a week.  But do this daily as it is meant to be done and you WILL notice the difference.  I did notice that as the workouts progressed, I was hungrier, which is probably where the Shakeology shakes come in handy.  If you are going to go pig out at McDonald's after each workout, I venture to say this may not work for you as good as you may want to, otherwise, you'll be fine.\n\nAlso for some who complained that this is not challenging enough, or for when you get so used to the program that it becomes easy, you can stack them up. Otherwise, you can move on to the other ones they offer.  Frankly, this 10 minute thing works for me.\n\nI would say that my ONLY complaint so far is that the waist resistance band is coming apart only after a few weeks.  Obviously, someone is not checking the Chinese quality control!  Still, no biggie, I can sew it back together with ease or I am sure BeachBody will replace it.\n\nI hope I have helped someone understand what this does and maybe make the decision to go for it and change their health and life. I will update in a few more weeks.";It works for me!
95;81.0;2.0;12.0;The workout is good - hard but it would have been better had they included what I paid for - the exercise band. Never got it and requests netted nothing.;MIA

22;83.0;5.0;8.0;Getting back into working out after two winters off getting PT for a dislocated hip, pelvis and knee (horseback riding wreck).  After 8 months of PT and 5 prolotherapy treatments, I was ready to move!  The 10 minute trainer is perfect for those start-up weeks (boy, am I outta shape!) and even after only a few weeks of doing the full workouts (three each day in the combo recommended) I'm already seeing results.  Kudos to Tony Horton for a great workout concept and thanks Amazon for carrying this DVD set.;10 minute trainer DVD
59;84.0;5.0;10.0;I love this product! The videos are entertaining, and very insightful. When you are doing the exercises it gives you good instructions on how to do the move and shows you different ways you can do if you aren't in the best of shape yet. I swear I am not that out of shape and I get so tired after 10 mins of working out. I love it. I lost 5 pounds within the first 2 weeks. I wasn't even trying hard. It tells you to do up to 3 video's a day if time permits or just the 1, and I only do 1 and have already seen results. Looser pants, slimming waist, and compliments from all my friends and family. I def would recommend this to anyone who has time restrictions, children who don't give you time to work out or just anyone looking to loose the few extra pounds.;Best Workout Ever
60;85.0;4.0;10.0;So I recently purchased the 10 minute trainer package.  Overall I do like the program and I like that the exercises are fast paced and like the title indicates, only 10 minutes in length (however adding warmup and cool down it brings it closer to 14 minutes).  Tony is a funny, personable, and motivating on the programs.\n\nSo those were the positives, here are the negatives.  All the exercises are compressed onto 2 DVD's which makes it a pain if you need to alternate exercises.  It is recommended that you actually do 3 workouts during a session rather than just 1.  This wouldn't be that big a deal but when you have to sift through the promotions, warning messages, etc. it can become quite annoying.  I ended up creating my own backup DVD using my PC to combine all the workouts on a single DVD so I did not have to switch. A lot of the bonus items you are unlikely to use unless you want to join their >$100 shakeology program.  The cardio belt I can't use because I do not have a door fortunately situated close to my TV.  On my DVD player the cooldowns would not load automatically so I had to manually fast forward to get to them.  This was due to my DVD player as it worked fine in another one but still annoying.  Since the workouts are not very long (10 minutes each) there is not a lot of material to warrant the high purchse price.  The resistance bands are pretty good quality but at this price, they could have thrown in a mat. So overall I like the program but took off 1 star for the price/value.  I would probably give this 3 1/2 stars if that was a choice.;Pretty good program but overpriced
11;86.0;5.0;6.0;I love this 10-minute workout set and have been using it for months now.  Tony Horton is a great (clean) motivator.  The workouts are intense but they are short and go by fast.  I like that they contain the countdown timer with each workout, as it helps me get through it on days that I'm not that motivated.  If you have not worked out in a long time, I would suggest you start with one workout per day, and then build from there when you are ready.  I usually stack two workouts per day and that seems to work for me.  Once in a while, or on the weekends if I have more time, I will do three workouts in one day, but usually two are just right.  My husband said he saw me get more results from using this DVD set, than when I was going to the gym 3-4 times a week!;Highly recommend!
102;87.0;4.0;11.0;This is the most efficient, yet challenging workout program I've ever done.  It really makes you sweat!  I'm more into toning my body than losing weight, but I did drop a couple of pounds in a month despite eating more junk food than I have in a long time (hey, it was around Halloween - I can't let my kids eat all that unhealthy food themselves, right?).  I'm sure if I was a discliplined eater and wanted to lose weight, this program would do it.\n\nAs it is, I definitely got toned up already and am looking forward to more results as I continue to use this program.  My only complaint is that some of the moves are hard to watch on the TV and execute at the same time.;Glad I Bought It!
16;88.0;3.0;7.0;"This workout is great. After only ten minutes you are definitely feeling the burn. MAJOR DRAWBACK: the workouts are on separate discs. So, you have to do 3 10-minute workouts for most effectiveness. But, you do one workout; you stop, eject disc, load another, wait for ads to play; do second workout; you stop, eject disc, load another, wait for ads to play; do third workout. Meanwhile, your muscles are not only screaming at you because you did these great workouts, but because you warmed up, worked out, improperly cooled down, worked out, improperly cooled down, worked out, then cooled down.\n\nSo, they are great workouts, just don't plan to follow the calendars because they have your system all screwed up. Stick to one disk with multiple workouts.";Great Workout, bad set-up
85;89.0;4.0;10.0;As a P90x owner, I was looking for a workout that didn't take an hour or two to complete, but give me results. 10 Minute trainer won't give you the results of P90X, but it will give you results with a lot less time. The only thing i don't like is that the workout guide has you bouncing between DVDs if you do more than one workout.;Great product if you have a little time
33;90.0;1.0;8.0;I did not like this product (10 minute trainer). No i would not recommend it to anyone else. The voice on the DVD did not match the up with people on the DVD. Poor Quality. It was like watching a bad boot leg movie. Beachbody Inc was dead wrong to sell this type of material. Never again!!!!!!!!;poor quality.
112;91.0;4.0;11.0;I bought the 10-minute Trainer because I am a working mother and have little time for myself to exercise. I love that each segment is only 10 minutes long.  I believe the whole idea is to hook you with the 10 minute cardio training and then you find the time to do the other 10 minute segments. Well...it works!  I have been working out with these tapes for only 2 weeks and I can already see that I'm toning up - especially my thighs and abs!  Each task is less than 2 minutes and Tony finds a way to keep you occupied and no time to feel like you're working out!  This would make a great gift for anyone who doesn't have a lot of time to go to a gym.;great for busy moms!
66;92.0;5.0;9.0;"As someone who has done Insanity and P90x, I knew Beachbody puts out a quality product. When I saw this infomercial, I knew I had to get it.  I have 10 minutes!  Insanity and P90x require too much time. With two kids under 6, that just wasn't happening.  Now, I can get up 15 minutes earlier in the morning and I watch 15 minutes less of tv at night.  I've already seen my body change in just 1 1/2 weeks!  As long as you eat right, this 10 minute workout will increase your weight loss and tighten your body.  If you say you don't have 10 minutes, then you are only kidding yourself.  There really is no excuse. Some moves are challenging, but so is any workout; that's why quality workouts are the best ones. You have to build towards something, not be able to do it perfectly to start.  Get this product!  Well worth the money.";I've Got 10 Minutes!!
38;93.0;2.0;8.0;I purchased this product based advertising a variety of exercieses at only 10 minutes a day.  My purchase was approximately $75.  What I received was one rubber band, an attachment to use for arobics and a DVD.  Unfortunately there were more advertisements on the DVD than exercises.  Way over priced for what you get.  I can not recommend this product.;Over priced advertisement
68;94.0;5.0;9.0;My son finished P90X last summer, and it transformed his already athletic body to a muscular athletic body.\n I tried some of the exercises on the P90X and if you have the stenima and dedication to the program THIS works without a doubt. Tony does know what he is doing . It is just a matter of your ! dedication to his programs.\nThe same is being said for the 10 min. workout, so far we had just conquered week one, the workouts are intense,but every work out, even abs will get you sweating before the 10 min. are up.\nI read from a few reviewers that they posted how hard the program is , even for someone who works out regularly, to this I would like to say, I am not someone who works out regularly, but someone who has 10 more pounds to loose ( I have been watching my calorie, fat intake, and mainly how much I eat , and having lost 20 pds in 1 year I know I need to incorporate exercise to loose those 1o pounds and to also stay at my current weight) Yes the workout will leave you (unless you are a work out pro) gasping for air, your heart rate will be up and you will be sweating , but the program is do-able for everyone ! who puts their mind on wanting it to work. Tony does a fantastic job of encouraging you and on the trainer track gives you many hint on how to modify the exercises when you are a beginner like me (44 yrs) .\nWe are currently doing the 10 min, work out , and hopefully next week on a few days will commit to 20 min.\nHonestly the best 10-20 you can dedicate to doing some exercise every day, to get you the heart rate going and sweat. Definitly my choice over running 5 miles a day for an hours etc.\nHope this review helped\n\noh one thing I wanted to mention, is that even on the pic. it shows 5 DVD's, my package came with 2, but it actually works better as you do not constantly have to switch out DVD's .;Definitly works
40;95.0;2.0;8.0;I'll bet lots of hardcore fitness folks appreciate and benefit from this program. If you are already in fabulous cardio fitness, it might provide a variation in your standard routine. If you are getting off the couch this new year and need some motivation... not sure this is the way to jump in. Very difficult to alter the hardcore version to something that's manageable enough to ease into and build up stamina. Painful for me in a physically negative way, not in a good, getting healthier way. I'll stick with running, weights and sports training.;Not for me
83;96.0;4.0;9.0;I could never stick with a workout video because it just took too long.  The 10 minute sessions are fun and fast moving.  Before you know it, you are done and even ready to try a second or third one.  An exercise plan doesn't do a thing for you if it sits in it's box!  I highly recommend this product to anyone who has trouble starting or staying with exercising.;Doable
53;97.0;4.0;8.0;I won't go into a long, detailed review but I will say that this system is working great for me. I had been working out in a gym about 2-3 times a week for a year when I had to give up my membership fees for more important bills. After about 7 months of no exercise I noticed all my body parts turning into gelatin!! I needed to do something but didn't want to join another gym. I looked at doing the P90X workouts but wasn't ready to pay the high price when I wasn't sure if I'd even like working out at home. Then I came across the 10 Minute Trainer. It was a price I was willing to pay. After two weeks of doing three workouts per day, I went shopping for new clothes and could already see the difference in my abs and legs!!\n\nI wasn't looking to drop several pounds and I am already a very healthy eater so I didn't do the diet plan that comes with the videos. Also, I don't consider myself a beginner but I did find the workouts challenging. I'm on my third week and I am just now able to do some excercises I couldn't do in the beginning and there are still others I am continuing to work on. I see this as a bonus as it gives me something to work towards and makes my results more gratifying when I am noticing the moves get easier. I can feel every excercise work as I am doing. I actually feel like I work harder and sweat more in thirty minutes of Ten Minute Trainer than when I would spend an hour and a half at the gym!!! I like Tony. He's not cheesy or annoying but goofy enough to keep your mind off what you are doing.\n\nMy only cons are much the same as others:\n1. The advertisements. After watching the videos once or twice I figured out when to fast forward, but it's still a little annoying to have to do. Some of the other work outs advertised look interesting, so I have watched them to get an idea for future work outs I might want to try when I plateau on TMT.\n2. Seperate videos. All the workouts are on two DVD's and when doing the workout plan that the set comes with, I am constantly have to switch them out. Although it does give me a minute to rest and catch my breath in between.\n\nAll in all the cons are not enough to keep me from working out or make me regret my purchase. I still highly recommend this to anyone who is looking to tone up and get back in shape if your are too out of shape already.;Just what I was looking for!!
114;98.0;2.0;10.0;"These workouts are not easy, and there are five of them at 10 minute apiece. You get the stretchy band which provides some, but not much resistance and a great ""on the go"" workout plan with some other stuff.\n\nI think this is a good workout system, [...]";Challenging - yes. Overpriced - yes
36;99.0;1.0;7.0;I did not receive the workout for busiest people - I was sent a beach body work out that was so advanced, I couldn't even do the warm up.  I sent it back.;Did not receive the package I ordered

111;101.0;5.0;9.0;yes, this is a great product.  Our entire family is using it.  THe only drawback is that the men in the family are trimming down faster than the women!  It's a great, easy product to follow and worth the $$.;Awesome
47;102.0;5.0;7.0;Its very easy to follow and I lost 8lbs in 2 weeks in 10 min you are done so there are no excuses  it's very refreshing to feel good in such a shot time l ve already recommend it to all my friends even the slim ones need it to tone.this is the best l ve seen so far;This product works
54;103.0;5.0;7.0;"I only use 3 workouts out of the DVDs, which are the abs, lower body, and total body! THEY WORK! if you are doing them correctly then you should feel the burn and if you've done them too much then it's time to switch up your workout regimen...if you have never lifted a finger, I assure you you will feel the burn! I am a bit lazy at times and fall in and out of not working out especially throughout my pregnancies and what not and now in my 3rd pregnancy I was tired throughout until recently. I started doing 2 workouts a day (total of 20 minutes) lower body and total body and I can feel the burn and I LOVE IT, it works and I have 10 weeks left of pregnancy to go and I want to be toned so that when the baby arrives I can possibly bounce back quicker...do not listen to those negative people and their reviews...it's either they are doing it wrong or lazy or have grown accustomed to the workouts and need something vigorous like insanity or something LOL, I love my dvd's and have had them since 09 and use them time to time and just recently started using them again and I've done it 5 times within 1 week and can see dramatic results! I haven't done the abs in a long time and not planning on it until the baby arrives but the lower body and total body working with great results...I don't remember where I bought this, as I bought it back in 09 and I didn't pay the price listed here on amazon, I got mine cheaper with the whole bundle and the resistant band so shop around and I'm sure you will find a steal of a deal! =D\n\n2/11/15:\nUpdate...still have it and still use it ;O)\nI love this!!! If you take a long break and hit it again, it never gets old! EXCEPT for when you are hurting while doing them and wanna punch tony in his face for making such a great workout!";10 minutes really works!
28;104.0;2.0;6.0;I have a hunch that this was priced high to motivated people to use it. While this may be true, it is very difficult to ignore the fact that you pay almost $90 for a CD and a elastic rope plus a lot of paper advertising! I get as much exercise out of kicking my behind for buying this as I get out of the CD itself! Interested in buying one? Contact me first and $30 and it is yours!;Over priced program.
29;105.0;1.0;6.0;I expected the full DVD work-out as I had seen on TV this was only three DVD's I sent it back;Not what I expected returned it
70;106.0;5.0;7.0;Bought this after watching the Dr. Oz show. It is just what I needed. I already had a food plan but this exercise plan is excellent. I needed something short but exhilirating. I am out of breath at the end of eachh 10 minute segment. Love it!;This is it!
73;107.0;5.0;7.0;"My wife and I have been using the 10 minute trainers for awhile now. We really enjoy the fact that each video is broken down into 10 exercises, each only 1 minute long. It helps us push through: ""come on, it's ONLY ONE minute!"" The videos can push you, but you don't feel ""forced"" to over-exert yourself.\n\nAlso, with the series being ""modular"" as it is, we are able to customize our daily workout routine. For example, On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, I do Total Body once, and the Cardio twice. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I do the Lower Body, ABS, and Yoga Flex. On Saturdays, I do the Total Body, Cardio, and Yoga Flex. I take Sundays off.\n\nMy wife has her own routine with the videos. It's nice, because you're not committed to a whole 45 minute workout video. if you want to work a specific area more, you can just do that particular video twice.\n\nWe really enjoy the way the workouts flow, Tony pays close attention to making sure you get an even workout (both sides of the body get the same work, etc.) which is strangely rare in workout videos.\n\nI recommend these videos to anyone interested in developing a more healthy lifestyle!";Great Workout Series
41;108.0;5.0;6.0;These videos are amazing! I love how you have the option to let Tony talk to you as a trainer and an option to have the background music. The included schedule lets you personalize your workout. 6 days have 3 different workouts on them, each being ten minutes. For best results do all three, but if you have 10 minutes only, do 1 and if you have 20, do 2. You have one day off. I must admit, I was skeptical at first that 10 minutes would achieve anything, but I can really feel the results. You definitely have to be self motivated to do this though, but if you know you can, I say go for it!;I'm so glad I bought this!
87;109.0;5.0;7.0;I saw a commercial for the 10 minute workout on TV.  I already own the P90X system and am a pretty regular person in the gym.  The P90X is great, but the workouts are a full hour.  There are many days that I don't have the full hour, especially on top of my cardio time.  This 10 minute workout was a great addition to my exercise library.  The exercises are doable and can be adjusted to accommodate your level of fitness. I love the 5 routines and alternate them, even on days when I do my regular gym workout because they are short, focused and strenuous.  Just what I was looking for.  Also, I take the band and set with me when I travel.  The exercises do not take alot of floor space so they are great to keep up the routine when on the road.;10 mnute workout
20;110.0;4.0;5.0;it takes some getting used to tony Horton's kind of creepy way of talking and interacting with the young women in his videos, but, if you do three workouts, not just the one 10 minute work out, you will see results.  10 minutes just gets you hooked in and it's a start, but you need to do the whole thing.;gets the job done
46;111.0;5.0;6.0;Wow who knew that in just ten minutes I was able to work out my whole body . This product is not for those who are very out of shape because I had a hard time following a lot of those moves they did but Tony stated that anyone can do it by starting slow. Overall I would recommend this product for a great work out in just ten minutes.;Wow! In just ten minutes your worked out.
121;112.0;5.0;8.0;I really enjoy this product.  I like to go to the gym, but when I just don't have the time, I can still get my workouts with these videos, and they do give you a WORKOUT!  Amazon.com provided them for such a great price and the shipping was exceptional.\n\nThanks!;Love the product
0;113.0;3.0;8.0;I own a lot of exercise DVDs, but this is not one of my favorites.  I've also purchased two other exercise systems from Tony Horton.  I guess he just isn't one of my favorites.  The workouts did make me sweat some, but I will probably end up passing this one on to a family member.;It is OK
25;114.0;3.0;5.0;"Not for everybody\nFirst the advertisement for the product is misleading - it makes one believe that all it takes is a 10 minute workout.  But when one reads the instructions they recommend two to three of these ~10 min workouts per day!?\nThree of us tried these workouts for 15 days (5 days/week) as recommended in the instructions:\n* A daily runner found it too easy - not a cardio workout.\n* Regular shape person - good\n* Obese person - killer for knees due to - the lateral movements and - squat after squat in the ""Lower Body"" section\n\nWe three agree that the yoga portion is for people who know some yoga. No explanation is given on how to achieve the stretches e.g. ""chicken something"".\n\nWe all found the ab. work challenging but nothing one hasn't seen in a Pilates workout. Notice - NO explanations on how to stabilize your back or neck are given for these ab. exercises.\nIf one wants to learn the proper ab.form: Moira Merrithew does a great job in explaining the basics Stott Pilates - Essential Matwork.\n\nFor toning, gaining good posture and balance we three all recommend:\nT-Tapp Total Workout  by Teresa Tapp - it's a rehabilitation approach that really works, and the best way to get rid of backaches. Not a cardio workout, but definitely worth the time.";It depends!
26;115.0;5.0;5.0;This workout is everything I needed but condensed down into 10 minute workouts! Perfect for always on the go Mothers. I've seen really good results with this program.\n\nI recently had another child so I was eager to get my body back again. I didn't realize how out of shape I was until I popped this DVD in and began my workout. Boy was I sweating my butt off in just 10 minutes!! WHAT?!? How could this be. I've been to the gym to workout for over an hour but never again! I'm telling you this really does work! and the time goes by so quickly. We all have 10 minutes in the day. I started this workout in June and I have lost 29lbs thus far.\n\nI wanted to try insanity but my back injury just wouldn't allow for all those movements.

I was skeptical of just 10 minutes, but it gets my heart rate going and I feel it AND I don't need anything but the included band. My wife loves the results too.;Liked p90X, but this is better for Time

Thanks for a great product otherwise!";You end up doing more than 10!
31;120.0;5.0;5.0;My wife and I bought the 10 Minute Trainer to complement the other exercise we do.  We swim and run, but wanted to add some additional cardio and resistance training.  We've used the videos (5 workouts on 2 DVDs) for the last month and love them.  It is exactly what we were looking for.  Tony is an excellent and fun trainer.  Each 10 minute segment flies by.  I do recommend buying additional resistance bands to vary the resistances or if more than one person will be working out at a time.;Great workouts, exactly what we hoped for
116;121.0;4.0;7.0;the photo with the ad misleads the customer.. you did not receive the cardio belt with the resistance band.. and all of the extra products that appear on the photo you do not get.. the abs and 10 day lean jeans.. totally misleading.. the seller should only show what they were selling which was 2 cds the tony horton's 10 minute trainer 3 workouts(total body,lower body, abs) and 2 workouts of cardio and yoga flex..\n\ni enjoy what i have but expected more..\n\ni rate this product 4 stars.. awesome workout.. quick burning... i have my entire office working out to these dvd every night.. this helps me alot..\n\nthanks tony horton for pushing..;great product but the imagery use to sell the product was false

I'm no athlete by a long shot, and worried it would be too intense for a 50yr old fat chick, but I was able to keep up and that boosted my confidence like crazy! Tony doesnt nag you to death.

63;126.0;5.0;5.0;I love this product. I'm seeing results its wonderful. I lost 10 lbs in a week using this plus an app on my phone called My fitness pal, the combo of these two is great. This program is so convenient, it can literally fit any schedule. On days when I'm on the go I can do 10 mins and be done, and I can REALLY feel it from head to toe, and other days I can get a 20-30 minute workout. I would recommend this product to anyone, I know the price seems like a lot but with dedication it is definetly worth the money. I've tried other programs and I've never been as dedicated as I am to this, It's fast, easy, and fits into my day. I make it a priority and look forward to doing it. I hope this helps anyone thats considering. I also purchased the beach body 2 day fast system, this is also worth giving a try before starting a workout regimen. GOOD LUCK!;I LOVE this product!
69;127.0;5.0;5.0;I love this workout system. I started with 10 minutes a day, moved to 20, then 30 and now I do 40. I get stronger every day. I see a huge improvement in my core and leg strength. I don't think that you can get into great shape in 10 minutes a day, but the way the workouts are broken down into 10 minute segments, it allows you to start small and increase a little at a time. The workouts are tough at first, but the hardest one, abs, has a lot of modifications to help beginners along. I really have disliked workout videos in the past, but this one is very clear, easy to follow and very effective.;increase strength quickly

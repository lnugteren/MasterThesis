48;1.0;1.0;377.0;Update: I wrote this review before a firmware update was made available and my comments reflect the situation at the time.  When the updates were made available, I flashed my 5 drives and they've been working fine ever since.  I'd change the rating to a 4 star if the editor allowed.\n\nI and many others have been experiencing serious problems with these drives including:\n\n* dropping out of RAID configurations for no apparent reason\n* being ejected from a RAID configuration due to read / write errors\n* freezing for up to 30 seconds\n\nThese problems have been reported on Linux, Vista, XP, and OS X and appear to be related to how the drives flush their write cache.  In many cases, the drives work fine for days or weeks before problems appear.  In my case, I bought five of these for my Qnap TS-509 Pro and they worked great for about two weeks under various read / write loads.  Since then, I've had all three of the problems mentioned above on different drives and they are growing progressively worse.  The latest problem was three of the five drives disappearing from the RAID5 volume while I was attempting to copy the files to a different NAS.\n\nA work-around that has been successful for some is to disable the disk write cache.  Other than the obvious performance penalty and reduced lifespan this causes, some systems do not provide a means of disabling disk write cache (such as the Qnap).\n\nReferences to these problems can be found on many forum threads:\n\nQnap:  [...]\nNetgear: [...]\nSynology: [...]\nAVSForum: [...]\nmacrumors: [...]\nUbuntu: [...]\nSlashdot: [...]\nAmazon: http://www.amazon.com/review/product/B00066IJPQ/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?_encoding=UTF8&showViewpoints=1\n\nThe most informative thread may be found on Seagate's own support forum, where it appears Seagate is blaming everyone but themselves for the problem:\n\n[...];Works fine after applying firmware update
39;2.0;5.0;299.0;NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED:\nI've watched the issue with these drives carefully for about 2 months. It looks like Seagate solved the problem and that a vocal few were ever really affected.  By few I mean relative to the thousands sold.  And I am not defending Seagate.  This whole fiasco was unacceptable.\n\nMY SYSTEM:\nI picked up 8 of these drives.  I'm running them in 4 separate DLink DNS-321 RAID boxes.  I've copied about 4TB of data back and forth across them for days. My only firmware update needed was for the DLink so that it could properly handle the new 1.5TB drives.\n\nIn the end I believe all is well with both the drives and the DLink DNS-321.  I will of course update this review immediately if I see any problems.\n\nPERFORMANCE:\nWe are able to watch movies from this drive arrangement on 3 computers simultaneously across a 100mb network from the same drive while adding new files to the drive from a 4th computer.\n\nThis means I can be adding movies unattended to the system while watching an Epic Man movie on the plasma in the living room...  while the kids are watching Monsters Inc in the bedroom...  and the wife is off watching some chic flick in the Den. :)\n\nThe combination of DLink and these 1.5TB drives is fantastic and seems as stable as the WD 1TBs I was using previously.\n\nPROPER DIAGNOSIS:\nDon't confuse your drive DIEING after a week with the previous firmware problems of this particular drive.  Blame the vendor that shipped the drive like it could bounce !\n\nON A SIDE NOTE:\nI will say I am sick of Amazon, Tiger and other vendors shipping hard drives like they are indestructible ROCKS.  Even if they arrive working, this inadequate packaging is certainly taking years off the life of our drives.  One of my 8 arrived DEAD as a brick thanks to this nonsense.  I am furious about this issue !\n\nWill it take a class action to stop this behavior of guaranteeing future drive sales by damaging todays drives through deliberate mishandling of our purchases ?! Wake up AMAZON !  Wake up TIGER !\n\nUPDATE: Dec 14 2009\nOne year later, I own 22 of these drives now. 12 are running daily in DNS-321 Raid boxes.  The other 10 are used as back up drives in a drop in SATA adapter.  No failures since 2 in the first few weeks, I believe due to poor packaging.  About 6 of my drives came with the BAD firmware.  I never had issues with that either.  Call me blessed.  I just think the DNS-321 and these drives work very well together.\n\nUPDATE: Jan 8 2011\nAnother year passes and most of my 1.5TBs have all been pulled from DNS-321 RAID boxes and used as loose backup drives in a drop in SATA adapter.  I've replaced them with the larger Seagate 2TB drives for larger capacity.  NO FAILURES OF EITHER DRIVE 1.5TB or 2TB !  I have a couple Hitachi's and WD 2TBs.  The Seagate drives are quieter and come off sleep in my RAID boxes faster than the other brands.  All are used for video streaming over a network and do a fantastic job.\n\nTIGER has been shipping drives MUCH BETTER.  Amazon packagers have sent me drives packed poorly just 2 months ago.  I requested replacements and Amazon handled the no charge exchange well.  But they should NOT have been shipped that way.;I believe problems are resolved !
4;3.0;4.0;6.0;Why doesn't amazon separate the 1 Tb from the 1.5 TB from the 750 GB from the 500 GB reviews???????  It is impossible to make a decision based on the reviews when one is looking for a 750 GB drive and all the reviews are for other drives.  How is this useful?!!!;Why doesn't amazon separate reviews?

34;6.0;1.0;40.0;"Just read all the other 1 star reviews here and on other sites (rhymes with ""egg""). As everybody has written, there is a serious problem with these drives. Besides the DOE and early failures the most reported problem is the freezing. I bought 3 of these for my HTPC and whenever I play anything (VIDEO_TS, mkv, avi, divx...) I consistently get after 3-5 minutes freezing for about 1-2 minutes. It is very annoying in a HTPC but in a RAID this spells disaster. The worst part of this is that Seagate is doing the ""head in the sand"" tech support. This reminds me of the Intel P4 math error when Intel initially stated that it wasn't a problem, then that it was not a big deal and then finally replaced all those faulty CPU's.\nApparently nobody at Seagate has the guts and brains to come forward and call a spade a spade.\nNobody should buy any more Seagate drives until they post a fix on the main product page or the main tech support page. I went to the Seagate forums and there are many messages of people calling and emailing and just being ignored for weeks. There are even firmware updates on bittorrent (WTF?). What kind of company deserts their customers to the point that they have to search on torrents for a solution???\nI just hope that a big Class-Action law firm will loose their data with these drives and take them to the cleaners. Any company that has this much disdain for their customers should be severely punished. At least the CTO and the responsible persons for tech support and customer service should be fired.\nMaybe an internet-wide Seagate boycott will wake them up!";Seagate junk, horrible tech support!
28;7.0;1.0;39.0;"Update Review on September 22, 2009 **** 4 Stars\n===================================================\n\nAt the beginning of this year, I wrote a scathing review of this product after numerous problems.  To summarize, Seagate had a total mess on their hands with 3 different hardware revisions and over a dozen firmwares out in the span of a couple months.  There were massive problems, and Seagate tech support was completely overwhelmed.  I had problems of drives freezing, terrible noises on start up, reallocated sectors, and the ""click of death"".\n\nFast forward.  I have had the latest hardware revision -302 with firmware CC1H on 3 drives for about 8 months.  These have had NO problems.  I just purchased my 4th of these drives from Amazon a couple days ago, and I can confirm they are still -302 hardware and CC1H firmware.  This latest one was very well packed by Amazon in a ""manufacturer-type"" drive box.  No issues with the current packaging (although some in the past from Amazon were questionable).  A full surface scan came up with no errors.  I have added a customer image of my oldest drive.  It is important to realize that the massive complaints of problems and failures could be with the earlier hardware revisions and firmware.\n\nI can't give this product 5 stars due to the past problems, and because there are no guarantees the ones I have won't fail before the warranty is up.  (The new 2TB green drives are now having massive failures/problems.)  Of the 3 I have, only 1 has ""normal"" hours on it, as the other 2 were backup only.  I have had other drives fail in the past couple years including a WDC Raptor, a WDC laptop drive, and a Deskstar, so I believe this last version is no worse than others out there.\n\nOne thing to recognize with modern drives is that they are no way as reliable as their MTBF reliability specs indicate.  Hard drives are dirt cheap these days and drive manufacturers are hurting.  Solid state drives will only hurt them more.  I now look at drives as disposable, and keep several backups.  This drive finally looks stable and has a very low cost per GB along with enough capacity to last you several more years.\n\nPrevious Review\n====================================================================\n\nThere is a fair amount of misinformation in various reviews.  First, these are 4-platter drives.  Next, they are part of the Seagate 7200.11 series.  Both this drive and the 1TB have serious issues.  Seagate support is completely overwhelmed.  If you do not know about these, just surf forums dot seagate dot com for literally hundreds of pages of problems.\n\nI had purchased two of these after reading that firmware bugs had been finally worked out with SD1A.  To give you an idea, Seagate has gone though something like SD13, SD14, SD15, SD17, SD19, SD35, SD37, and SD1A.  The only problem is that while the model number of this product is ST31500341AS, the part number is 9JU138-XXX, and SD1A only works on 9JU138-300 drives.  I received one 9JU138-301 and one 9JU138-302 which are apparently, incompatible, different hardware revisions.  These latter drives use firmware revisions including CC1F, CC1G, CC1H, and CC1J where people are experiencing similar and different problems.  There is such a mess of problems with these drives that Seagate support can't even keep up.\n\nTo make a long story short, one of my drives makes a terrible buzzing sound on power-up which has been reported by others.  Otherwise, it worked seemingly OK for a week or so.  Now, I get random read/write stalls, and I get the now-famous ""click of death"" where the drive makes loud clicking sounds and crashes the system.  Drive SMART reports no errors, but that's B.S.  I bought these for backup drives, yet I cannot trust them, so what's the point?  I am waiting for Seagate to respond to my inquiries (email and support form) before I return them.\n\nBased on the stories I had read in late December, I thought these drives were out-of-the-woods, so to speak, but they are not.\n\nUpdate: Still no response from Seagate on my 2 inquiries.  Now the drive is reporting (bad) reallocated sectors.  Time for a different brand.  Scary amount of problems with less than 100 hours on the drive.\n\nUpdate: Another week and no response from Seagate.  There were some rumors on their forums that their email server crashed, and that's why they weren't responding.  Hello?  They're a drive company.  Don't they have a backup?  Maybe the server used these new Seagate drives ;)  FWIW, Seagate SD1A is not ""out of the woods"".  There is now SD1B.  Seagate claims that there is no need to update CC or LC firmware, but I and the forums say otherwise.  There is no upgraded firmware *available* if you have a -301 or -302 drive.  They are still fixing the -300 drives.\n\nUpdate: Finally got a response from Seagate after 3 weeks!  Seems what they do is not really assist you but add your email to a mailing list which directs you to their support website for updates.  My CC1H is behaving OK, but not my CC1G.  According to Seagate, the CC1G is fine, but MANY people say otherwise, and why is there a CC1J?\n\nFinal thoughts:  Seagate's last quarterly results lost $1.02 per share.  With a share price of around $4, I seriously worry if they will be around long enough to honor their warranty.  Some system builders are reporting failures in the 20-30%!";Frightening mess these drives are
33;8.0;1.0;39.0;This hard drive has a well-documented problem with freezing up, sometimes locking up your entire system. There's a firmware fix available--ONLY IF YOU BOOT INTO DOS. If you run Linux or Mac OS X, you're out of luck.;Horrible freezeup problems, no solution for Mac OS X owners
1;9.0;5.0;38.0;Not sure what the other two reviewers were having problems with. Maybe something running in the background or not enough free resources on their systems.\n\nI am able to push 1080p HD video with no stutter no stopping or starting no problems.\nI have this drive in an external enclosure using Firewire 400 and Firewire 800.\nBoth move 1080p video with no problem.\nMoving files or data it is obviously faster with the Firewire 800 cable rather than the Firewire 400.\nI don't think this drive even breaks a sweat playing an mp3.\nWith 32 mb of cache it has no problems what so ever.\nBuy it you won't be disappointed.\nWe are also testing this drive as a media drive holding approximately 500 movies that have been ripped to it. Some in 1080p HD others in 720p and some in standard def. The test drive is able to stream over a network to 5 different apple tv's and 1 other HD Media Player. The drive is in an external enclosure that has a gigabit network connection and works flawlessly. In our testing while playing all 5 apple tv's and the other hd player all 6 users reported absolutely no stuttering or cacheing of the file or data.\nIts that fast.\nSo again not sure why the other reviewers had problems with this drive stopping and starting or stuttering or re cacheing.;Good for media
16;10.0;1.0;27.0;"If you do NOT value your time, money or data - then I highly recommend this drive.  For everyone else - STAY AWAY!\n\nAs I said in the title, I truly wish I could give this drive 0 stars, and 0 stars for Seagate's support procedures, too (emphasis on procedures - I have nothing against their support reps).  I've used dozens of hard drives from many different vendors over the years (including WD, Seagate, Toshiba, Fujitsu), some were better and some were worse - but I never came close to experience anything quite like what I experienced here.\n\nBottom line - both the original drive I purchased, as well as the replacement drive I received - crashed within a couple of months of fairly low usage.  Read on if you'd like the full details.\n\nWhen I first bought the drive, it was towards the end of 2008, when Seagate was already acknowledging an issue, and began providing new firmwares.  I figured that a big company like Seagate won't be able to afford not-to-fix that issue, and decided the buy the drive despite the negative reports.  A clear mistake.\n\nWithin several days after purchase I started experiencing the same symptoms people were reporting - the drive slows to a halt, disappears from Windows, and also began to 'develop' a handful of bad sectors.  Upgrading the firmwares (multiple times, as they were released) seemed to improve the situation - but didn't really.  After less than 4 months, the drive died completely failing to spin up and manifesting the dreaded click of death.\n\nIt was the first time ever a drive failed on me while in warranty (discounting a drive that crashed when I dropped my laptop a few years ago - which was completely my fault), so it was an unpleasant surprise to receive a refurbished drive in return.  It was the very first time in my life (around 20 years of relevance) that I had a refurbished drive in any of my systems.  I checked the firmware to make sure it's not supposed to be affected - and it wasn't.  Long story short - exactly the same thing happened with this refurbished drive, only this time it only took 6 weeks.  During these 6 weeks - as the same old symptoms that happened with the 1st drive began to repeat themselves, I contacted Seagate's support and asked them what I can do to avoid losing >1.1TB of data again.  Their response was simply that these are good drives, that just a few bad sectors and a couple of spinup problems don't mean much, but that I can RMA it if I'd like.\n\nSoon thereafter, what I predicted would happen actually happened and the drive died (exact same symptoms; failing to spin up, click of death).  Thankfully I was backing it up most of it to another drive on a daily basis due to lack of trust, so I hardly lost any data.  I contacted Seagate's support and asked what I need to do in order to get a brand new drive, recently manufactured - so that it might actually live to celebrate it's first birthday instead of dying so prematurely.  Their answer was simple and consistent - sorry, no can do, we can only give you another refurbished drive, and don't worry about it - they're fine.\n\nTelling them I have next to no faith in the model, but *absolutely no faith* in another refurbished drive from the same model was of no help.  ""We'll be happy to send you another refurbished drive"".  Why Seagate expects users to be willing to trust their data with these faulty drives is beyond me - after two failures in such a short timeframe, the burden of proof should be on THEM.\n\nI have my principles, and I refuse to spend more time on these faulty drives, especially if I have no reason to believe they'd be any better than the 100% failure rate I've seen so far (for me - a drive from a new batch *might* be better and worth a shot - but I'm only considering it because I'm already 'invested' in this drive;  If you haven't bought one yet - simply STAY AWAY!).  Like I told Seagate, this drive will be going to the trash can, I'll swallow the $'s lost, and do my best to prevent others from falling to the same pitfall.\n\nBy the way - my system is properly cooled, and the drives never went above 43C.  I have 2 other WD drives in the very same system that, touch wood, have been working without a single hiccup for over two years.\n\nIf I helped prevent even one person from throwing money, but more importantly - time and data - at this drive, then it was worth writing this review.";I wish I could give it zero stars - these drives are STILL faulty as of Jun '09!
6;11.0;1.0;19.0;"OMG! You gotta be kidding about the ""Frustration-Free Packaging"" phrase. You guys really crossed the line this time.\n\nThe HDD was shipped inside a simple cardboard box without any protection to avoid receiving hits or bounces inside the box along transportation. It was surely jumping or rubbing inside the box, since the antistatic bag containing the HDD was partially broken where the connection pins are located (the more delicated parts).\n\nHopefully after the beating received the HDD will have an average life.\n\nProblem is, since this was an international order, the fact of returning the device to USA in the current condition would just rise the costs already brought to me so far.\n\nThank you for putting such a low effort in protecting a delicate electronic device like this along the shipping.\n\nThe shopping experience this time was extremely disappointing!!!";Frustration-Free Packaging ???
13;12.0;4.0;21.0;"Here is my review of the OEM, Seagate 12th series ST31000528AS 1 TB Barracuda dual platter perpendicular recording very spaciousg SATA desktop hard drive. This particular drive comes with platters with density level of 500 GB each. For this model line, there are various sizes ranging from 160 GB to 1 TB in size. I've noticed particularly, larger capacity drives comes in SATA only. It's getting harder and harder to buy a hard drive in the EIDE form, because EIDE interface is on its way out. It's being phased out by most hard drive manufacturer as well as computer motherboard manufacturer. For those of you with older computers that has only EIDE interface, you may be able to connect your computer to a SATA hard drive or optical drive by using a converter card. This card is inserted in the back of the hard drive converting a SATA drive to EIDE.\n\nI've purchased this drive to use as storage only, and petition it as one large petition of 931 GB. After installation of this drive on my computer, I use Seagate's excellent free DiscWizard software to petition the hard drive. The process is relatively quick unlike using Windows to do this. I've downloaded this hard drive utility program from the Seagate website. This is a 128 MB download and may take a while on a slower Internet connection. This program will only run if you have at least a Seagate or Maxtor hard drive on board. This hard drive utility program is really a stripped-down version of Acronis True Image Home. Partly because of this excellent utility program that I decided to stick with Seagate instead of defecting to Western Digital instead for this purchase. With this program, you can clone your old hard drive to the new under Windows or using the bootable CD R which you can make with this program. You can use this program to backup your entire hard drive as well and save it on your storage drive. If anything should happen to your Windows installation, all you would have to do is to restore it using this program in its entirety. Doing it this way, you would not have to install Windows plus updates and all of the programs that you use all over again. You can do this by just simply inserting the bootable CD, restart the computer and then follow the prompts to restore your computer. Unlike previous programs of this nature, this program does an excellent job of it. After the cloning or restore, everything appears to work fine. In my example for instance using maximum compression, I was able to save my 37 GB which was the total of my ""C"" Windows petition as a 19 GB file on my storage drive.\n\n This unreliable problem with the 11th series because its firmware problems which hurt Seagate's reputation tremendously. It's also because of that, that Seagate reduced the warranty from five years to three for consumer grade hard drives. Although, the server class NS series hard drives still remains at five years warranty. According to some of the professional reviews, they reported that this hard drive is extremely fast in fact almost as fast as one running at 10,000 RPM. I tried benchmarking this hard drive using Sandra. The test result shows a starting point at 129 MB a second read speed with a drive index of 102. The test results shows that this hard drive is slightly faster than my previous 11th series Seagate hard drive. This hard drive runs extremely quiet and relatively cool with temperature not exceeding 32C on my computer so far. This is about 5C less when compare with my previous hard drive installed in the same position under the same conditions. This according to Hard Disk Sentinel, the hard drive monitoring program. Because of the fast read and write speed of this hard drive as well as my previous one which was the Seagate 11th series, I was able to copy my files over from my old to this one in relatively short time. The old drive will be installed on my old computer to be used as storage or as Windows drive.\n\nUpdate July 17, 2009: So far, This drive has been performing extremely well and I am quite happy with the performance. Since purchased, according to S.M.A.R.T. I have 164 hours on the clock. It hasn't produced any unusual noises or other glitches.\n\nUpdate August 16, 2009: According to S.M.A.R.T. the hard drive had a minor problem, one reallocated section moved to the spare section. Other than this, the drive still works extremely well. As long as I'm not getting more new bad sections constantly it should be all right. Regardless of what, I think Seagate is slipping in quality control. Even the best of hard drives comes manufactured with bad section, that get mapped out during the first initialization process at the factory so it doesn't show up under S.M.A.R.T.. This is usually the case, why when you receive the drive it appears perfect.";Massive Storage Utilizing Perpendicular Recording Using Only Two Platters

3;15.0;2.0;27.0;I bought two of these (not from Amazon, but another vendor), and they are unusable for media or any other near real time use. Every 5-10 minutes, the drives will stop responding for a period of time (10-30 seconds). Data is not lost, but it's useless for playing back media files, as videos and even MP3s will stop playing.\n\nSMART monitoring shows no errors and that the drive is working properly.\n\nIt is possible that Seagate will fix this in firmware, or it's possible that both of the ones I received (from the same batch) are defective.  To be certain, this is Model ST31500341A  Revision: SD17\n\nI've read a few reports on the internet of others having similar issues, but then plenty of people say the drives work great.

0;18.0;1.0;24.0;I never write reviews on Amazon for anything, but in this case, I feel it is warranted. When this drive first came out a month or so ago, I couldn't believe the size for the price.

They starting clicking for a couple of days (while still working) then they just die. 3 out of 7 hard drives dying in a month is just unheard of.

Sure the drive may power up and work at first but it may have a very short life - that's exactly what happened to the last drive I ordered like this.\n\nSo until Amazon does something about the packaging, avoid these bulk drives and look for ""retail"" packaged drives on Amazon (or a local store).  They'll cost a little more but your hard drive will probably last a lot longer.\n\nI usually get annoyed when I see people post about things other than the item -- shipping delays, questions about returns, etc -- but in this case I think it's deserved.";Beware these bulk drives

They had no luck with it. So I exchanged it for another new one yesterday. I brought it home, and it would not even mount. All I heard was a clicking sound. So that one was returned also. I have since warned the computer store about the problem. Don't buy until, or if, they get all the kinks worked out of this device.;Two bad drives in a row.
9;22.0;4.0;10.0;"I very much like this drive.  It is fast, quiet, and has had a very good history in our raid servers.  HOWEVER, ordering this drive from Amazon was sadly a mistake.  Three drives were ordered last week and when they arrived our IT department was blown away at the lack of packaging.  Three drives were placed in a large box free to slosh, clank, and bang into each other.  The only padding that was included was air filled bags.  The drives, of course, failed every test our raids put on them just to initialize them.  Our Raid server immediately upon installing the drives notified us that all three drives were experiencing extreme data loss and should be replaced as soon as possible.\n\nLove the drives and love Amazon but I have to suggest ordering them from any other vendor until Amazon realizes that ""approved"" packaging is not 3 small drives placed into a 14"" x 10"" box to slosh around.

24;23.0;2.0;13.0;I purchased this drive on Amazon and used it in an HP MediaSmart EX470 Windows Home Server to increase storage. While playing video from the server the video stream would start to stutter and freeze. I spent 2 months troubleshooting through a strict process of elimination, ruling out the Client PCs, the managed gigabit switch, the HP Server, its software and hardware. When I read of all the problems with the 1.5tb drive I tried removing it from the server,of course everything worked flawlessly with the drive gone, returning the drive to the server the problem continued. Searching the links that the previous review had posted I found many others experiencing this problem. I tried many fo the suggestions such as disabling write cache, I updated the firmware to Brinks-4D8H-SD1B from Seagate's website unfortunately the problem has not been resolved.\n\nI chose the 1.5tb drive as the HP sever only has 4 drive bays and I wanted to maximize storage density. Little did I know I would lose nearly 100hrs of my life chasing this problem down. I don't know if Amazon will accept a return, I certainly don't want a replacement drive from Seagate. I also purchased a 1tb Western Digital Caviar Black that has performed well. My next purchase will certainly not be from Seagate.;Freezing problem persists after firmware update
37;24.0;5.0;13.0;"There is much discuasion of the performance of this drive when used in RAID arrays. [...]\n\n The drive that notably beat the Seagate was the WD RE3. The real competition for the Seagate is the WD Caviar Black which the drive met or beat on virtually every test.\n\nSome background info:Both the 1Tb WD Black and the Seagate 1.5Tb had an issue with long ""timeouts"" caused by the drives ""self-standardization"" or ""cache-flushing"" (I'm not SURE of the technical details) at intervals. This ""off-line"" appearance of the drives caused the drive to a) drop out of the RAID configuration b) be ""ejected"" from the array due to ""read/write errors"" c) ""hang"" for up to 30 seconds or so.  Needless to say, these cause major problems in the speed and efficiency of the RAID arrays.\n\nThe most important thing to note is the major difference in corporate response to the using the drives in RAID arrays. I don't have the exact quote, but WD pretty much said ""the Black is not approved for RAID use and will not be supported in this application. Use the RE3 drives"".  This varies MARKEDLY in the response of SEAGATE which was to work with users and issue firmware patches to meet customer expectatioins. The response of WD on this issue was, imho, unforgivable.. I mean its true that the drives, if applied to a true corporate environment RAID array which has very severe throughput and percent utilization challenges, is a special case. However, for home users, probably 90% of new motherboards contain SATA RAID options built in. For this reason combined with the great prices on HD's now encourage MANY MANY home users to begin using RAID configurations on their home setups. By any stretch of the imagination drives used this way get no more severe utilization than the same drives used in a single drive configuration.\n\n[b]Huge KUDO's go to SEAGATE[/b] for the way in which they have tried to support this 1.5 Tb drive while WD needs to have their ears pinned back for their ""corporate speak"" response to this issue. The RE3 is, on a cost per Gb basis, about 2.25 times the cost of the Seagate 1.5Tb. The 1Tb Caviar Black is the ""comparable"" drive (still somewhat more expensive  $/Gb than this Seagate) and it isn't supported by WD in a RAID array!!!  Pffft on WD!\n\nPS: I am a long time user of both brands of drives and previously was slightly biased toward WD.. but this incident weighs on my mind considerably\n\n(edit added) To summarize:\nSeagate 1.5Tb  approx cost /Gb 0.085 .. RAID supported (need updates)\nWD Black 1.0Tb approx cost /Gb 0.120 .. Not supported in RAID\nWD RE3 1.0Tb  approx cost /Gb 0.180 .. Certified for RAID\n\nAll have 5yr warranties, and based on my past experience (I've not had a failure with any of these drives) their warranty services are very good. But if you're having RAID application issues with the WD Black, you won't get support.";Seagate gets  a PLUS from me
47;25.0;5.0;13.0;"I have this drive and it works great. A couple of people are saying that this drive is slow or pauses when transferring files or playing media. They need to check to make sure that there are no jumpers set. This drive normally operates at 300 MB/sec. See below from Seagate's page:\n\n""It is not necessary to set any terminators or other settings on this drive for proper operation. The jumper block adjacent to the SATA interface connector on SATA 150MB/sec drives is for factory use only. The jumper block adjacent to the SATA interface connector on SATA 300MB/sec drives can be used to force the drive into SATA 150MB/sec mode for use with older SATA controllers that only work with SATA 150MB/sec drives.""\n\nThe jumper setting can be seen here [...]\n\nIf your system is sata 1 then you will need this jumper set. If your system is sata 1 and the jumper is not set that could be causing the pause problem since the drive is trying to send the data faster than the system can accept it. If you system is sata 2 and the jumper is set then this could cause slow read/writes.";Users having problems should check jumper settings
5;26.0;1.0;5.0;"YET ANOTHER UPDATE:\n\nEXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE. Seagate called me today. They're swapping out my 1.5 TB drives for new 2GB Constellations on an advanced replacement basis. All I have to pay is shipping! The Constellations are Enterprise class (ES) drives that run about $300 a pop (here on Amazon - retail's higher).\n\nSeagate's my new favorite company, they've got a customer for life.\n\nUPDATE - PROBLEM IDENTITIED:\n\nSince I wrote the review below, I've had 2 more 1.5 TB drives fail. I called Seagate to try to resolve the issue, and was told (by 3 different people in 2 different departments) that these drives are NOT RELIABLE in RAID configurations.\n\nAccording to Seagate, they market them as 'desktop' drives which means they are designed to be used for a few hours a day rather than continuously. Apparently they're fine for non-RAID use (one person told me they work OK for RAID-0 and RAID-1, although I'm not sure how that would be different from RAID-5).\n\nThis may explain the number of problems that some people (like me) have with these drives while they work perfectly fine for others. I wish I had known this before I bought the drives to begin with.\n\n==================================\n\nOver the last 2+ decades I've owned hundreds of hard drives. I can say with certainty that the Seagate 1.5 TB drive is the worst of the lot, and not by a little.\n\nAt the moment, I've got 22 drives in service. 12 of them are Seagate 1 TB enterprise (ES) drives. 6 of them are WD 160 MB drives. 4 of them are Seagate 1.5 TB drives. Over the last six months I've had 7 drive failures.  5 of them have been Seagate 1.5 TB drives (the other two were ancient WD-160's).  You read that right - 5 failures in a pool of 4 drives.\n\nThese are not heat or power related failures. The servers run behind a high-end power conditioning UPS and are well ventilated; the drives are barely warm to the touch when I swap them out.\n\nI wouldn't recommend these drives to my worst enemy.\n\nJust to be clear, my problem is specifically with the Seagate 1.5 TB drives. Their 1 TB drives seem to be very reliable.";Another one bites the dust
17;27.0;4.0;10.0;A disk drive to me is one of those things that don't get much notice unless they don't work well.  I don't notice this one.  It works well and seems to be fairly fast.  It's quiet.  It has a SATA connection.  It has more space than most people could reasonably use.\n\nSince I have little interest in running tests to determine actual figures for maximum burst speed and so on that's about all I can say and all I care about.  Well, I care about reliability too, but how can I comment on that at this early stage? I have to trust Seagate's reputation for that - and take backups!\n\nYou get a heck of a lot of space for a very reasonable price with this drive.  If I was building another machine in the near future I'd certainly buy another.;It works. It's big.  It's fast.  What more do you need?
2;28.0;3.0;11.0;I, also, bought this hard drive (not from Amazon) and have experienced the same thing with media (audio in iTunes) playback. There was a noticeable lag every so often and I had to move my library back to the other drive that I was migrating from. However, the drive is VERY good for backups, archiving and general storage as it has a usable space of 1.36 TB (1,360 GB) which is MORE than enough for a daily backup of my boot drive, a weekly backup of my iTunes library and Toast images of all of my software CDs so that I have access to all of my software without wasting time searching around for them later.\n\nAll in all, a very good, LARGE storage drive (5 stars) but a poor media playback drive (1 star). Good for room, not for iTunes.;Good for massive storage, not good for media playback
35;29.0;4.0;10.0;After a brutal introduction with faulty firmware that caused many users to hate this drive, Seagate has finally got it right and produced a firmware that allows this monster to work to its full potential. Now shipping with the most recent firmware, this is a fantastic backup drive or media storage drive. I use it in my home server as the storage location for all my media. It works great for that purpose, and with a media extender, plays all my movies (most are standard definition DVDs) flawlessly over my n-band wireless signal. I can stream to my wife's laptop, either of my TVs (via media extender) and it all works flawlessly. I don't have any issue with cache dumping. So if you are reading all the negative reviews, consider that it appears the many initial problems have been taken care of.\n\nI have some reservations about the long term quality of this dive, but for that, only time will tell. I think I will get another one and mirror it with my current drive so that if one crashes I have a backup. Seagate has a good warranty, so I'm not TOO concerned about it.\n\nOnce a real nightmare because of bad firmware, now a great and reasonably priced media/back up drive, this one is a good investment assuming it stays healthy over time.;With the newest firmware this drive is fantastic

7;32.0;1.0;6.0;I purchased this OEM (meaning no box or manual, just the drive) hard drive from Amazon. Shipping took almost two weeks. But I can not believe it when I received the box. I could hear the drive bouncing around in the box. I could not believe it. I opened the box and that was NO packing what so ever in the box. Just the drive in anti static wrap and the packing list. The static bag was pretty beat up and had holes in the corners where it had banged around in the box during shipping. I am returning this drive. I will not risk my data to a drive that has traveled the country rattling around in box for days.\nI can hardly believe Amazon would ship anything in this manner, especially a fragile hard drive.\nI have purchased many things for Amazon, like books and they have enough bubble wrap and those air bags to take a beating, but a hard drive, come one, Amazon you can do better and should know better.\nGo forward I will stick to books, heck after this, maybe not even that.\n\nI have photos and video of the box and drive showing it being opened for the first time.\n\nI would recommend buying computer equipment from a computer company and not a book company that does not know how to ship.;Shipped without any packing material  - NONE

So I sent it back to Seagate for a replacement, and ordered another one from Amazon.\nRight now, I am only using these drives for redundant backup, and based on reviews that I have read, the rate of failure on these things is pretty high.\nBottom line: these drives are probably good only for high-speed large redundant storage situations, where you can afford to lose a drive without negative consequences.\nFor a primary, large, high-speed drive that is reliable, I recommend the 1TB WD ""black"".";fast but unreliable?

22;36.0;5.0;7.0;I just received this drive, and I'm very happy with it. I wouldn't call it noisy, but there are quieter drives out there, but it's a nice compromise between performance and quiet for a system drive, and the noise isn't obtrusive. The drive runs very quiet as well. Temps are right around 30C in my Antec Fusion Remote Max. The drive is in a separate compartment with the PSU, so only receives a bit a passive cooling from the PSU fan and the air that gets drawn through the vent underneath the drive. My previous drive was a Seagate 7200.9 300GB, and it was significantly louder and ran hotter (about 47-50C in the same location).\n\nOverall I'd say this is a great value drive for a mid-level system.;Great value

I know this now b/c on the latest RMA which i'm packaging right now, the Seagate rep offered to change it to a .12 on the return. I lost a significant amount of work both times, although less the 2nd time because I was paranoid after the first. I work in an industry where large video and image files are the norm, and I can't spend a bunch of time burning files that I'm working on. i need reliability in my storage.\n\nThis used to be an incredibly reliable company, and it's too bad that their large capacity stuff is so lousy.  In the case of this one, the model# I bought didn't match what the drive detect program read it as, so it couldn't apply any of the downloaded firmware updates (even though drivedetect was showing it as needing one).  The rep at Seagate told me I'd have to download it directly. When I did (I was doing all this b/c the drive was running too slowly to use) the drive was bricked and my OS told me I had to reformat. I'm getting rid of everything I own made by Seagate and never returning. I haven't had products this bad since Maxtor.  Probably not a coincidence they bought them.  Avoid at all costs unless you don't care about your data.;Unacceptable failure rate

I was hesitant after the problems with version 11 but after reading a review on how fast there drives were and reading that the version 12 drives were fixed I went ahead.

I isolated the clicking drive by pulling the power from the drives one by one. It was one of the RAID drives. I sent it back to Amazon and received a new drive. I installed the new drive, the RAID rebuilt itself. Less than 24 hours later my system started to slow and the clicking started again. This time it was the Boot Drive.

25;45.0;4.0;5.0;I bought two (one for primary drive and one for backup use).  One inside workstation, another inside esata/usb external enclosure.  I just had to try them, as they blow away everything solely on price.\n\nOf course, I focused in on the reliability and firmware problems.  Mine came with CC1H, I believe, and Seagate's site says that I do not need to worry.  So far (after around a month), they have performed fine (I was not expecting speed demons, and they are not compared to some drives on the market like the raptors, but they are definitely faster than the now three-generation old 500GB drives they are replacing in my setup).\n\nI would point two things out:  First, I definitely can generate the clicking sound which usually signals imminent drive failure.  My external enclosure can sit on its side, and when I leave it in that orientation, that is exactly what happens.  As far as I can tell, no problems with drive performance nor function occur, though.  Second, I have had some trouble getting my esata drive connection to work in Vista Ultimate.  It works fine in Fedora and Ubuntu Linux, so I assume it might be a driver problem.  It shows up initially, and then drops out (it scared me because this was similar behaviour to people who noticed problems with raid arrays using this drive).  Maybe it is the same problem--but since I do not use them in raid . . .  I do know, though, as this is not a problem when I use USB.  Since I use the external as only a backup drive, it does not matter to me a great deal.;They *seem* to be fine, now

31;47.0;2.0;5.0;"I bought two of these 1.5 TB disk drives in Dec 2008 for $120 each and free shipping. I've bought a lot of hard drives dating back to 1982.  And this is the first hard drive I've ever had fail in my life. It worked less than a day and now all it does is make clicking noises as if the read head is searching for the track, but cannot find it. The other 1.5 TB drive is working fine.  I bought Seagate's 1 TB ST31500341AS NCQ model a few months ago and I think I will buy that model again. That model still uses three 333 GB platters versus three 500 GB platters on the 1.5 GB disk. Furthermore, the NCQ (native command queuing) on the 1 TB model provides significantly faster performance on fragmented files. There is an implied reference to NCQ on the 1.5 TB model, but I cannot find anything in print from Seagate that says it explicitly. I don't think the 500 GB platters in the 1.5 TB disks are quite ready for prime time.  It is probably best to wait another six months to a year for this higher density technology to mature.\nUpdate;\nI received a replacement unit very promptly, and other than the fact the replacement is refurbished, it works.

32;48.0;2.0;5.0;EDITED REVIEW: Ok, I wrote a review earlier prior to receiving my 2nd drive from Amazon. I received a drive with the CC1H firmware and it is totally awesome, no failures whatsoever, no streaming issues, no lockups - no failure to detect the drive, etc... btw I use windows only, no Mac or linux etc, and have not used this drive in a Raid setup. My plan was to exchange the drive I received which had the SD17 firmware that I updated to SD1A. I still had problems with streaming video and video playback in general - read my review earlier for more details. I say WAS going to exchange. Since receiving the new drive I checked one last time on the Seagate website for firmware and found they now have SD1B firmware for my original drive. After flashing the firmware - which went very smoothly and did not destroy any existing data - it seems to work at or very near the same level as my other drive with the CC1H firmware. The drive is incredibly fast in tests with HD Tune software - my max read speed with either drive is always over 102 Mb/s and that is better than my Raid 0 setup that gets 70 Mb/s or better for maximum sustained read speed - and that is with 2 250gb Seagate drives, which performs very nicely for a moderate desktop system. I'd like to try it in a Raid 0 but I think I'll just keep the 2nd drive as a spare. I decided to just keep the 1st drive and the 5 year warranty Seagate offered until early this year. Seems to be a solid drive now after the update - it does get warm so I recommend a ventilated enclosure with a fan for sure with these to get maximum life.\n\n(OLD REVIEW) I have had this drive for a few weeks, and I called Seagate when I first got the drive because I read about the firmware problem. Well, they told me I had the SD17 firmware and that was one of the drives that may need to be updated, but they wouldn't give me the download unless I experienced problems. Well after trying to use the drive, I couldn't even boot on my Asus a8v motherboard, tried different jumper settings and nothing would help, so connected it to another pc and it was detected with that one. Instead of waiting for another 1/2 hour for Seagate tech support I ended up downloading the firmware posted on that Eggy site and did a firmware update using a usb flash drive. The update was successful and I thought that would be end of story. Well, it still wouldn't be detected with the Asus motherboard (Via 83837 SATA chipset - sata I) so, I figured it wasn't compatible with the chipset even though other sata II drives worked fine. I decided to use a external usb/eSata enclosure with the drive, I copied about 900 gb of data onto it - music/mpeg files etc and things seemed to work ok, but the transfer speed (read / write speed) was much slower than it would have been with the sata connection. Anyways, using this drive for a media center pc / dvr became a nightmare - it would stop / freeze about 20 minutes into the movie. It stops and then is not detected by the pc. I could sometimes go to standby then come back and it would work again, other times, I have to shut down completely and reboot. It is almost impossible to watch anything straight through on this. I have tried disabling the write cache (in device manager - drives - optimize for quick removal / or for performance) and either way it has problems. I am sending back for replacement and I hope I get a better drive - I used to trust Seagate and for the past 5 years have been very pleased with them until this drive.;Think I got a lemon - NOW I take it back - 5 Stars now
40;49.0;1.0;5.0;it worked great for 7 days,  then worked at 1/4 speed for 3 days, i read about the firmware update trying to get speed back up due to the 32mb buffer issue, no prob i thought follow directions  change the firmware.  after the attempted firmware update i have a 2 pd paper weight that doesnt even spin up at boot.  seagate just lost all future buisness from me.  i should have stuck with old reliable  western digital.  don't buy this piece of junk. lost all 1.36 tb of video  thanks seagate;absolute junk
42;50.0;1.0;5.0;I should have believed the other reviews.  After about 15 minutes of working, I was no longer able to access the drive.  And ofter 2 days of trying different things, I returned it for the 1TB.;Failure

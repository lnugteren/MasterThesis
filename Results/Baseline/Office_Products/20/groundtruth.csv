4;1.0;4.0;101.0;"This bag will work just fine for what I wanted it for. I read many reviews before purchasing and I'd like to clarify things I still had questions/concerns about. This is not an ""extra large"" bag. But the demensions don't lie. It is what they say they are. I don't have an extra large bible that I needed to fit in it, and my standard size bible fits perfectly. Because I don't have an extra large bible and because I'm not using this case as a jacket cover for my bible, (I wanted more of a carrying cas) I can use the flaps as pockets for my notebooks and devotion book, as well as tucking my bible in the other side. There are 2 holders to keep pens as well. I even through my small clip board in there which I keep all of my church's weekly bulletins. Zipped it all up and have everything I need for church or bible study all in one case. Exactly what I was looking for. I didn't give 5 stars because I do find the quality of the case to be a little ""plastic"" like, but not enough to return it or not use it. (And..it was really inexpensive) and I also think the design of the zipper is poor and it's hard to get started when you're ready to close. All things considered, I would definitely recommend this item to keep you organized and ready for your study!";This bag will work just fine for what I wanted it for
2;2.0;5.0;12.0;Perfect for my Dake KJV study Bible.  Its a large Bible and was concerned I might not find a cover.  It is a very nice one.;Perfect for my Dake Bible
16;3.0;4.0;49.0;I do appreciate the warm rich color and texture of this bible cover.  I expect the quality workmanship will hold up for a number of years to comes.  Perhaps the only thing missing is an outside pocket on either side that would make it easier to slide in notes,  etc. rather than opening up the entire case when on the run.\n\nDefinetly worth the cost.;Bible cover
19;4.0;5.0;48.0;Love Love, this Bible cover.  The ladies at church were wanting to know where I got it......My favorite feature is, I can close and not worry about zipping....I used the fob and attached it to the zipper to make it much easier to zip up...  My other cover had the handle in the binder edge...not good..... Nice and roomy....Couldn't ask for anything more...;Beautiful
10;5.0;4.0;31.0;"It is a nice looking case. Note that it is NOT leather; it is leather-like. This is not a bad thing though because if it gets dirty, it can be easily cleaned with disinfecting wipes and not ruin the material. Fits my bible perfectly. Wish it had an accordion pocket inside to hold a note book or flyers. Great item for the cost and I believe it will hold up to the amount of use it will get.";It is a nice looking case
0;6.0;5.0;46.0;Bought this case as a gift for my mom, she loves it!!! The color is very nice beautiful deep dark red wine looking excellent material and craftsmanship. I wish they made this color with out the purse handles because I would buy one for my Bible.;My mom loves it
7;7.0;3.0;24.0;"Note, that this case&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reptile-Leather-Extra-Large-Wine-Bible-Cover/dp/0310821800/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reptile Leather Extra Large Wine Bible Cover</a>t does NOT fit the size Bible that you might think from the product description.  Amazon lists this product as 11.2 x 7.6 x 3 inches.  But it will only hold a Bible up to 9.75 inches high by approx 7 inches wide.  Not sure why they call this an ""Extra Large.""  It is only a large ... and barely that.  There is a tag attached to the case when you receive it that gives the actual max Bible size and it is nowhere near the product size.  That all said, it is a fine looking purse-style case that my wife loves (she is using it for a smaller Bible) and appears to be very well made.  Now I am on the hunt for a case that will hold her 11 x 7.5 x 2 inch KJV Super Extra Large Print Study Bible.";it is a fine looking purse-style case that my wife loves (she is ...
1;8.0;5.0;43.0;Perfect transaction and the item is exactly as described! Fits a rather large size Bible perfectly, no worries! I would not hesitate to recommend this seller, or this product.;Fabulous cover!
3;9.0;1.0;5.0;This was the greatest distortion of the TRUTH I  have ever seen. This was described as EXTRA LARGE!\nWhich is TOTALLY UNTRUE!!! I consider this bag to be MEDIUM sized..... Seems you can't believe all you read, Will be MORE CAREFUL in the future.\nDON'T PURCHASE IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN EXTRA LARGE BAG..;This was the greatest distortion of the TRUTH I have ever seen
18;10.0;5.0;30.0;It is made from very good material and very well put together. It is durable, has a place to hold pens & highlighters, and my extra large Bible fits perfectly.;Love it!
5;11.0;5.0;5.0;This does fit the larger Bible.  It is hard to find this size.;Five Stars
6;12.0;1.0;9.0;"Attractive looking carrier but I just bought it and the handles are already ripping from the seems. I was happy to find such an attractive carrying case for my extra large bible however this case cannot handle the weight of an extra large bible obviously.

15;13.0;5.0;19.0;"This bag was perfect for my ""oversized"" Bible.  It is very well made and worth every penny.  It also was large enough for the chapter dividers.  If you are looking for a Bible Cover this is it!";Nice quality!
9;14.0;4.0;11.0;Just received the bible cover and it is beautiful. One problem, in the product description it's dimensions are listed as 13.5 x 9.6 x 3.9 inches. It's actually 11.5x7.5x3 inches. I'm keeping it because I have enough women in my family that one of them will use it. But, I have to find one that has the listed dimensions. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars.;Just received the bible cover and it is beautiful. One problem
8;15.0;2.0;7.0;Quality is excellent but to small for my study bible. In must struggle zipping it up each time.  Needs to be a little bigger then it would be perfect.  Not sure who I need to contact with this problem but I need a bible cover that fits,  please give me feedback on a Bible cover that fits.  Please if. U Say it fits it needs to fit.  I am disabled or I would have sent it back.  Please make it right.;To small
17;16.0;5.0;12.0;The cover is excellent and as advertised. The leather is substantial. The color is even and what I was expecting. It is roomy and I have plenty of room for my Bible, even with tabs on it. The straps are handy to carry it.\n\nShipping was not fast but not especially slow either, with the item arriving in about 9 business days.;Excellent Bible cover
14;17.0;5.0;10.0;This works great for the larger size study bibles.  I have the larger ESV Study Bible and this fits it perfectly.  Beautifully rich color.  Do wish it had a pen holder but still plenty of room to toss one in.;Finally...Study Bible size!
13;18.0;1.0;8.0;Reptile leather is really cheap-looking plastic. I could tell that the bits of plastic that held the handles was not going to last. Returned for refund.;Cheap looking plastic
11;19.0;5.0;5.0;I love it.  I have a large Bible and had a hard time finding one that would fit. This works very well and is off good quality material. I would highly recommend this Bible cover and it is very stylish.;I love it. I have a large Bible and had ...
12;20.0;1.0;5.0;I did not find any leather in this Bible Cover.  I do like the purse style and believe it is easier on the spine of large study Bibles.  However I wanted a leather cover and returned these because they were not a discribed.  Amazon was very gracious to give me a full refund and pay for all shipping.;plastic, not leather
